By Nov. 19, 1851, James was situated as a teacher on a plantation near Trinity in Cata- houla Parish and Mary was at Rapides Female Seminary eighteen miles from Alexandria. On that date he wrote to his mother why he per- suaded his sister they could not afford to settle in New Orleans. Soon after Mary wrote to her parents on Jan. 1, 1852, she became ill, and she died on Jan. 31 at the age of twenty- three. In one of her brother's communications    ","Wilson, Jay"

James's first job in Louisiana was on the plantation of one Liddell who had graduated from     West Point. In Mary's letter of Jan. 1 she said James had left Mr. Liddell's, and she expressed doubt that because of his timidity and youthful appearance he was going to make a success at teaching.

By Nov. 14, 1852, James was teaching in a school but was very critical of his principal, of his lack of ade- quate education,and of the way he was operating the school. About a month later, James re- minded his mother in a letter how she had taught him grammar, Latin, spelling, and arith-  metic.    ","Wilson, Jay"
"Wilson, Jay 9°     By May 21, 1853, James was again in Bethel, Vt. His friend A. D. McCoy wrote to him from Alexandria, expressing the desire that he find a governess for his family and a poor, indus- trious, sober, and honest family for him to employ. By the fall of 1861 James was married  and had taken his wife Jenny to New York for medical treatment. The collection reveals nothing further about her health. An undated letter reports on the condition of the ""God's acre"" where Mary was buried and quotes the in- scription on her tombstone.    ","Wilson, Jay"
