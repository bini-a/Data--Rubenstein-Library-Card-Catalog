the Spanish Consulate in Charleston, South
Carolina, by the Madrid Government, by Spanish

diplomatic and consular representatives in the
United States, and by governing officials in
Florida, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. Several of the
earlier letters are addressed to the vice-
consul at Savannah, Georgia. In 1803, however,

The papers of the 1790's and the first years
of the 1800's are chiefly concerned with Florida
they reveal Spanish fears that American or Eng-

 

lish expeditions will wrest the sparsely-popu-
lated and poorly-defended provinces from the
Spanish crown. On January 7, 1794, the Spanish
commander in St. Augustine, Juan Nepomuceno de

 
5

Quesada, informs John (Juan) Wallace, the Bri-
tish consul in Savannah who temporarily is acting
as Spain's consular agent for Georgia and the
Carolinas, that Col. Samuel Hammond and Lt. Hard
are raising troops in Georgia, swearing alle-
giance to France, and preparing an attack .on East
Florida. Similar movements are revorted in Sout
Carolina. On January 22, 1794, Juan Nepomuceno
Quesada writes to Governor George Mathews of

Georgia informing him that 700 men have been

gathered by Hammond and asking him to maintain
U. S. neutrality. In letters to Wallace on "'
March 15 and May 12, 1794, and April 28, 1796,
the Spanish commander continues his discussion
of the invasion plans.

The treaty of peace signed between France and

 

Spain in 1796 brought Spain into a costly war
with England. Om April 7, 1797, the Spanish
Ambassador to the United States, Carlos Martfnez

de Yrujo y Tacon, Marqués de Casa Yrujo, in-
structs Diego Morphy, consul in Charleston, to
work with the French consul there, -M. Dupont, in
an effort to prevent an English expedition a-
gainst Florida. On April 17 the Marqués de Casa
Yrujo acknowledges receipt of a letter from

 

Morphy saying that General Elijah Clarke has re-
fused a proposal by the English consul that he
attack Florida. On May 16, 1797, in a letter to

 
8
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
Morphy, the ambassador expresses disapproval of
Dupont's efforts to have Clarke raise and command
American troops against England. Such actions,
he continues, may offend the United States. To
defend Florida, Spain turned to her French ally.
On June 16, 1797, Morphy informs Manuel de Ren-
gil, vice-consul in Savannah, that the sloop
Santa Rosa will carry a number of Frenchmen to
St. Augustine to populate and defend the ¢r*-
vince. In two letters, July 15 and July 19,

Yrujo urges that proof of English intrigues with
Clarke and Senator William Blount of Tennessee

the negotiations in progress between Andrew El-
licott and D. Manuel Gayosa de Lemos, Governor
of Louisiana.

To Spanish officials in Georgia, South Caro-

land brought numerous problems. One of these
was privateering, concerning which there are sev
eral letters (1798-1894). But in 1800 the chief
cause of alarm seems tO have been William Augus-
tus Bowles, regarded by the Spaniards as an Eng-
lish agent. On June 18, 1800, Francisco de
Paula Gelabert, an assistant of Governor Vicente
Folch of West Florida, informs Rengil that Bowles
has captured the fort at Apalache (St. Mark's).

Folch is leading an expedition to recover the
post. On June 30, 1800, Folch informs Rengil
that he will honor Rengil's promises to the In-
dians provided the Indians capture and deliver
Bowles to Spanish authorities. On July 23, 1800
Rengil writes to Enrique White, governor of East
Florida, that Folch has recaptured Apalache but
that Bowles escaped. Folch announces to Rengil
on August 1, 1800, that he has offéred a reward
of 4,500 pesos for Bowles’ capture.

There is a gap in the papers from 1809 to
1830. The papers of the 1830's, except those
dealing with routine commercial matters, are
largely concerned with political affairs in
Spain. There is a copy of an amnesty decree by
Ferdinand VII (Dee. 17, 1830), and copies of two
amnesty decrees by the Queen Regent, Maria Cris-
tina de Borbdn (Oct. 30, 1832 and May 20, 1834).
A decree of August 21, 1834, prohibits the ship-

ber 16, 1834, proclaim a blockade of the north-
ern coast of Spain. On December 26, 1834, Fran-
cisco Tacon, the secretary of the Spanish lega-
tion, informs the consul in Charleston, Vicente
Antonio de Larranaga, that the upper house of the
Cortes has approved a measure excluding from the
Spanish throne Don Carlos and his descendants.
On September 30, 1835, Pablo Chacon, the consul
general, writes that Maria Cristina has pro-
claimed a new constitution, to which all Spaniards

 

 
14

must swear allegiance.

A letter of February 20, 1841, concerns the
Amistad case. Ambassador Pedro Aledntara Argaiz
writes to Larranaga that he expects a favorable
ruling from the Supreme Court; he asks that a
ship from Charleston be prepared to carry the

 

slaves to Cuba. (For information on the Amistad
case, see French Ensor Chadwick, The Relations
of the United States and Spain: Diplomacy, New

Throughout much of the nineteenth century a
major concern of Spanish officials was Cuba and
and the fear that American 4id would render suc-
cessful one of the numerous Spanish uprisings
on the island. On January 27, 1849, ambassador
Angel Calderon de la Barca informs Larrafaga
that travelers carrying; prohibited newspapers to
Cuba will be severely punished. On February 23,
1849, he asks Larranaga for information concern-
ing Carlos S. Gardener, thought to be associated

 

 
16
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
with the ex-General Narciso: Lépez. Ina letter
to Larrafiaga dated August 14, 1849, Calderon de
la Barea speaks of an expedition about to leave
for Cuba from New Orleans and sends a copy of a
presidential proclamation condemning it. On
September 13, 1849, he urges all consuls and
vice-consuls to inform the Captain General of
Cuba of any preparations being made against the
islands On October 24, 1849, he states that al-
though temporarily halted, expeditions are still

 

 
17
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Cdrolina. Charleston.
being planned.

Throughout the 1850's Spanish officials dis-
play increasing concern over Cuba. On February
25, 1850, Calderon de la Barca informs Larrafaga
that Narciso Lépez is going south, either to
Charleston or Mobile; the consul is ordered to

 

supply the Captain General with all possible in-
formation about Ldépez. The ambassador writes on
May 18, 1850, to Larrafiaga that the United States
Government has at last agreed to take energetic

 
18
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.

steps to frustrate expeditions against Cuba. In
a letter of September 3, 1850, to all Federal
marshals, district attorneys, and port collec-
tors, Secretary of State Daniel Webster refers
to the presidential neutrality proclamation of
August 11, 1849, a copy of which is attached.
On September 13, 1850, Calderon de la Barca
states that the enemies of Spain are gathering
in Charleston, Savannah, and Mobile; the consuls
are urged to be especially vigilant and to en-

 

 
19

Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
list the aid of Federal officials. Ina letter
of November 28, 1850, to Larrafaga, the ambas-
sador expresses fear of another expedition, but
states that Webster doesn't think these fears
justified.

Valentin Canedo Miranda becomes Captain Gen-

 

eral of Cuba in April,1852. On April 17 he asks
for Larraflaga's cooperation in combating the en-
emies of Spain. On September 2 he informs the

consul that, for a reward, a Cuban has led gov-

 
20

ernment officials to the printing press of the
revolutionary La Voz del Pueblo; the operators of
the press have been captured and will be tried.
On October 24, 1852, Caneda Miranda writes Lar-
ranaga that he will be glad to permit the sale of
the Charleston Courier in Cuba, provided its edi-

torials are firgt eybe fgoei teed for censorship.
On February 5, the new Spanish ambassa-

dor in Washington, Leopoldo Augusto de Cueto,
writes to Larrafaga that conspirators against

 

 

 

 
Ze
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston. ; i
Cuba have obtained four steamers and four sail-
ing vessels; ‘they will embark as passengers from
New York, Charleston, and Savannah and will go
to a point farther south to pick up arms. The
plans are attributed to John Anthony Quitman. On
December 4, 1855, Alfonso de Escalante, who re-

 

placed Cueto as ambassador, writes to Larranaga
that Cuban refugees are making new plans for an
expedition. Gabriel Garcfa y Tassara, ambassador

 
22
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.

 

from 1857 to 1867, writes on November 30, 1858,
that he thinks William Walker, now unable to go
to Nicaragua, may instead lead an expedition a-
gainst Cuba. Larrafiaga is instructed to obtain
all possible information concerning Walker and
his associates; he is also asked to secure in-
formation about the Cuban Junta in New Orleans
which allegedly is planning to launch an ex-
pedition in late December.

The secession of the Southern states and the

 
23
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
outbreak of the Civil War temporarily diverted
American attention from Cuba and permitted Spain
to relax her guard against filibustering. By
1866, however, Cuban rebels and their American
supporters are again seeking to overthrow Span-

 

ish rule. On October 11, 1866, Garcid y Tassara
calls the attention of the consul in Charleston,
Francisco Munoz Ramdén de Moncada, to an article

in the New York Herald (Oct. 10) about a society

organized by John C. Braine, called the "Knights

 

 
24
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
of Arabia." The purpose of the organization is
said to be to capture and divide "a determined
territory," probably Cuba. According to the ar-
ticle the society will launch an expedition of
20,000 men within a month from New York, New Or-
leans, and Mobile.

Little reference to Cuba is found in the pa-
pers of 1867-1868. But the correspondence of
1869 reveals Spain's growing fear over the fate
of Cuba. On February 26, 1869, Moncada warns the

 

 
25
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
Captain General, Domingo Dulce y Garay, that it
would be well to send a cruiser to patrol the
coasts of Florida and Georgia. On March 20,
1869, ambassador Mauricio Ldpez Roberts advises
Moncada that the filibustering organizations

 

have established headquarters in Charleston and
other Southern cities; Moncada is ordered to en-
list the aid of Federal officials in order to
hinder the filibusterers.

 
26
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.

Copies of several letters from Moncada to
Lopez Roberts contain information on filibuster-
ing expeditions and are of special interest be-
cause of their references to a number of former
Confederates. On March 21, 1869, Moncada writes
that a ship commanded by Frank Bonneau of
Charleston - a former slave trader, captain of a
blockade-runner, and associate of General Thomas
Jordan - is to arrive in Savannah for the pur-

 

 
27
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
pose of taking on arms and provisions for the
Cuban insurgents. Moncada continues by stating
that public opinion in the South is generally
opposed to any aggression against Cuba. South-
erners believe that such aggression is a radical
movement on the part of the North designed to
annex Cuba, abolish slavery, and extend to the
Negroes of the island the same rights that they
enjoy in the United States and that are used to

 

 
28
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
promote radical Reconstruction. Although many
adventurous and unemployed Southerners might en-
list in filibustering expeditions, the capital
and arms for such expeditions are Northern. In
another letter of March 21 Moncada informs Lépez
Roberts that the Henry Burden has returned from
Cuba after disembarking on the Cuban coast the
ex-Confederate General Thomas Jordan and about
thirty more ex-Confederate officers, most of
whom are artillerists. On March 24 Moncada

 

 

 
28a
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
south Carolina. Charleston.
writes the ambassador that the Henry Burden has
arrived at the Bay of South Edisto; on the same
day he writes to the customs officer in Charles-
ton demanding that U. S. neutrality laws be en-
forced. In another letter to Ldévez Roberts on

 

 

March 24, Moncada urges that private detectives
be hired to obtain information concerning fili-
bustering. expeditions. On March 29, 1869, Mon-

 
29
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
cada again assures the ambassador that senti-
ment in Charleston is opposed to filibustering.
Two former captains of block2de-runners have
offered their services to Spain. Moncada's pro-
test of the Union bombardment of Charleston

 

during the Civil War helped makeg@ public opin-
lon pro-Spanish. Of the newspapers only the
Daily News supports the insurgents. In

 

 
30
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
concluding his letter of March 29, Moncada lists
a number of ships- several former blockade-run-
ners - which have been acauired by the insur«
gents.

In a letter (March 29, 1869) to the Captain
General of Cuba, Moncada insists that the South
has little sympathy for the Cuban rebels. He
urges the Captain General to employ on Spanish

grujsers the gagtains of former blockade-runners.
n June 12, 1 » Moncada informs Ldpez Roberts

 

 
31

of his belief that the Famny is carrying goods to
the insurgents, although its owner Ferguson
[Thomas Barker Ferguson?], who during the Civil
War established the Charleston defenses and sev-
eral times ran the blockade, insists. that she is

 

going to Havane. Moncada writes on August 30,
1869, that 800 men are gathered in Atlanta, Geor
gia, under the command of T. G. [Sic] "Tiger" An
derson ( Gen. George Thomas "Tige™ Anderson);

 
32
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
they will probably embark for Cuba from a Flor-
ida or a Georgia port.

Two letters from Moncada to Ldpez Roberts

(Sept. 4 and Sept. 18, 1869) relate to offers by
Jordan md Anderson - relayed through Major Ed-

 

ward Willis - to give up their filibustering
activities, apparently in return for a bribe.
On September 25, 1869, the Captain General of
Cuba, Antonio Fernandez y Caballero de Rodas,
boasts to Moncada that Spanish Soldiers can deal

 
33
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
with Jordan and that pecuniary sacrifices are not
necessary. Two days later Ldépez Roberts writes
that Spain will not discuss the proposals of
General Anderson.

In 1870 Jordan's expedition collapsed and the
situation in Cuba appeared favorable to Spain,
but by 1873 filibustering was again causing a-
larm. In letters of August and September, 1873,
Ambassador José Polo de Bernabé urzes Jaime

 

 
34
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
Salvé, consular azent in Charleston, to devote
all his energies to investigating and hindering
the activities of the insurgents and filibuster-
ers. In letters of January 20, 1875, Ambassador
Antonio Mantilla de los Rios and the consul in

 

Baltimore warn consul Juan de Alminana that the
steamer Calvert, suspected of serving the in-
surgents, has left Baltimore for Charleston. On

August 8, 1879,Carlos Pié, consul in Néw Orleans

 
35
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
informs the consul in Charleston, José Alcald
Galiano, that he has learned from secret agents
that the insurgent leader Villegas is to lead an
expedition to Cuba in the Nip King, which will
take on a load of contraband and war material in

 

Charleston. On November 7, 1883, Enrique Dupuy
de Lame, temporarily in charge of the Spanish
embassy, warns Almifana that the Cuban insur-
gents, despite an apparent lull in their activi-

 
36

ties, have not given up their fight against
Spain. Consular officials must exercise con-
stant vigilance.

In letters of April 30, June 14, and June 15,
1895, to Miguel Rubio Arroniz, consul in Charles

 

ton, Dupuy de Léme, now ambassador, urges ener-
getic action to halt insurgent activity. The
consul is instructed to present true accounts of

give bribes to obtain information and to request
the aid of Federal and state officials to pre-
vent the sailing of filibustering expeditions.
On September 20, 1895, Frederick Ancrum Lord,
vice-consul in Wilmington, North Carolina, in-

 

forms Arroniz that the steamer Conqueror has
arrived from New London, Connecticut, loaded
with rifles and cartridges. On September 23
Lord writes that he is certain the Commodore is

in the service of the insurgents; her crew are
seeking to recruit volunteers, offering %1000
immediate payment and $100 per month.

Among the most interesting papers in the col-
lection are those relating to the American Civil

 

War. On November 1, 1860, Garcfda y Tassara in-
forms Moncada that should political complications
follow the presidential election, all Spaniards
must observe strict neutrality. On December 24,

 
39

1860, the ambassador instructs Moncada to coop-
erate with the other consuls in clearing ships
from Charleston. In letters of January 6, 12,
1861, Moncada is warned that he can have no of-
ficial correspondence with South Carolina author

 

ities which might imply diplomatic recognition.
Letters from Garcfa y Tassara to Moncada (April
20, May 2,4, and 13, 1861) relate to Lincoln's

proclamation of a blockade of Confederate ports.

 
40

South Carolina. Charleston.

Several papers concern the capture by Con-
federate privateers of American vessels carrying
Spanish property. The ambassador writes Moncada
on June 24, 1861, informing him that the pri-
vateer Savannah has captured the Joseph, laden
with Cuban sugar belonging to Morales and Com-
pany of Cardenas. There are three copies of
rulings (July 8, 1861) by Judge Andrew Gordon
Magrath that the Joseph be sold at auction.

 

 
41

Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
Letters of August 5, 1861, and November 1, 1861,
refer to capture by the vrivateer Jeff Davis.

During November and December, 1861, there are a
number of letters concerning the Spanish ship
Nuestra Seffora de Regla, seized at Port Royal by

 

 

 

General Thomas West Sherman and charged with
carrying not only Moncada's consular disvatches
but also official Confederate correspondence
addressed to the South's agents in Europe.

 
42
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
Corresvondents in the case of the Nuestra Senora
de Regla include William Henry Trescot (Nov. 5,
1861), James Heyward Trapier (Nove 11, 1861),
Arthur Middleton Manigault (Nov. 16, 1861), and
William Henry Seward (Dec. 10, 1861).

 

 

On the night of January 30, 1863, the small
Confederate fleet forced a temporary withdrawal
of the Union vessels blockading Charleston har-
bor. Included in the collection is a copy of

 
43
Snyain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
the proclamation (Jan. 31, 1863) in which Beau-
regard and Duncan Nathaniel Ingraham announced
the end of the blockade. Ina letter of Febru-
ary 12, 1863, Thomas Jordan of Beauregard's
staff offers to place a vessel at Moncada's dis-
posal and thus allow him to see that the harbor
is no longer effectively blockaded. On February
14, 1863, Jordan informs the consul that on the
previous night three steamers entered the harbor

 

 
4
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
and one left without any interference.

Several papers relate to the efforts in the
sumner of 1863 by General Quincy Adams Gillmore
to reduce the defenses of Charleston. From Jor-
dan, Moncada receives a copy of Gillmore's ulti-

 

matum to Beauregard (Aug. 21, 1863) - either the
Confederates evacuate Morris Island and Fort Sum
ter or Union guns will bombard Charleston. Jor-
dan also sends a copy of Beauregard's reply to

 
45
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate,
South Carolina. Charleston.
Gillmore (Aug. 22, 1863) - a blunt refusal to
evacuate the fortifications and a bitter de-
nunciation of the bombardment of Charleston dur-
ing the previous night.

There are a number of papers related to

 

Spain's naval war with Chile and Peru, 1865-1866
On November 11, 1865, Garcfa y Tassara urges
Bartolomé Riols, consular agent in Charleston
during Moncada‘'s temporary absence, to see that

 
46
Svain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston
ho ships or munitions for Chile enter the harbor.
On February 14, 1866, the ambassador informs Ri-
ols that the Meteor, which was to put to sea as
a Chilean privateer, has been detained in New
York by Federal authorities. Charleston, the
ambassador continues, is a center for Chilean
intrigues. On a letter of May 13, 1866, Garcfa
y Tassara refers to the naval bombardment of
Callao by Mendez Nunez and urges Moncada, now

 

 
4?
Soain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
returned from Syvain, to watch for Chilean and
Peruvian agents. On September 16, 1865, Moncada
is ordered to communicate immediately to Madrid
any information concerning Chilean or Peruvian
privateers.

 

Most of the papers in the collection are of a
routine nature and concern shipping, health con-
ditions, passports, government changes in Spain,
and legal problems encountered by Spaniards in

 
48
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
South Carolina. Of considerable value are the
numerous papers found throughout the collection
relating to commerce between Charleston and the
Spanish islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico. Also
of interest are documents dated September 6,

 

1861, and January 30, January 31, and March 31,
1862, containing lists of ships entering and
leaving Charleston harbor in violation of the
Federal blockade. Following the Civil War, therd

 
49

Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
are a large number of letters addressed to the
Charleston consulate from the vice-consul in
Wilmington, North Carolina; these are related
almost entirely to shinning at that port.

In addition to the loose manuscripts, there

 

are in the collection forty-five volumes, a com-
plete list of which is found in the bound volume
file. Among the volumes are letter books, ship-
ping and passport registers, log books, crew

 
50
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
lists, and an inventory of consular property.
With the possible exception of some of the let-
ter books, the shipping registers are the most
interesting of the volumes. A series of re-
gisters covering the years 1850-1860 and 1871-
1896 contains considerable information on the
nature and value of cargoes entering and leaving
Charleston and on the nationality, type, origin,
and destination of vessels calling at the port.

 

 
51

Of the letter books (copiadores, copias, or
correspondencia), most, including the two earli-
est (Copiador general, 1803-1805, and Correspon-
denci2 general, 1805-1809), relate almost en-
tirely to commercial affairs - arrival and de-

 

 

 

 

 

parture of Spanish ships, prices of goods, tar-
iffs, legal problems of merchants and shippers,
costs of ship repairs, and discipline of Spanish
seamen. On the other hand, the letter books of

 
52
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
the Civil War period, prépared by the vro-Con-
federate consul Francisco Munoz Ramdn de Moncada,
are composed largely of reports of conditions in
wartime Charleston and of news reaching Charles-
ton of political md military events within the

 

Confederacy. Although these volumes are labeled
"Savannah," almost.all the letters are written

from Charleston. The cause of this apparent dis-
crepancy is explained by Moncada's transferral in

 
53
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
the late summer of 1860 from the vice-consulate
in Savannah to the consulate in Charleston.
With him to his new post, Moncada carried copies
of letters he had written since assuming the
Savannah vice-consulship in the previous March.

 

In. the volume. somewhat erroneously titled
Correspondencia con las Ad de Cuba y Puerto
Rico, there is a letter (July 27, 1861) to the
Spanish consul in New York reporting the Union

 
Su
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
defeat at the First Battle of Manassas and prais
ing the valor of the Confederates who are fight-
ing in the sacred defense of their homes and
their independence. On August 5, 1861, Moncada
reports rumors of a Union defeat in Missouri; in
another letter of the same day he describes his
efforts to obtain the release of Spanish property
seized by the privateer Jefferson Davis from the
American ship John Welch. On August 8, 1861,

 

 

 

 
55

Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
Moncada informs the consul in Livervool of the
Confederate Congress's decision to abide by the
declaration of the Congress of Paris (1856)
abolishing privateering.

In the volume entitled Corresvondencia oficial

 

 

con la embajada en Washington (1861), Moncada
reports on October 12, 1001, that the Confeder-
ate steamer Theodora, previously known as the
Gordon, has run the blockade and is carrying the

 

 
56
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
Confederate commissioners John Slidell and James
M. Mason toward Havana. On the same day he in-
forms Garcfa y Tassara of the Confederate attack
on Santa Rosa Island, near Pensacola, Florida
(Oct. 9). Ina long letter of December 28, 1861,
he refutes the charges made against him in the
case of Nuestra Senora de Regla. Moncada gives
a further vindication of his conduct in a letter
of January 20, 1862 (Correspondencia oficial con

 

 

 

 
57
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.

ia embajada en Washington, 1862-1863). Ina
very interesting letter of November 7, 1862,
found in Correspondencia oficial (1862-1863),
Moncada informs the ambassador that he has learn

ed from the English consul in Charleston that

 

 

the Confederate Government has discovered French
intriques urging the state of Texas to declare
itself independent. and offering to the Texans aid
and protection. The councillor of the French

 
58
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
consulate in Richmond and the French consular
agent in Galveston have been expelled from the
Confederacy. From William Henry Trescot, Mon-
cada has learned that similar intrigues occurred
during the Buchanan administration.

 

There are several interesting letters in the
volume entitled Correspondencia oficial con la
Primera Secretaria de Estado, 1861 (Jan.-Sept.).
On January 1, 1861, Moncada informs the Ministry

 

 

 
59
Spain. Ministry of Foreieon Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
of Foreign Affairs that anarchy reigns in Wash-
ington where General Winfield Scott is the act-
ual ruler. Charleston is filled with troops;
lights have been removed from the harbor. On
March 8, 1861, Moncada writes that the French
consul has received secret orders to legalize the
documents of all ships under any flag, including
Confederate, going to France. Moncada believes
that France will recognize the new nation as

 

 
60
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
soon as the Confederate commissioners reach Eu-
rope. On April 12 Moncada refutes the rumor
that a Northern fleet is zoing to Santo Domingo
to halt the Spanish advance there. The annexa-
tion of Santo Domingo by Spain is being applaud-
ed by the Charleston press. On April 13 Moncada
gives a good description of the attack on Fort
Sumter. On June 24 and July 27 he speaks of the
spirit of hatred and vengeance felt by Charles-

 

 
61

Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
tonians for the North. Letters of August 8 and
August 16 refer to the Confederate decision to
abide in part by the declaration of the Congress
of Paris (1856) regarding privateering.

In a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

 

dated August 17, 1861, Moncada describes a Con-
federate victory at Lovettsville, Virginia, on

August 13-14, and mentions rumors of a Confeder-
ate victory in Missouri in which the Union Gen-

 
62
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
eral Nathaniel Lyon was killed (Wilson's Creek,
Aug. 10). On August 31, 1861, Moncada describes
the Union attack md capture of Fort Hatteras,
North Carolina. On September 10 he remarks on
the ineffectiveness of the Charleston blockade.

 

In the volume Corresvondencia oficial con la
Primera Secretaria de Estado, 1961 (Sept.-Dec.),
there is a letter of September 29, 1861, in
which Moncada urges Spain to adopt a "noble,

 

 

 
63
Spain. Ministry of. Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
frank, and decided course" in regard to the Am-
erican question and thus regain political in-
fluence in the Western hemisphere. On the same
day he sends the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a
list of ships running the blockade around North

 

and South Carolina and Georgia ports and declares
that the blockade is totally ineffective. A
letter of October 25 decribes the Confederate
victory at Ball's Bluff. In a long letter

{

 
64
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
of October 28, 1861, Moncada reveals his sympa-
thies for the Confederate cause; the Southern
armies, maintains the consul, are composed of
citizens fighting in just defense of their homes
and independence, while the Northern forces are

 

composed of foreigners and hirelings. Ina let-
ter of November 11 he informs the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the Union capture of Hilton
Head and Edding Island and then discusses the

 
65
Svain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
flight of Charleston citizens, the strengthening
of the city's defenses, and the fear of a slave
uprising.

Moncada's communications with the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs are continued in Correspondencia
oficial con la Primera Secretaria de Estado
(1862). On March 5, 1862, the consul describes
the strengthening of the Charleston defenses.

On May 7 he writes that the Confederate steamer

 

 

 

 

 
66
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
Nashville has run the blockade at Beaufort,
North Carolina, bringing from Liverpool supplies
and munitions worth 2,000,000 pesos. On the
same day he writes that he has refused to permit
Southern-owned ships to be placed under Spanish
registry. On May 9 he writes that he has joined
the British and French consuls in protesting the
Confederate reguirement that all men between the
ages of 18-45, regardless of nationality, must

 

 
67
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.
bear arms. The Federal cavture of New Bern,
North Carolina, is described in a letter of Mare
23. In a letter of June 12, Moncada describes
the Federal bombardment and landings on James
Island; he has learned that Charleston, now near

 

ly deserted except for Negroes and poor Irishmen
will not be evacuated or surrendered. A letter
of June 25, 1862, gives a good account of the
Union attack and repulse at James Island (June

 
68

Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consulate.
South Carolina. Charleston.

16). On July 13 Moncada sends a list of steamers
which have recently run the Charleston blockade;
on July 14 he briefly describes the Seven Days‘
Battles (June 26-July 1, 1862). On November 26,
1862, Moncada tells of the convening of the Sout
Carolina legislature, the opposition by the gov-
ernor of Georgia to the Confederate conscription
law, and the support of the law by the governor

of Florida.

The letter books contain copies of very few
letters written after 1862. There is, however,
one letter of considerable interest found in
Correspondencia oficial con el Gobernador Capit

 

 

General de la Isla de Cuba, 1861-1363 (p. 23).

On August | a 1863, M Moncada writes to the Union
general Quincy Adams Gillmore protesting Gill-
more's threat to bombard Charleston unless Fort
Sumter and Morris Island are surrendered by Beau

regard within four hours.

The letter books of the post-Civil War period
are devoted almost entirely to routine commer-
cial matters and, surprisingly, contain virtuall
no references to the Cuban question.

This collection consists almost entirely of
communications directed to the Spanish vice-
consulate in Savannah,Georgia, by the Madrid
Government, by the Spanish ministers, consuls,
and vice-consuls in the United States, and by

governing officials in Puerto Rico and Cuba.
It has been impossible to determine exactly

when various individuals assumed the post of

vice-consul of Spain in Savannah. Therefore,

fears that American or Cuban expeditions, opers«

ating from the United States, would wrest the
island from the Spanish crown. Numerous com-
munications in the 1830's instruct the vice-
consul to prevent the departure for Cuba of any
individual without a valid passport. It is not,
however, until the late 1840's that Spanish
officials begin to show great concern over the
Cuban revolutionary tendencies. On January 27,
1849, the Spanish ambassador, Angel Calderon
de la Barca, instructs the vice-consul to warn

 

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 5
Consulate. Georgia. Savannah.

travellers that anyone carrying prohibited news-
papers into Cuba would be severely vunished. On
August 14, 1849, he speaks gratefully of Presi-
dent Zachary Taylor's proclamation prohibiting
the fitting out within the United States of ex-
peditions against Cuba. The ambassador writes

 

on September 13, 1849, that all consuls and
vice-consuls should immediately inform the Cap-
tain General of Cuba.about any hostile actions
being prepared against Spanish territory. In

a note attached to a letter of January li, 18504
Calderon de la Barca. states that he has learned
that in Savannah there are a number of persons
who pretend to be going to Colombia or Califor-
nia but in reality are planning a new expeditio
against Cuba; the vice-consul is ordered to keex

 

the Captain General fully informed. On Septem-
ber 4, 1850, the Spanish legation in Washington
sends to the vice-consul a circular letter is-
sued by Daniel Webster, Secretary of State,

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 7
Consulate. Georgia. Savannah.

ordering all marshals, district attorneys, and
port collectors to enforce America's neutrality
laws. Calderon de la Barca writes on September
13, 1850, that he has learned that a new ex-
pedition against Cuba is being organized in
Charleston and Mobile. In a letter of April 20,

 

1851, José Gutierrez de la Concha, Governor of
Cuba, writes that he expects another invasion
by "pirates" but that there is no cause for a-
larn.

Calderon de la Barea was recalled to Spain

Consulate. Georgia. Savannah.

in August, 1553; José Marfa Mazallon temporarily
assumed control of the legation as chargé’
d’affaires. On September 7, 1853, Magallon in-
strueted the vice-consul in Savannah to write
not only the legation and the Captain General
of Cuba,concerning conspiracies against Spanish
rule, but also to communicate directly with the
Madrid Government and the Minister Plenipoten-
tiary in London. Magallon reports on March 22,
1854 that the queen, Isabel II, has decided to

 

 

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 9
Consulate. Georzia. Savannah.

grant amnesty to all Cubans who have partici-
pated in rebellions or invasions; the vice-con-
sul is authorized to grant passports to Cuba to
all who promise to live peacefully.

During his short term as Governor of Cuba
(Dec. 3, 1853-Sept. 21, 1854), Lt Gen. Juan de
la Pezuela, Marqués de la Pezuela, manifested
considerable concern over conspiracies seeking
to free Cuba from Spanish rule. In letters of
June 20, 1854, and July’7, 1854, Pezuela writes

 

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Viee- 10
Consulate. Georgia. Savannah.

that he has received reports that "la Estrella
Solitaria} a conspiratorial group, has been
holding meetings in Savannah, In letters of
July 20, 1854, and August 21, 1854, he laments
that, despite a recent Presidential message,
the people of Savannah view with complete in-

 

difference the plans for invading Cub2. On
August 6, 1854, Pezuela thanks the vice-consul
for informing him of the departure for Savannah
of Quitman, apparently John Anthony Quitman,

Mississippi governor and congressman who was in
dicted for violation of American neutrality
laws.

An interesting letter dated May 26, 1854,
from A. M. Segovia, Spanish consul in New Or-
leans, reports that forces are massing in that

 

city for an invasion of Cuba. Segovia suggests
that the consulates in New Orleans and Savannah
correspond regularly and that in order to pre-
vent interception of messages, writing should

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 12
Consulate. Georzia. Savannah.
be in code and telegrams Should be sent not to
the consulates but to trustworthy persons in the
city. Ina letter of June 6, 1854, Segovia
states that the filibusters in New Orleans are
reserved and cautious; he expresses the opinion
that differences exist between the American and
Cuban elements.

Leopoldo Augusto de Cueto presented his
credentials as ambassador extraordinary to Pres
ident Pierce on May 30, 1854. Ina letter of

the same date he points out that his biggest
problem is Cuba and that his chief task is to
influence public opinion in the United States.
On June 20, 1854, Cueto thanks the vice-consul
for sending information concerning the activi-
ties of "la Estrella Solitaria" in Savannah.

 

On July 8, 1854, he acknowledges receipt of a
report that Savannah is quiet and that MacfYas
and Fernandez, two revolutionaries, have left.
In a twelve-page letter of July 21 Cueto in-

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 14
Consulate. Georgia. Savannah.

structs the vice-consul to continue investiga-
ting the steamer Gordon if he thinks it has been
purchased by conspirators; he is instructed to
enlist the support of local, state, and federal
authorities in carrying out the investigation.
In a letter of July 28, 1854, the ambassador
acknowledges receipt of a report that Quitman
has turned over the filibustering business to an
unknown American and to Macfas, who is thought
to be in New Orleans. On August 24, 1854, he

 

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreion Affairs. Vice- 15
Consulate. Georgia. Savannah.

expresses happiness on learning of the dis-
couragement among the rebels.

Throughout the early part of 1855 the commun-
ications addressed to the Savannah vice-consu-
late by Cueto and Concha, now serving his sec-
ond term as Governor of Cuba, are filled with

 

references to filibustering expeditions against
the island. On February 4, ina private letter
to the vice-consul, Cueto writes that the con-
spirators, led by Quitman, plan to embark from

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 16
Consulate. Georgia. Savannah.

New York, Savannah, and Charleston in four
steamers and four sailing ships and to pick up
arms farther south. On February 10 Concha
gives additional information. The expedition,
consisting of 3,000 men, had long been planned
but had been postponed, awaiting the outcome of

 

the Soulé question. Quitman is the leader of
the expedition and of the Cuban Junta. The in-
vaders possess four steamers, including the
Black Warrior, and six sailing ships and plan

 

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 17
Consulate. Georzia, Savannah.

to embark as passengers from New York, Charles-
ton, Savannah, and Galveston. Already the fi-
nancial obligations of the conspirators are
enormous. To frustrate the expedition would be
a great triumph; Concha feels himself prepared.
On March 2 he writes that news from New York in-
dicates that the filibusters have suffered
grave disappointments. The Massachusetts has
been placed under embargo. The United States,
however, has left for Mobile carrying Cuban

 

 

 

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 18
Consulate. Georgia. Savannah.

immigrants. A letter of June 9, 185%, from
Cueto indicates that perhaps Spanish fears are
exaggerated; recent trials in New York and Phil
adelphia, reports the ambassador, show that the
Kinney expedition was not directed against Cuba
but against Central. America. However, fear of
invasion remained, and on November 30, 1859,
Ambassador Gabriel Garcfa y Tassara writes that
he is afraid that William Walker, unable to go
to Nicaragua, might try to lead an expedition
against Cuba in December.

 

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 19
Consulate. Georgia. Savannah.

Not until after the American Civil War do
the papers contain any further informative re-
ferences to Cuba. On October 11, 1866, Garcfa
y Tassara speaks of an article in the New York
Herald concerning the "Knights of Arabia! a
group allegedly numbering 20,000 which was

 

planning to seize and divide Spanish territory.
On November 7, 1866, Garcfa y Tassara writes

that he has reason to believe that a conspiracy
against Cuba is being organized in New York and

other Northern ports; he does not know the re-
lationship of this conspiracy with those in the
South.

Mauricio Lépez Roberts is named ambassador to
Washington in March, 1869. On March 20 he re-
ports to the Savannah vice-consulate that the

 

American government has promised to order its
officials to protect American neutrality. In
this letter and one of March 27 he urges con-
stant vigilance against filibusters.

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 21

In the papers of the 1870's little mention
is made of Cuba; however, throughout the 1880's
the Cuban problem claimed the attention of
Spain's representatives in the United States.
On November 7, 1883, Enrique Dupuy de Léiie
writes from Washington that Cuban insurgents

 

have not abandoned hope and that their present
goal is to provoke Spanish repression and thus
win American sympathies. On May 2, 1884, Am-
bassador Juan Valera expresses regret that the

legation lacks the necessary funds to hire full-
time detectives to investigate the anti-Spanish
activities within the United States. Unfortu-
nately, he continues, the ordinary spies gener-
ally serve only to invent news and create alarm.
On November 8, 1884, Valera gives permission to
the vice-consul to hire a detective to keep
watch on the Cuban Moinelo, who allegedly was
planning an expedition. Im a letter of April
27, 1836, newly appointed ambassador Muruaga

criticized — recent speech by "el senador Frey"
[Senator William Pierce Frye] in which this
Republican leader called on the Latin American
states to forget their ties with Spain and to
recognize the leadership of the United States.
On September 29, 1895, Pedro Solis, consul in
Tampa, reports that he has received information
that Cuban revolutionists have stored large
quantities of arms and munitions on Hutchinson's
Island near the city of Jacksonville.

A large number of letters relating to Cuba
deal with routine questions, customs duties
shipping regulations, and the issuing of pass-
ports and health certificates to all Us Si resi
dents wishing to travel to Cuba.

The collection contains a number of refer-

 

ences to political developments within Spain.
In addition to routine announcements of fre-
quent cabinet changes, there are several com-
munications referring to the outstanding poli-

tical events of Spain's troubled nineteenth

century. A l€tter (November 30, 1836) from
Pablo Chacon, consul general in Philadephia,

announces that the Queen Regent (Maria Cristina
de Borbdén) has sworn allegiance to the liberal
Constitution of 1812. Subsequent letters from

 

Chacon (January 6, April 22, and September 12,
1337) deal with the requirements that all Span-
ish subjects take an oath to support the con-
stitution and the monarchy. Ina letter of

October 18, 1341, Antonio Gonzalez y Gonzalez,
Spanish premier, orders the viee-consul to in-
form all shippers that the coast of Cantabria
is under blockade. On October 6, 1868, Facun-
do Gofii, ambassador in Washington (1867-1869),
speaks of the revolution raging in Spain and
calls on Spaniards abroad to uphold “espano-
lismo." In a letter of January 2, 1871, Lépez
Roberts forwards information he has received
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs des-

cribing the enthusiastic reception accorded King
Amadeo by the Madrid Populace.

Several interesting items relate to Spain's
‘little-known naval war with Chile and Peru in
1865-1866. On November 11, 1865, Garcia y
Tassara speaks of the "recent news from Chile"

 

and urges the vice-consul to observe carefully
in order to learn if arms and ships are being
gathered in the United States by Chilean agents.
The ambassador writes on February 4, 1866, that

 
Spain. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Vice- 27
Consulate. Georgia. Savannah.

U. S. authorities haved seized the Chilean
privateer Meteor in New York. On February 28
he expresses the belief that perhaps a Chilean
vessel has entered the Savannah harbor. On
May 13, 1866, he urges continued vigilance a-
gainst Chilean and Peruvian agents and speaks
of "what has just happened in the Pacific"-
obviously a reference to the bold but reckless
naval bombardment of Callao by the Spanish ad-
miral Mendez Nunez on May 2, 1866. On July 10,

1866, Garcia y Tassara reports that a new in-

surrection in Cuba is possibly being aided by
Chilean agents.

Among other letters of some interest are
several relating to the American Civil War. On
January 4, 1861, Garcia y Tassara writes that
in the event that Georgia secedes from the U-"

 

nion, the vice-consul is to warn all Spaniards

that those who become involved in the internal

affairs of the United States can expect no help
from Spanish consulates or from the legation.

Lyman Greenleafe Spalding was born Jan. 1,
1845, the son of Susan Parker (Parrott) and Ly-
man: D. Spalding, a prominent businessman of
Portsmouth, N. H. His uncle was Enoch Green-
leafe Parrott, rear admiral of the U. S. Navy.

The collection consists of letters written by
Lyman G. Spalding to his brothers, sisters, and
parents throughout the twenty years he spent in

the navy.

 
Spalding, Lyman Greenleafe 2
The™correspondence starts in Oct., 1861,
when Spalding began his naval life as a clerk

to his uncle aboard the U. S. S. Augusta.

For nearly a year he saw active duty in the
Civil War, participating in the Battle of Port
Royal, S. C., the capture of several vessels

 

which tried to run the Union blockade, and the
blockade of Charleston, S. C. An ardent Union-
ist at the beginning of the conflict, his feel-

ings changed markedly as the destructive war
continued. In Oct., 1862, he entered the U. S.

 
Spalding, Lyman Greenleafe 3

 

Naval Academy, then in Newport, R. 1. The
letters over the following four years give a
detailed, if repetitive, description of the
life of a naval student. Graduating in the
summer of 1866, he failed to receive his com-
mission because of a chronic ear ailment. For

the next four years, there are relatively few
letters, since Spalding spent most of his time
in Portsmouth and Boston. He worked as an en-
gineer in 1870 for a railroad construction com-
pany, and he was reinstated in the navy in

 
 

Spacing, Lyman Greenleafe __ 4
. Spalding joined the Asiatic Squadron

for a three-year cruise in 1872, and the let-
ters of this period are very interesting. He
gives detailed descriptions of ports of call in
China, Japan, Egypt, Aden, Zanzibar, Singapore,
Java, Borneo, and Sumatra. He comments on the

people, scenery, customs, and politics of all
these places. Plagued by a severe case of
rheumatism, Spalding spent several months in
the naval hospital in Yokohama, Japan, and was
eventually sent home in 1875 to recuperate.

 
Spalding, Lyman Greenleafe 5
From then onward the letters become less fre-
quent. He apparently took part in a coastal
survey around New Orleans, and went on another
long cruise to the Orient in the late 1870's.
He was killed in an accident while assisting
in an experiment with torpedoes, Aug. 9, 1881.

 

The correspondence is predominantly descrip-
tive in nature, telling about sights, activi-
ties, and interests of Spalding. A great mu-
sic lover, he often wrote about the operas or
musicales he attended or the singing groups he

 
Spalding, Lyman Greenleafe 6
participated in. He occasionally mentions poli-
tics, foreign affairs, and society in general.
The remainder of the collection consists of

a few financial papers, an account of Spalding's
death, and a picture of him taken in 1876.

tion of papers for Spalding's uncle, Admiral

This collection consists primarily of the
letters and lecture notes of Matthias Spalding
of Amherst, New Hampshire, who was in London
several months during the years 1801-1802.
Spalding was very active in vaccination and ser-
ved more than once as president of the New

Hampshire Medical Society. °

The first item in the collection is a letter
written by Edward Augustus Holyoke on April 21,
1801, requesting Spalding to procure some drugs
for him. In October, 1801, Dr. Benjamin Water-

 
Spalding, Matthias, is:

house writes a letter to Spalding, a former stu-
dent of his, in which he says that more can be
learned in one week in London than in America
during twenty. He also notes that there is as
much to learn from great men as from books. He
comments on the methods of inoculation that are
being used by William Aspinwall1(1743-1823), and

 

urges Spalding to send him more vaccine at any
and every opportunity. In a second letter (April
15, 1802) from Waterhouse, he comments on the
inoculation of sone Indian warriors in Washfngto
D. C.; on Aspinwall and his hospital; on politi-

 
Spalding, Matthias, 23.
cal affairs; and on a measle epidemic. He men-
tions that he is sending a dissertation on Natu-
ral History which is to be included in a volume
then at press,

In an undated letter written just prior to
Spalding's return to America, Edward Jenner
apologizes for not having the parcel of vaccine
matter ready for Dr. Waterhouse earlier and tells
of his incessant interruptions and harassingkind
of life.

There are a series of notes on lectures whic
were delivered at St. Thomas' Hospital and Guy's

 

 
Spalding, Matthias, 4
Hospital by William Babington (1756-1833); Henry
Cline (1750-1827); Astley Paston Cooper (1768-
1841); John Haighton (1755-1823); and one Mr. Fox,
They are concerned with anatomy, physiology,
Surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, chemistry,
pharmacology, and pathology.

 

The commonplace book, May 15, 1801-September
26, 1802, is composed mainly of a journal which
Spalding kept during his Stay in London, In
addition to mentioning several famous English
physicians, Spalding comments on his visits to
various London hospitals and churches, to the

Royal Academy of Arts, the Tower of London, the
House of Commons, Drewry Lane Theater, the monas
tery at Lullworth, Oxford and Cambridge univer-
sities, and other scenic places in London and itg
environs. The book also contains a record of
his private expenses in London, expenses for his

lectures at St. Thomas' and Guy's Hospitals, and

On Aug. 1, 1828, Samuel P. Spalding delivered
a panegyric on Andrew Jackson and his candidacy
for President in that year. Spalding's
criticism of Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams
is caustic, while he described Jackson as the

saviour of his country. Adams and Clay were
charged with personal corruption and political
chicanery. Jackson was viewed as a leader whose
personal integrity and military experience
qualified him for the task of restoring

 
Spalding, Samuel P. 2
America's greatness.

The address was delivered at St. Mary's
Seminary, a Catholic school for girls in
Springfield. A note intended for insertion in
the speech indicates that Spalding's audience
would probably have been an appreciative one.

Thomas Spalding (1774-1851), in whose honor
Spalding ©. was named, was born at Frederica,
St. Simon's Island, Glynn Co., Ga. on Mer. 26,
1774. H&E began the study of law in the office
of Thomas Gibbons of Savannah, but his large

 

estate required so much of his personal atten-
tion that he abandoned the law. He was a
state legislator and representative to the
Ninth Congress. He visited Europe with his
family and spent two years in London. At the
close of the War of 1812 he was sent to Ber-

 
Spalding, Thomas. 2
mude to negotiate relative to slaves and other
property taken from the South by the British
troops. In 1826 he was appointed commissioner
Onnthe part of the state to settle the boundary
line between Gg. and Fla. In 1850, although in
ill health, he attended the convention in Mill-

 

edgeville to consider the compromise measures
which had been introduced in Gongress. He died
on Jon. 4, 1851.

An excellent letter from Henry 38. Spaulding
of the 42nd Illinois Volunteers at Benton Bar-
racks, St.Louis, Mo., comments in April, 1862,
on the war in the West. A soldier in General
John Pope's command, he believes the most

admirable generalship shown in the war was that
of Pope and Commander Foote at New Madrid and
Island Ten. Referring to the return of Union
wounded from Pittsburg Landing, he reviewed
Federal hospitals, those in St, Louis in par-
ticular, He commented 20 yy. 8, Grant as a

 
Spaulding, Henry Sr?

general and on the characters of Generals Wn.
T. Sherman and Stephen Augustus Hurlbut. The
surprise and the battle at Pittsburg Landing
are analyzed. He mentions General Henry
Halleck's departure from command at Washington,
Pp. G.

 

On, Sept. 10, 1864, "Jas.," a ministerial
student with conscientious scruples about fight-
ing, writes to Mrs. Spauldingc?, from Rock
Island Barracks, where he has spent the summer
vacation working with "rebel" prisoners.

Falls, Niagara Co., N.Y.

Here are four letters of Ira Spaulding
(d. 1875) to a home-town friend, John Dunklee
(proprietor of the Clifton Hotel at Niagara
Falls, N.Y.), and a typed copy of one letter
sent to Mrs. Dunklee. The other two items are
the officiel countersigns for April 3 and 20,

 

1863, as ordered by Generals Joseph Hooker and
Henry W. Bennam of the Army of the Potomac near
Falmouth, Va.

Spaulding was a captain in the Fiftieth Reg-

 
Spaulding, Ira z
iment of Engineers, having enlisted for three
years at Niagara Falls, N.Y.,on Aug. 5, 1861.

He was then 43 years of age. His promotions
were: major, October, 1862; lieutenant colonel,
ee 1863; and brig. gen. by brevet, April 9,
1865.

Spaulding's letters show him as a hard-work-
ing, conscientious, and capable officer, under-
taking duties of considerable importance to
Union troop movements during the Eastern cam-
paigns of 1862-1863. His main resvonsibility

 

 
Spaulding, Ira 3
is to supervise the building, dismantling, and
moving of pontoon bridges, beginning with
McClellan's Peninsular Campaign (March-July,
13862). During this time Spaulding's bridges
across the Chickahominy River and later White
Oak Swamp Creek are the crossing points of most
of the Federal forces. Spaulding was flattered
by the compliment that during the White Oak
Swamp affair his bridges “had been the salvation
of the army." He gives an interesting account
of this battle, remarking on the "splendid

 

 
Spaulding, Ira 4
courage of the rebels...in the face of a most
murderous fire...I don't know but I cheered

them at each charge...." In spite of his admir-
ation for the fighting qualities of the Confed-
erate soldier, Spaulding leaves no doubt as to
his political sympathies.

Spaulding's letters reflect a great deal of
ovotimism and enthusiasm, the "utmost confidence"
in the generalship of ‘the Army (Aug. 16, 1862),
and a good-natured acceptance of the hardships
accompanying night marches, surprise orders,

 

 
Spaulding, Ira 5
camp life, etc. His only "gripes" are against
army sulters with their poor-quality whiskey,
(at three dollars a quart).

After the Peninsular Campaign, the 50th
Engineers continue to build bridges, with
Spaulding otherwise drilling and instructing his
men, or inspecting fortifications. Bridges are
built across the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers
through 1863. His last letter ends with an
optimistic faith in the ultimate success of the

Union Army.

“The writers of the letters of this small
collection are primarily members of a large
family group, living in relatively close
proximity to each other in the state of Va.

In the early letters, coming in the middle
years of the 1850's, we learn of the unsuccess-
ful wooing of James D. Still for the hand of
Miss Olivia Patterson. She herself writes very
few of the letters but receives them from all
a@irections, even some, near the end of the
century addressed as "dearest Grandma." Ina

 

 
 

Spencer, Olivia E. 2
letter of July 7,, 1501, we learn that she is

married to . Spencer, This letter is
written by her brother George B. Pattexson;

and for the next four years the focus of inter-
est centers on his reports coming from the
various camps and battlefields in his career
as a soldier in the 2lst Regiment of Virginia

Infantry. His brother William Henry PatteNMson
also sends occasional letters to his sister
Olivia. But he, for most of the War, is in the
same company with his brother.

In the experiences of George B., we have

 
Spencer, Olivia E. ts)
a typical case of the inexperienced rural
Virginia boy as he leaves his home for the firs
time, While still in a training camp (July 29,
1861) just worth of Norfolk, he shows restless-
ness and youthful eagerness to get started.
Later in Sept., he learns of nearby skirmishes
and the death of a boy from his neighborhood

 

while carrying the standard of his company,
with a decided sobering effect on George. But
soon (Dec. 28, 1861) he reports from Winchester
his first impressions of the grand panoramic
landscape of the Shenandoah Valley, genuinely

 
Spencer, Olivia E. 4
and ldyllically proud that he is a Virginian.
About a year later (Sept. 29, 1862) from Camp
Bunker Hill he gives details of a fierce but
victorious battle and is very grateful that
both he and his brother escaped uninjured.
During the year 1865 and the early months of
1864 he reports relatively little of dangerous
participation in serious engagements in North-
ern Virginia, although (Feb. 4, 1864) he asks
his mother to send him some greenback money so
he can at least buy stamps to send her a letter.
However, in the closing months of 1864

 

 
Spencer, Olivia E. 5
things take on a more serious turn for hin.

On Dec, 16 he reports having arrived in camp
near Petersburg; and he says he doesn't "like
it here at all." Evidently his entire brigade,
if not the entire division, had been sent there
in support of General Lee in his last stand
against the encroachments of Grant!s forces.

 

On Mar. 16, 1866 he reports that they are near
enough in their breastworks to talk to the
Yankees, But about two weeks later, from his
camp entrenchment, he reports that he has just
gone through the fiercest encounter of his

 
Spencer, Olivia E. 6
entire career, He had received orders to
launch a charge at daybreak. Calling on his
company to drive the Yankees from the soil of
Virginia, he had them fire 44 times before he
gave the call for them to retreat at eight
o'clock, The Confederate casualties were num=
erous, but they held their ground and he him-
self escaped uninjured.

While reading all these letters, especially
those by the Pattey¥son boys, from the very
beginning to the last charge at Petersburg,
one is aware, not only of their conviction

 

 
Spencer, Olivia E. 7
of the righteousness of their cause, but also
of the unshaken belief in their ultimate
victory. Even less than a month befat® Lee's
surrender at Appomattox, upon arriving at
Petersburg, George —— seems to fear
they might have another bad season in the

 

damp atmosphere of the "crater," caused

previously by the Federals, before final vic-
tory would come.

Although mumerous letters in this collect-
ion extend for more than a generation beyond
the period of the Civil War, they come from

 
Spencer, Olivia E. 8
a widely scattered relationship, and contain
little more than things of purely personal or
local interest. One might find some additional
genealogical information in a few letters
ranging in time from 1902-1911. Among the
names of correspondents, besides those mention-
ed above, the following might be added: John

William Arnold Spicer (1845-1913) from Prov-
idence, Rhode Island, as a young man, was one of
the spectators at the ceremonial reraising of
the United States flag over Fort Sumter on April

14, 1865. Spicer made the trip from New York
to Charleston as a member of the Plymouth Churc
Excursion. Most of the people on the excursion
were members of the congregation of Henry Ward
Beecher, who was to be the principal speaker at
the ceremonies at Sumter. Events from the trip

 
Spicer, William Arnold 2
and Spicer’s stay in Charleston were recorded in
a two-volume diary kept especially for this ex-
cursion, and twenty years later this diary was
the basis for The Flag Replaced on Sumter, a
paper presented before the Rhode Island Soldiers
and Sailors Historical Society by Spicer in 1884
and then published by the Providence Press Com-

 

 

pany in 1885. Spicer also published two other
works -- Fort Sumter Memorial: The Fall of Fort
Sumter and History of the Ninth and Tenth Regi-
ments of Rhode Island Volunteers,

 

 

 

 

 
Spicer, William Arnold 3
The collection consists of the two-volume
diary which Spicer kept on his trip to Charles-
ton and the monograph The Flag Replaced on Sunm-

ter, which is based on the diary. The diary
contains entries from April 10 to April 20, 1865
The events recorded therein are in chronological
order from Spicer's arrival in New York from
Providence to board the steamer Oceanus for the
trip to Charleston to his arrival back in New
York from Charleston. However, the dates of
entry are not all in chronological order. Also,
the date of entry under which an event is

 

 

 
Spicer, William Arnold 4
recorded is almost always two or three days
after the event, possibly indicating that Spicer
was so busy on this journey that he did not have
time to sit down and write every evening about
what happened that day. Indeed, most of the
events are recorded under dates after April 16,
when the homeward voyage had begun and time was
more available.

While Spicer was in New York waiting to board
ship for the southward voyage, the news of Lee's
surrender was received, and the diary contains
a description of the city' s reaction to this

 

 
Spicer, William Arnold ee 5
news as well as his own. In Charleston, Spicer
saw Fort Sumter, much of the city, and a little
of the country around it. The diary contains
descriptions of Charleston harbor and the vari-
ous fortifications around it and the widespread
devastation suffered by the city during the
siege that had just recently ended. Spicer also
has a description of the ceremonies at Fort
Sumter on April 14, and the reaction of the
Union forces stationed around the harbor to the
sight of the United States flag again flying
over the fort. Spicer remained in Charleston

 

 
Spicer, William Arnold 6
one more day, during which he spent most of his
time souvenir hunting amid the shattered build-
ings of the downtown area. Also, he saw a mass
meeting of the Negroes of the city being ad-
dressed by Henry Ward Beecher, Henry Wilson, and
other prominent Northern abolitionists, and, the
diary has a description of this event. Also in

 

the diary are several encounters that Spicer pe
sonally had with the Negroes of Charleston. On
the voyage back to New York, the Oceanus stopped
at Fortress Monroe, where the passengers learned
of the assassination of Lincoln. Spicer records

 
Spicer, William Arnold 7
the reactions of his fellow passengers to this
news, along with a description of the fortress
in mourning.

The Flag Replaced on Sumter is based primar-
ily on the diary and so has all of the informa-
tion given above. However, there are some addi-
tions to the diary account, At the beginning of
the monograph, Spicer gives the historical back-
ground of the outbreak of war, the fall of Fort
Sumter to the Confederate forces in 1861, and
its recapture by Union troops in February, 1865.

 

 

 
Spicer, William Arnold 8
The recapture of the fort resulted in the order
from President Lincoln for the ceremonial re-
raising of the flag on the fourth anniversary of
its fall. Another place where Spicer has added
material beyond what is in the diary is at the
ceremony itself. This new material is probably
based on the program of the ceremony, as he

 

states in the eg | that he was bringing a pro-
e

gram home so that did not have to record the
ceremony in detail. At the conclusion of the

work, Spicer again leaves the diary to look at

 
Spicer, William Arnold 9

America in 1884 to see what has been done for
the Negro since the war and to offer his advice
on the problem. In appendices at the end of the
monograph are a copy of the words and music to
the song "Victory at Last," sung at the Sumter
ceremonies, and excerpts from the Charleston
Mercury of the dates one month, one week, and
one day before the fall of the city to Union
troops, showing the desperate condition of the
eity.

Robert E. Spiller, educator and literary
historian, was born in Philadelphia, Pa., Nov.
13, 1896. His father who was studying at the
Medical School at the University of Pennsylvania
was William G. Spiller and his mother was Helen
Constance (Newbold) Spiller. Naturally Robert,
like his father, attended the University of
Pennsylvania receiving his B.A. degree in 1917.
He briefly taught school in Baltimore, Maryland,
before enlisting in the University of Pennsyl-

 
Spiller, Robert Ernest

 

vania Base Hospital #20. He spent a year in
Southern France "pounding a typewriter in the
Headquarters office." Returning from service
he became a Harrison Fellow at Penn and re-
ceived his M.A. degree in 1921. During the
year 1920-1921 he was an Instructor at the
University. He continued to study and in 1924
was awarded his Ph.D. He began his college
teaching career at Swarthmore College in 1921
and continued there until 1945 when he became
Professor of English at the University of Penn-

sylvania replacing Professor Arthur Hobson Quin

 
Spiller, Robert Ernest

 

who was retiring. Spiller had studied under
Quinn as a graduate student.

At Swarthmore Spiller had very little oppor-
tunity to teach American subjects, however, he
was one of those who helped to form the Ameri-
can Literature Group of the Modern Language

Association and was a member of the Publication
Committee which pursued the negotiations that
established the American Literature journal as
the official publication of the Group in 1928.
He served for many years on the Advisory and
Editorial Boards. @

 

 
Spiller, Robert Ernest

 

On the faculty at the University of Pennsyl-
vania Spiller found himself becoming involved
more and more in studies of American Civiliza-
tion. He became convinced "that the culture
of which [he] was a part must be drawn into a
fuller realization that it too has a unique

identity. In this way [his] professional life
became focused first on the study of American
literature and then on the larger configuration
of American civilization and culture." Asa
result of these convictions Spiller was instru-
mental in founding a Y association for

 
Spiller, Robert Ernest 5

 

American Studies which has since expanded into
many regional associations as well as into an
international one. During 1951-1970, Spiller
was chairman of the editorial board of the

American Quarterly, the publication of the Amer
ican Studies Association.

 

Early in his tenure at Penn Spiller became
involved in exchange programs under the Rocke-
feller, Fulbright, and Smith-Mundt programs.

He worked diligently to get qualified Europeans
to this country to study American literature.

 
Spiller, Robert Ernest 6
From 1966 to 1970 he was a member of the Fel-
lowship Committee of the American-Scandinavian
Foundation and was instrumental in building a
two-way relationship with Sweden and Norway.

In the 1930's when the American Literature
Group decided to publish a new literary history
of America, Spiller was chosen as chairman of
the committee to compile one. By 1940 the
Group, however, was no longer willing to sup-
port the project. Spiller, Henry Seidel Canby,
Willard Thorp, and Thomas Johnson, nevertheless,
were determined to finish the work. Supported

 

 
Spiller, Robert Ernest
by George Brett of Macmillan, they completed the
three volume Literary History of the United
States in 1948. It has since become a must in
the study of American literature.

With the exception of the Literary History
of the United States, a couple of shorter vol-

 

 

 

 

umes, and much editing, most of Spiller's lit-
erary work has taken the form of essays,
addresses, and reviews.

Two years before his retirement and since
Spiller has gathered the addresses, reviews,

 
Spiller, Robert Ernest 8

and essays which he had written and published
into a series of four collections, some of them
merely reprinted with commentary, some new ées-
says of summary of one or another aspect of his
past thoughts and actions. The Third Dimension
(1965) contains the essays written between 1929
and 1963. There is a basic statement on phil-
osophy and method and those essays which led up
to the new literary history. The second col-
lection, The Oblique Light (1968), is concerned
with revisionist studies of the accepted images
of major writers. Milestones in American

 

 

 

 

 
Spiller, Robert Ernest 9

 

Literary History (1977) is a collection of re-
views written during his career and an essay on
how the Literary History of the United States
had evolved. Late Harvest (1981), the last in
the series, is a gathering of essays and ad-
dresses on aspects of Spiller's involvement in

 

 

 

the renaissance of American Studies from 1920
to 1979. They deal with his movement beyond
his focus on American literary history.

The Spiller papers include two letters of
1982 and a copy of an address made to the

 
Spiller, Robert Ernest 10

 

Franklin Inn Club of Philadelphia in 1980 in
which he relates how he became a student of
and leader in the teaching of American litera-
ture and civilization.

Wilmington, New Hanover County, N. C.

 

Alexander Sprunt & Son, Inc., cotton export-
ers, was established in 1866 by Alexander
Sprunt (1815-1884), an immigrant from Scotland,
He was associated with and succeeded by his
sons, James Sprunt (1847-1924), and William H.

Sprunt, the former being the senior partner of
the business. During part of the company's
history, it was the largest exporter of cotton
in the country. It had significant effect upon

 
Sprunt, Alexander, & Son, Inc,

the structure of the cotton market and upon

the growth of Wilmingtonas a port. Before

1881 that city was not regarded as a cotton port,
but thirty years later it was one of the most
important in the country. In 1907, Sprunt alone
shipped 501,000 bales, operated six compresses,
and employed 1000 workers, The company drew

 

its business chiefly from Georgia and North and
South Carolina. Before 1875 the movement of
the crop depended upon factors, or agents of
the planters at convenient ports, port buyers,

 
Sprunt, Alexander, & Son, Inc, 3
and the receivers in the North who sold it to
domestic and foreign mills. In 1879, Sprunt
pioneered the practice, later adopted at other
Southern ports, of the direct employment of
transatlantic steamers which eventually elimi-
nated the middlemen and their commissions,

By 1908 more than fifty steamers were being
chartered annually by the company which eight
years later purchased the City of Wilmington,
the first transatlantic steamer owned by an
individual or corporation in North Carolina.

 

 

 

 
Sprunt, Alexander, & Son, Inc, 4
Sprunt then relied upon the compress operation
for his profit rather than upon a margin in the
price of cotton. The farmer received the
Liverpool or continental market price less the
cost of transportation only. The compresses
were primarily the facilities of the Champion
Compress and Warehouse Company and also the
Wilmington Compress and Warehouse Company. The
Ship Channel Compress Company of Houston,
Texas, was part of the firm's expansion outside
the South Atlantic states. Branch offices

 

 
Sprunt, Alexander, & Son, Inc. 5

 

functioned at various

times in New York City,

Boston, Savannah, Memphis, Charlotte, and else-
where. Numerous offices and agencies were

maintained in Europe,

such as those at Liver-

pool, Bremen, Le Havre, and Rotterdam. The firm
operated at Wilmington until the 1950's when it
was moved to Memphis,

There were various
agreements and in the

Sprunt & Hinson was the initial firm. It was
dissolved and replaced by Alexander Sprunt &
Son in 1875 (see the printed letter of April l,
1875, in the Joseph Ingram Papers). The
partnership gave way to a corporation in 1919
with the chartering of Alexander Sprunt & Son,
Inc., which remained its basic form. The Sprunt
Corporation, a holding company, was established
in 1931 in Delaware for tax purposes; its name
was changed in 1937 to Alexander Sprunt & Son,

of James Sprunt and the company date during
1884-1952, but they are numerous only for

1904, 1906, 1909-1910, and 1919-1921. Account
books, minutes, and correspondence are available
also for a number of domestic and foreign
subsidiaries and branch offices, but these are
often quite fragmentary. More than thirty

President Abraham Lincoln will not remove
Frémont, and complains (Oct. 29) of “inaction

On Dec. 3 Stafford says that c. S. Gen.
Sterling Price has gone to Kan., and that
U. S. Gen. Thomas L. Price has reportedly been
arrested.

For a time Stafford belonged to the 16th
Battery (Light) of the Ohio Artillery (letter
of Dec. 22, 1861). He writes on Apr. 5, 1862;

Confederate guerrillas in Ark. (Steele and
Curtis appear in other letters, e. g., Sept.
1, 1862.)

In a letter of June 11, 1862, written in
camp at Batesville, Ark., Stafford mentions his

On July 25 Abraham Lincoln is mentioned.
Stafford hopes for the emancipation of the
Slaves, and for a confiscation act. Gov.

David Tod (1805-1868), of Ohio, and conecrip-
tion are also discussed. Speculation in cotton
by U. S. Army officers is denounced. [See also
letter of Aug. 5]

He complains on Aug. 16 of the immorality of
his comrades in arms. On the 28th it is

A newspaper clipping contains a letter of
Aug. 5, 1862, from Hindman to Cooper, explaining
the Confederate situation in Ark.

S. M. Stafford complains of illness in a
number of letters in 1862. On Oct. 18 he writes
from a public school in Keokuk, Iowa, which has

 

been converted into a hospital. There are three
other large hospitals there. This is his last
dated letter. Two letters of Oct., 1862 are
by his brother, Robert.

The correspondence resumes on Nov. 7, 1864,

soldier suggesting that Savannah is the des-
tination of the Union Army under Gen. W. T.

the writer describes. how Union troops lived off
the country, and reports the capture of Fort
McAllister on the Ogeechee River and the Fed-
eral casualties that resulted.

A letter of Apr. 9, 1865, from Vicksburg,
Miss., is valuable for its information about
Federal prisoners-of-war and Confederate pris-
oner-of-war camps. The 4,000 former Federal

prisoners in Vicksburg were quite dejected.
Those who had been in the Andersonville, Ga.,
prison were the worst, mere walking skeletons.
They were fed and cared for by the U. S. Sani-
tary Commission. A large quantity of supplies
was obteined. The exchange of prisoners was
later broken up. A number of northern ladies

 

were in Vicksburg with the Sanitary Commission.
One of them was Mrs. Cordelia Adelaide (Perrine)
Harvey, widow of a gov. of Wis. One former
Federal prisoner had kept the books at Ander-
sonilie. He listed all deaths by regiment and

The letter of Apr. 9 also contains comments
on the development of Cairo, I1l., and Memnhis,
Tenn., and the decline of the population of
Vicksburg during the war.

The death of Lincoln is mentioned on Apr.
24, 1865, as are two northern ladies who had
come down to teach contrabands.

Staley. There are other deeds for land in that
county and in Chatham Co. Most of the letters

 

are those which passed among his children and

Staley, John W, 2
many letters were sent from various places in
Indiana, Kansas, and Missouri; and Daniel L.,
who contributed more letters than anyone else;
first from Green River in Polk Co., N. C. and
after 1873 from the region of the Pacific coast,
mostly from the eastern border of Washington
Territory, where in the early 1890's he became
the founder of the village named "Staley" in
Whitmore Co. Incidentally, John W. founded a
village in Randolph Co., N. C. also.

Besides the usual preponderance of private
and family interests discussed in these letters,
they contain very regular and systematic reports

 

 

 
Staley, John wW. 5
of the relative scarcity and prices of things
bought and sold on the farm, over a wide range
of territory, covering the period from about
1850 to 1890. Some of these contrasts are
pointed out in letters written immediately after
they were received by writers living in the
valley of the Wabash in western Indiana, and
the valley of the Potomac in eastern Va.

The era of the Civil War is covered by cor-
respondence from various soldiers, These let-
ters show very little interest in the regional
or national issues of the day. The names of

political parties “oe receive only

 

 
Staley, John wW. 4
casual mention. The writers are primarily in-
terested in the physical @omforts and especial-
ly the discomforts of the private citizens and
soldiers, The Staley sons were all engaged in
some form of military service. John W., whom
they addressed as Colonel Staley, seems to have
occupied a very important position in connection

 

with the home guard, while the other brothers,
and their former playmates, report their experi
ences in the camps and on the battlefields,

some in 1862, very gleefully, from northern Va.,
while others, in 1864, come in a different tone

from southern Va, The ry other campaign areas

John W., Staley is the southeastern sections of
N. C. during the last two years of the war.

For a very vivid firsthand description of
exhaustive marching, maneuvers, and cavalry
encounters, the following letters may be singled
out for special interest. They were written by
a Randolph Co, citizen named Madison Lowes
under dates of Nov. 29, 1863 and Feb. 13, 1864.
In all these ordeals he is desperately optimist
ic and still expects an independent Confederacy
to emerge within the next few months. At the

down in the mouth but also from the mouth down.
Letters written during the war occasionally
mention commodity prices. On Feb. 13, 1864,
Madison Lowe writes of a skirmish with Federal
Cavalry near Shepardsville, N. C. Letters
written by D. L. Staley in Polk Co., N. C.,
between March andjPecember, 1864, mention steal-
ing by deserters and Federals in the mountains
of N. C. and Tenn., and the operation of impress
ment agents from Longstreet's Corps. A letter
of Aug. 11, 1864, from Ream's Station, Va.,
tells of a revival in the Confederate Army the

writer has been attending for two years.

During the early period of the war one of
the sons of the family living in Indiana vol-
unteered in the Confederate Army, was wounded,
and after a severe illness died at the home of
his relatives in Randolph Co,

There are petitions in May and June 1864,
from J. N. B. Barker and Andrew Ferguson,
blacksmiths of Randolph Co., seeking exemption
from military service,

After the war was over, the reconstructiGn
problems discussed in the letters are usually

not of a national or eo nature, not even

 

 
Staley, John wW.

 

of racial importance. The writers are primar
concerned as to how they themselves are individ
ually affected. In 1870 John W. Staley was
appointed administrator of the estate of his
father who had died intestate, and in settling
these accounts the greatest difficulty arose
over the question as to what kind of money,

Confederate or United States, was involved,
During the laterdecades covered by the let-
ters, by far the greater number come from John
W. Staley's brother Daniel, who was then suc-

Staley, John W. J x
comparisons are very obvious as to agricultural
methods and the general living conditions on
the farms of the new West and the older East.
In the matter of public education, however, they
are very similar; and both of the Staley broth-
ers are very much interested and active in
starting and developing good public schools.
Among the miscellaneous papers of this collect-
ion are copies of several addresses by John W.
Staley, who also for many years was a member,
often chairman, of the board of education for
District No. 22 of Randolph Co.

Benjamin E, Stanfield (Aug. 20, 1876-Mar.29,
1935) was born in Leasburg, N.C. and died in
the same state at Timberlake. Stanfield spent
his life as a rural minister in the North

 

Carolina Methodist Episcopal Conference, Sout
During his period of service, thirty two years
in length, he served at Grimesland, Spring

Hope, Richmond County, Robeson, Chadbourn,

 
Stanfield . he te Sheleh
Jonesboro, Creedmoor, Durham Circuit and Mt.
Tirzah,

In 1897, December 28, Stanfield married
Josephine Hambrick. Two years later he was
ordained a deacon in the North Carolina
Conference; and in 1904 he was ordainéd an

elder and admitted to the North Carolina
Conference at Henderson, N.C.

His papers, which were taken from his pastor
books, are in general confined to the finan-
cial affairs of the charges which he served,

 
Sfanfire/d on be Skeret

The sums collected are interesting in that
they reflect the prosperity of the rural
Methodists during the World War years in the
increased size of contributions. Similarly
they reflect the agricultural depression of
the 1920's in the decreased size of contri-
butions. Although overshadowed by financial
records, the collection also, in the pastor's
pooks, includes records of marriages, baptisms
and deaths of members of the churches which
Stanfield served. The records are of more
than ordinary value because of their complete-

ness.

 
 

Stanfield, Benjamin E 4
Stanfield recorded a wealth of information in

the Pastor's Books that he kept, one for each
year. The collection includes a series of these
volumes from 1903-1904 through 1933-1934, com-
plete except for 1930-1931. They represent his
work on the following circuits: Grimesland and
Vanceboro, 1903-1907; Spring Hope and Mt. Pleas-

ant, 1907-1909; Mt. Pleasant, 1909-1911; Rich-
mond, 1911-1913; Robeson, 1913-1917; Chadbourn,
1917-1921; Jonesboro, 1921-1925; Creedmoor, 1925
1929; Durham, 1929-1930; and Mt. Tirzah, 1931-

Papers of Edward John Stanley, Second
Baron Stanley of Alderley (1802-1869), English
politician, “liberal” reformer, M.P. for North
Cheshire (1832-1), and patronage secretary to

the Treasury (1835-1) in Lord Melbourne's
second administration. The letters in this
collection relate to matters of politics mostly
(elections or patronage), but they also cover

a wide range of other topics. There are three

 
 

Stanley, Edward J., 2nd Baron Stanley 3
Nov. 13, 1937). Stanley looked after his own
constituency: in 1835 (letter of Feb. 4) he
gave his support to the establishment of a
"liberal" party paper in North Cheshire.

In 1836, Stanley was appointed a member of
a provisional committee to organize and estab-

blish "The Reform Club" in London (letter of

Feb. 6, 1836). The other members of this com-
mittee were: Henry A. Aglionby, Alexander
Bannerman, John Blackburne, Montague S. Chap-
man, William Clay, Thomas Cokes, O'Connor Don,
Edward Divett, Lord Ebrington, William Ewart,

or four references to particular elections.
These include: a letter by E, Davenport (Nov.
6, 1836) concerning elections at Runcorn in
Cheshire and the policy of the Whigs to declare
themselves against peerage reform; three let-
ters of Sir Bufane Shaw Donkin (July, 1837 )
regarding his defeat in Northumberland, July 25,
by William Holmes, a Tory, who, according to
Donkin, owed his victory to the great amounts
of "Carlton Club gold" used to bribe voters;
letters concerning certain voting irregulari-
ties in the borough of Denbigh (Oct. 21 &

was appointed secretary.

Three letters (1836) to Stanley from Alex.
Reid concern the possible effects of the Liver
pool Dock Bill and the investigations of the
Bast India Salt Committee of the House of Com-
mons upon the shipping business around Liver-
pool, Runcorn, and Northwich. Reid wrote of
the rivalry between these ports, the price of
salt in the area, and the sudden growth of
joint stock companies at Runcorn.

There is a letter of petition to Stanley
from William Parker (representing the inhabi-

 

 
Stanley, Edward J., 2nd Baron Stanley
tants of Macclesfield opposing the use of
Courts of Request to collect monies in the
borough (Mar. 3, 1836).

There is an exchange of letters (3) be-
tween Lord John Russell and the Earl of Hare-
wood (Henry Lascelles) concerning a lack of
magistrates in the Parish of Halifax (cf. Mar.

 

12, 1836). There are three or four letters
concerning the sale of certain crown lands - 4
sale in which political considerations played
a part, and in which Lord Duncannorf and Sir
Edward Knatchbull were involved (cf. letter of

Whig party, but who had yet to be paid for his
services. The letter (Nov. 11, 1837) mentions
in particular a pamphlet written to vindicate
a church tithe bill introduced into the House
by Lord Morpeth (Seventh Barl of Carlisle).
The correspondents include: James Cappock,
Sir Rufane Shaw Donkin, Thomas Drummond, one

"A Visit from the Joy Riders"

 

This MS. is the rough draft of a poem,
"€ Visit from the Joy Riders" by Frank
Lebby Stanton(b. February 22, 1857; d. 1927)

Stanton was born in Charleston , 8. C. ,
later going to Georgia where he was
chiefly identified with the Atlanta
Constitution. He was a lecturer of note
and also contributed to the leading

 
Stanton, Frank Lebby Sketch (2)

 

magazines. His poetry is well known and
some of it is good, being of a humorous
and at times of a poignant nature.
Several volumes of his poetry have been
published in addition to numerous poems
that have appeared in periodicals and
news papers. Evidently "A Visit from the
Joy Riders" was never published in book

form.

Generally speaking, this set covers five
generations of the Staples family from 18%
to 1931, but actually the bulk of the mater-
ial concerns only three members of the fam-
ily, Abram Penn Staples (1793-1856); his

grandson, Abram Penn Staples (d. 1913); and
his great-granddaughter, Harris DeJarnette
Staples. There are, of course, letters from

other members of the family, but these are

 
STAPLES, ABRAM PENN Sketch. (2)
so few and so disconnected as to be of little
value.

Abram Staptés (1793-1856) was the son of Sam-
uel Granville and Lucinda Penn Staples and
was a native of Patrick Co., Va. He attended
the University of North Carolina and a letter
dated Aug. 13, 1816, from Chapel Hill gives
his father a graphic description of his life
there. In 1818 and 1819 he was a member of the
General Assembly at Richmond and during these

years several interesting letters passed betwee

 

 
STAPLES, ABRAM PENN Sketch (3)

himself and his father, Samuel. One dated Jan.
28, 1819, mentions a bill “endowing an Univer-
sity at Charlottesville," and a proposal to
combine Montgomery, Franklin, and Patrick
counties into a single new county. During this
period, too, there are several letters from

 

Samuel containing information on the sale of
tobacco.

During the 1820's and 1830's Abram was clerk
of Patrick Co., Va., and of the Suverior Court.

As one would :@Xnect, therefore, the corres-

 
STAPLES, ABRAM PENN Sketch (4)
pondence during this period is composed large-
ly of requests for records, legal data, etc.
Much in evidence are letters from James Range=
ley of Somerset Co., Maine, and from Geo. Hair-
stone of Va. These men were laying conflict-
ing claims to a piece of property "on the

South Waters of Smith's River & Blackberry

 

Creek." This correspondence runs from April
4, 1899, to May 24, 1838.

Between the years 1838 and 1855 (at which
time the chronological continuity breaks orf

 
STAPLES, -ABRAM PENN Sketch (5)
abruptly) there are several letters each from
Archibald Stuart and Washington Charles De-
-Pauw to Abram Staples. The former was Whig
Representative in Congress from Virginia and
apparently a personal friend of Stavles, for
he wrote to him not only of current legislative
activities but also of his personal problems
and financial difficulties. The DePauw letters
are all of a business nature.

Probably the most vaulable letter in this

set 1s one dated May 24, 1845. It was writ-

 

 
STAPLES, ABRAM PENN Sketch (6)

ten by Beverley Tucker to Staples concerning
the progress of the latter's son, Waller R.
Staples, at William and Mary. In the letter
he mentions the people from whom the characters
in The Partisan Leader were drawn.

The next group of letters begins in 1883
with letters from Sallie Cugf{ng*Hunt to her
future husband, Abram Penn Staples. This was
the grandson of the above-mentioned Staples.
These letters, although interesting, are of

little vatue,

 

 

 
STAPLES, ABRAM PENN Sketch (7)

The third generation covered by the set is
represented by Miss Harris DeJarnette Staples,
daughter of Abram P. Staples and Sallie Cush-
ing (Hunt) Staples. She was a student at
Randolph-Macon College. There are large groups
of letters from four ardent suitors and scat-
tered ones from several others. Most inter-

 

esting, however, are the letters to Harris
from her doting parents. - The stationery indi-
cates that her father was at this time a pro-
fessor of law at Washington and Lee University,

 
STAPLES, ABRAM PENN Sketch (8)
but there is never any mention of his work in
his numerous letters and notes.

The last letter in this set which is worthy
of note is one from Seantor Geo. Wharton Pep-
per to David W. Persinger, an aspiring young
lawyer and apparently a friend of the Staples
family. He states that he 1s enclosing a let-
ter of introduction to Daniel N. Kirby, a law-
yer in Saint Louis, in-which city David plans-
to establish his legal practice.

This set, although interesting throughout

 

 
STAPLES, ABRAM PENN Sketch (9)

as the chronicle of a prominent Virginia
family, 1s valuable only up to 1855 as histor-
ical source material.

Harris,

 

5S items added 7-11-57. The first, dated
in Feb., 1805, is signed by Col. Samuel G.

Staples, QGlerk of Patrick Co, Va. Court and
father of ‘%bram Penn Staples*{1793-1856). The

second item is a letter of June 13, 1811, by

 
Staples, Abram Penn 10
Alexander Austin to Col. Staples, mentioning
various people and things, including legal
affairs, James Penn, and Fleming Saunders. I.
For information about the last, see the

His sister, Harriet C., writes to him in
1856 from the Judson Female Institute, in Marion

She also has some literary compositions in

A letter of Jan. 14, 1861, from a cousin, W.

how the town is booming, the collapsing of the
new courthouse, the secession of Miss., and Unio
sentiment in Attala Co., of which Kosciusk Ss
the county seat. Later McClanahan, as a member
of Forrest's cavalry, was killed in the Battle
of Harrisburg, or Tupelo, Miss.

Some letters of 1861 deal with secession.
One, dated July 15, discusses the Civil War in
Ark. Another which may have been dated Aug. 7,
speaks of the fighting in Va.

 

 
stapp, Joseph D. é

An interesting item is "The Southern
Wagon: Confederate Air," dated Sept. 1, 1861,
and composed by Stapp to the music of "Wait for
the Wagon." Secession is praised, along with
Jefferson Davis, A. H. Stephens, and P. G. T.
Beauregard, while the "Lincoln cut-throats"
are assailed.

 

Stapp writes to his father on July 11, 1862,
from Tuscaloosa Camp, where he is with the 4lst
Regt. of Ala. Inf. Vols., that he has a surgeon'd
certificate of exemption from military duty, and
that he has only to assist the surgeon at sick

call. He mentions also an epidemic of measles
in camp and* the hiring°of substitutes.. In his
next letter he mentions the hiring of a sub-
stitute by some relative, perhaps a brother, but
later the brother is in service.

Some of Stapp's letters of 1863 deal with
the Chattanooga Campaign; C. S. Gens. Braxton

Bragg and Benjamin Hardin Helm; Breckinridge's
Div.; the Confederate Hospital in Clinton, Tenn.
camp life; and horses.

Other Civil War subjects include the Negroes
at Stapp's home; C. S. A. Army food and clo-

thing; and Wm. Joseph Hardee.

There is a sharecropping contract of Jan. l,
1869, between Stapp, then a farmer of Pickens
Co., Ala., and several freedmen, who were to work
on his farm in return for one third of the crop.

Elbert Decatur Willett, Sr. (b. 1828) writes
on Oct. 14, 1886,to Stapp about legal affairs
and personal debts.

Darius Starr prepared for college at St.
Philip's academy in Andover, N. H. In 1861
during his sophomore year at Dartmouth, he
enlisted with many of his schoolmates in the
U. S. Army. He served with Co. F., 2nd Regiment

of U. S. Sharpshooters which was assigned to
the Army of the Potomac during the Civil War.
Starr achieved the rank of sergeant and was
appointed to keep the business records for his

Company. He re-enlisted in Dec., 1863, but

 
Starr, Darius. 2

 

the letters in this collection terminate on
Apr. 22, 1864.

Starr's correspondence includes letters to
members of his family. He discussed the
activities of his regiment and those of the
Army in Virginia from 1862 to 1864. He
commented on numerous individuals, especially

G. B. McClellan, Gov. Horatio Seymour of
New York, Gov. John A. Andrew of Mass., and
Joseph Hooker.

The Battles of Gainesville and

Fredericksburg and numerous smaller skirmishes

 
Starr, Darius 3
are described at length by Starr. An undated
broadside lists the engagements in which his
regiment participated.

Starr also noted many incidents of
importance. His letters contain remarks on
emancipation, the attitude and morale of his
fellow soldiers, railroads, newspaper
reporters, weapons, and other topics pertinent
to the Civil War.

The volume is a diary kept by Starr in
1863. It is an excellent record of a Union

soldier's life in the Army. Starr entered
his remarks regularly and commented on camp
life and his own activities.

This collection, though large &n bulk and xan

long in chronological span,is chiefly confined to

1909, 1916, 1917, 1919, 1922 and 1993, It con-

sists of letters received, carbon copies of re-

plies, notes, memoranda and 100 volumes composed

 

of registers of discounted bills, note ticklers,
cash books, accounts, statements, stock certifi-
cates books, registers of drafts, drafts on the

city bank of Richmond, overdraft registers, tel-
lers' daily balance, register of liberty bonds,

 
STATE B. OF C, —2=

expense accounts and trial bahances. In general
the bound volumes are more uniform chronologi-
Cally than the papers and letters.

The collection reveals the workings of a
small country bahk with a branch at Carterswille,
Va., neither of which was able to muster suffi-
cient resources for reopening after the bahk
holiday of 1933, Included are numerous requests
for small loans, copies of letters to delinquent
holders of notes, letters enclosing small a-
mounts to be added to accounts and copies of

casiier's letters protesting overdrafts and

 

 
STATE B. OF CC, =3~
acknowledging receipts of money. Typical of
the bank's difficulties was failure for eight
years to pay the attorney who drew up the chart-
ter.

Roughly interpreted the career of the bank
falls in two periods (1) the period when George
J. Stoneman was cashier apparently until about

 

1908 (2) the period when George Pannill Hodgson
served as cashier from about 1909 until 1933,
By 1916, if not earlier, other officers were

Cartersville branch, An influential stock hol-
der in 1917 was L. M, Williams of John L. Wil-
liams and Sons, bankers of Richmond, Va. Of the
200 shares of stock in 1923, 60 were owned by

the cashier of the Columbia Bank, 55 by the cash-
ter of the Cartersville branch, and 53 by a lum-

 

berman, all of whom were borrowers from the bank
except Hodgson, eashier of the parent bank at
Columbia.

Only a few people borrowed any butt: small
Sums from the bank. In 1909 the bank experi-~

 
STATE B. OF C, -5-

enced considerable trouble with the collection

of a note of $6,000 from W. R. Myers, president
of the Bankers Trust Company ofVirginia and a
contractor, and received threats fromthe state
bank examiner. Again in 1922 there was some

Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co,, other fertilizer
companies, the International Harvester Co., and
other firms manufacturing products used by: farm-
ers. Of significancd gs a factor in the bank's
agricultural patronage was its subscription to
the Southern Planter (Richmond) for 100 copies
of each issue for 2 years, 1917 and 1923, Oc-
casionally the bank transacted business with lo-
Cal units of the Farmers! Union,

Of greatest importance tn agricultural ac-
tivities was the bank's connection with the

Tri-State Cooperative Marketing Association for

tobacco growers, Contrary to general opinion
and to the basis of the fight made against the
marketing association by local business inthe
Va.-Carolina area, the Association dié or offered
to do considerable business with local banks.
Certainly the Association did a comparatively
large business with the State Bank of Columbia.

 

Includéd during 1922 are a number of letters from
Oliver J. Sands, executive manager of the Co-op
erative Marketing Association, and from James H.
Craig, treasurer, Beginning May 9, 1922, the

correspondence’ relative to the marketing associ-

 
STATE B. OF C, -2
ation continues through 1923, These letters,
many of them addressed to "Banks of North Caro-
lina, South Carolina and Virginia" reveal very
clearly the banking policg of the Association.
In addition to agricultural interests the ba
served many small business men engaged in such
activities as mining, poultry farming, lumbering
and the production of fruit. A series ¢ letters
in 1909 from August Dietz, vice president and
treasurer of the Young American Gold Mining Co,

Argus Gold Mining Co., also of Lantana, Va., Old

18,791 items added 12-20-46

The material added is very similar to that
of the original collection. The bulk of it
is for the years 1908, 1915, 1918, 1920, 1930,
1931, 1932, 1933. The items before 1904 when
application was made for the charter of the

 
STATE BANK OF COLUMBIA Sketch 11
Bank at Columbia, consists mainly of odds and

widely scattered bills and letters for build-
ing supplies, agricultural supplies, imple-
ments, and hardware. The earliest coherent
item is a deed for land in Fluvanna Co., Va.,
for George P. Gowherd, who was later president
of the bank. This may be the land on which
the bank was later built.

 

 

There is a series of letters to and from

 
STATE BANK OF COLUMBIA Sketch (3)

the Bank of Rachmond in 1906-1907 at which
time the Bank of Richmond threatened to open
a Bank at Columbia if the Columbia bank
opened a _ branch bank at Palmyra, Va. The

Bank of Richmond wanted $500 to keep out of
the field, but the dispute was finally solved

 

by having the State Bank at Columbia have
$1000 worth of stock and George L. Stoneman
as one of the directors.

Many interesting things are revealed in

this collection about the workings of this
small agricultural bank. Beginning in 1907
there are periodic letters from the Banking
Division of the State Corporation Commission
following the tri-yearly examination of the
bank by the commission, Repeatedly from 1909
to 1950, the commission warned that the lia-
bility of the officers and directors of the
Bank was too high, there was insufficient
security for loans, too many large overdrafts

bia was negligent about filing reports with
the commission, tardy in remedying the ills
pointed out to "them and in 1915, 1922 and
1929 the Corporation Commission threatened
to fine them, Throughout its history, late-

of this bank and its patrons continually con-

The State Bank of Columbia confined it-
self to small local loans until about the
time of the first world war, In 1921 the bank
reached the peak of its success, for the
population of the tbdwn of Columbia increased
from 135 in 1915 to 250 in 1921. In Nov.1921
plans were begun for enlarging the bank build
ing and facilities. In Sept. 1923 the Tobacco
Growers Cooperative Association built a
warehouse at Columbia and this inoreaged the
prosperity of the community. George *,

Hodgson, Cashier of the Bank was Secretary

of this Association and in the years that
followed, he, through the Bank, lent con-

of the association,

In 1925 G,P, Hodgson was instrumental in
organi,ing a local Bankers' Association,
known as the James River Bankers Association,

In Dec. 1928 the State Banking examiner
warned that the Bank had lent too much money

with insufficient collateral for loans, had
too much overdrawaming and too many doubtful
loans, The examiner refused to allow divi-
dends to be paid, termed the condi¢ionof the
bank as "serious", and threatened to appoint
a receiver if the situation was not remedied,
Some effort was made to collect the money
owea them, but because the bank was a more or
less personal enterprise, this was difficult,

In March 1929 the Bank was still borrowing
excessively - at 3 times their capital and
was again forbidden to pay dividends. Further
efforts were made to stabilize at this time
but to no avail and by August 1950 the Bank
at Columbia asked the Bank of Louisa, Va} to
buy them out for this was the only alternat-

The material for 1931, 1932, 1933 is almo-
st exclusively concerned with the settlement
of the banks debts including the briefs and
facts for court settlements, collection of
loané and disposal of property. The debt was
reduced quickly and appreciably and as early
as March 1931 plans were being formulated to
reopen the bank or to reorganize and open a

les in the community continued; however,
those interested in this project were never
able to muster sufficient resources or sup-
port to carry this through and it is to be
imagined that the people of this community
thereafter used the el ice of Richmond,
Palymyra and Louisa, Va.

6901 items added 3-27-54. Most of these
are note notices, ticklers, and credit
memoranda, but there are 1600 items of cor-
respondence and other papers AiAy From
1866 into the 1930's. Since the-tontents of

of the protions of the collection already
described, a description of this latest

addition is unnecessary.
25 items added, 3-25-63. Three of these con-

cern the State Bank of Columbia, but the others
are papers of Stoneman as mayor of Columbia and
six photographs taken during a flood there.
These latter twenty-two items have been kept to-
gether and filed under Feb, 1, 1902, the date of
the first item in the folder, The mayoralty
papers are mainly warrants for the arrest of
alleged criminals.

This collection contains items which be-
longed to Sir George Leonard Staunton, diploma-
tist, and to his son, Sir George Thomas Staunto
author of various works on China. The material
which relates to the elder Staunton consists
mainly of letters that were addressed to him or
to members of his family. The collection has a
large number of letters that were written by
Thomas Staunton as well as many which were sent
to him. There are also several diaries, usuall
incomplete,and a group of clippings.

Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas

 

Sir George Leonard Staunton (1737-1801) was
born in County Galway, Ireland. He graduated
M. D. from a collge at Montpellier, France, in
1758, and he lived on Grenada, B. W. I., during
most of the 1760's and 1770's. His first diplo-
matic missions were in 1781-1784, when he was
secretary to George Macartney, First Earl Macart
ney, who was Governor of Madras. In 1792-1794,
Staunton was secretary in the first British
mission that was sent to China, the Macartney

Mission.

Genealogy of the Staunton family can be
found in Sir John Bernard Burke, A Genealogical
and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry of
Ireland (London, 1912), p. 658. Irish land
holdings of the Staunton family are listed in
U. H. Hussey de Burgh, The Landowners of Ireland
(Dublin, 1878), p. 284. The owner of this
property in 1878 is George Thomas Lynch-Staunton
a cousin and heir of Sir George Thomas Staunton.
Lynch-Staunton resides at Clydagh, Headford,
County Galway, Ireland.

A useful source relative to Sir George

Thomas Staunton's career in China is the list

of officials at the East India Company's factory
at Canton; see The East-India Register and
Directory for 1806, p. 305. See especially
Lydia Luella Spivey, “Sir George Thomas Staunton;
Agent for the British East India — in

 

 

 

China, 1798-1817". (Thesis, A.M., Duke
University, 1969).

There are several items which explain family
relationships. A certified genealogy (1792) and
a patent of arms (1817) concern the Stauntons,

 
Staunton, Sirs George L. and George T, me |

A document of 1788 lists the heirs of Benjamin
Collins, a banker of Salisbury, whose daughter
was Jane (Collins) Staunton, wife of Sir George
Leonard Staunton. Other items of family interest
are an epitaph of 1777, a clipping of April 26,
1838, a will of April 17, 1885, and several
clippings in the scrapbook.

 

The letters from the eighteenth century in-
clude scattered items from members of the Collis
and Staunton families. Correspondents among the
Stauntons (several were Irish) were E. C. Bentley,

 
Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas 5
Only three items relate to his early life--an
extract from 1755, a note of 1771, and references
to him in a letter of Feb. 8, 1823. One letter
(July 28, 1779) dates from his residence on
Grenada. Several letters date from the visit to
Paris in 1780 by Staunton, his wife and Earl
Macartney,’ who were held as hostages for a time.

 

A small group of letters relate to Staunton's
diplomatic career. Among them are the instruc-
tions (Oct. 31, 1783) which the Select Committee
of Ft. St.George, Madras, gave Staunton and Anthony
Sadleir when they went to negotiate a treaty of
peace with the ruler “e Mysore. Four items

addressed to Alyward L, Staunton; these items
range from 1743to 1791. Correspondents from the
Collins family are: Bacon, Peter B. Brodie,

 

Benjamin Collins; Benjamin C, Collins, Mary

In this collection there are only two letters

Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas 6
(1781-1784) contain information about persons
and events which were involved in the British
rule of Madras and Calcutta. A letter (Sept. 18,
1791) from the Gov. of Madras discusses the mili-
tary positions of the ruler of Mysore and of the
British forces under the command of Charles
Cornwallis, First Marquis and Second Earl Corn-
wallis. Only five items relate to the mission to
China in 1792-1794, and the more important one
(Feb. 21, 1792) involves the selection of Chinese
missionaries as tutors or interpreters.

Other letters from 1785-1801 pertain to family

 

 
Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas 7
matters, Staunton's finances, and the attainment
of an Irish baronetey (1785). Five items (Jan.-
Feb., 1801) relate to the death of Sir George
Leonard Staunton,

Sir George Thomas Staunton was the only
surviving child of Sir George Leonard Staunton.
Thomas Staunton accompanied his father to China

 

in 1792-1794. During 1798-1817 he was writer,
supercargo, member of the Select Committee, and,
finally, chief of the East India Company's factay
at Canton. In 1816-1817, Staunton was a ranking
member of Britain's second mission to China. After

 
taunton, Sirs George Leonard. and George Thomas 8
1817 he lived in England and was an M. P. during
most of the period of 1818-1852.

The items in this collection which relate to
the youth of Thomas Staunton are scattered, but
fairly numerous. A letter of June 30, 1781,
records his birth, and two others(Apr. 8 and June

, 1784) record an early visit to his Irish

 

relatives. Only one letter (Dec.9,1792) dates
from his first trip to China. Several letters
(Feb. 1, 1788; Mar. 10,13 and Oct. 27, 1791)
relate to Staunton's education. After 1796 the
correspondence of Thomas Staunton, usually addres
sed either to his —_ to his mother, is

 
Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas 9
frequent and extensive. The items of 1796-1801
and his early diaries (discussed below) are
valuable for information about his education,

During 1798-1817 Staunton was a member of the
factory at Canton and Macao. He madé several
trips to England, and the periods 6f his residere
in China were 1800-1801, 1805-1807, 1810-1811,
and 1814-1817. Except for the items of 1800-1801
which were addressed mostly to his father, these
letters were sent to his mother, Jane (Collins)
Staunton. This correspondence does not contain
an elaboration either of the operations of the

 

 
Sstauntons, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas

factory or of the British relations with the
Chinese, but there are numerous scattered detail
Staunton noted several disputes between the fac-
tory and the provincial Chiness officials--a dis-
agreement over duties(June 25, 1801), Chinese
attempts to assert jurisdiction over British

Subjects (Mar. 27, 1800, and Mar. 22, 1807),

and Chinese protests about the presence of Britid
warships (Oct. -Dec.,1814). During 1810-1811,
the trade through Canton was languishing. Only
five letters date from the mission to China under

 
Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomasll
Lord Amherst,in 1816-1817, and none give diplo-
atic information. An item of Aug.7,1816, lists
the composition of this mission. Letters of Aug.
9, 1800, and Feb. 26, 1801 (among othérs), give
information on the ways in which members of the
factory could acquire wealth. There are appro-
ximately 120 letters from China. The correspon-

 

dence indicates that Staunton wrote frequently to
ir John Barrow, Secretary to the Admiralty and
close friend of the family, but this collection
has only one of these items.
Most of the other letters which Staunton sent

 
Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas 12
o his mother were written from England and, to

lesser extent, from Ireland and the Continent.
Staunton traveled through England and Wales in
1802, 1809, and 1812-1813. When he was searching
for an estate, he visited Staunton Hall (July,18@
Newstead Abbey (July 1817), and the Leigh Estate
(July 1819). In 1802 and 1813 Staunton visited
reland and wrote fairly detailed accounts of his
estates in County Galway. In 1818 he toured
France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and Belgium.

Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas 1
A few letters relate to France and England in
1780-1792. One of Jan. 18, 1780, has a discussia
of social life in Paris, and one of Oct. 22, 1789
gives a few impressions of Paris and of the Frend
National Assembly. A writer of Dec. 16, 1792
discusses the current British attitude toward
the French Revolution and mentions proposed

 

Changes in the ministry of Pitt.

A considerable number of letters and a diary
(discussed below), give detailed information about
Staunton's political activities in the 1830's and
hisppinions about various aspects of reform.

 
Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas 1
Approximately thirty letters, mostly from Nov.,
1834-Sept., 1835, are preserved as drafts in
Staunton's journal of 1831-1837. Most of these
items refer to the election of 1835 in South
Hampshire in which the reform coalition of Staun-
ton and Henry John Temple, Third Viscount Palmer-
ston, met defeat. There are also seven letters

 

from Palmerston (Dec., 1834-Feb., 1835) which
give details of political procedures, results
of gagvasses, and campaign expenses.. Two letters

( and Dec. 17, 1852) relate to the electia
in which Staunton retired from Parliament.

 
Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas 15
In this collection there is a large number. of
miscellaneous letters of which many were written
by distinguished persona either in Britain or
on the Continent. This material constitutes a
large part of the correspondence from; 1819-1858 ,
but it usually has importance only for a study of
Staunton. The only sizeable group of letters
from a single source is the correspondence from
Palmerston. A letter of 1853 from Palmerston's
secretary, H. Waddington, may reflect the minis-
ter's views about strikes and the operation of
economic laws as a regulator of wages.

 

 
Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas
Considerable detailed information about the
political activities of Staunton and Palmerston
in the 1830's is included in more than eighty
clippings which Staunton took from various news-
papers (most of these clippings are attached to
the first and last pages of the journal of 1831-
1837). These items relate primarily to the
parliamentary elections of 1832 and 1835 in South
Hampshire, and they include letters from various
candidates and political committees, reports of
meetings, results of canvasses, electoral returns
from the polling places in the county, and accoun

This collection contains four travel journals
which Staunton wrote before 1796 and another
hich dates from 1826-1830. There is a journal
of 1831-1837 in which Staunton recorded informa-
tion relative to his parliamentary activities.

A small diary (45 pp.) is apparently the third
of a series which Thomas Staunton wrote during a
our of England and Scotland with his father. He
probably wrote this volume between 1791 and 1796.
Staunton gives descriptions of the processes which
ne saw in several factories--the tanning of hides
and the making of brushes and ropes at Glasgow,

 

the spinning of cotton at New Lanark, and the
making of cloth at Paisley. Other comments indi-
ate Staunton's interests in botany, geology, and
astronomy (see other diaries also).

Two volumes comprise a diary which Thomas

 
Staunton, Sirs George Leonard and George Thomas

Staunton wrote when he,at the age of eleven,
accompanied his father and Earl Macartney to
China. The first volume (276 pp.) has daily
entries for Sept. 15,1792-May 16, 1793. The
first ninety-six pages of the second volume

(179 pp.) are lost, and it has daily entries for

Aug. 30, 1793-Feb. 1, 1794,

The journal consists of miscellaneous comments
about geography, plant and animal life, and the

Three months are missing from the second
olume on China, and the entries resume with the

 

reception of the mission by the Chinese emperor
at Jehnol. Although Staunton recorded his impres-
Sions of the palace ’and of the official ceremonies
e did not mention diplomatic matters. After
leaving Jehol the mission briefly visited Peiping

entirely on rivers and canals, and the journey

A small volume contains the journal which
homas Staunton wrote when he toured Europe in
1826-1827 and 1830. Most of the content consists
of notations of places which the writer visited
in various cities. The entries for the first
of these tours (first and last parts of the

journal) are for Oct., 1826-May 8, 1827. The
route went through a large part of Italy, southen

Perhaps the most valuable volume in this
collection is the miscellaneous journal which
Thomas Staunton wrote during 1831-1837. This
book contains scattered entries for 1831-1836,

 

drafts of letters (mostly 1835), and more than
seventy clippings (1832-1837). The entries (1831
1832) in the first half of the volume relate
primarily to Staunton's opinions and parliamentar
record on reform measures, especially the Reform

Bill of 1832. a

The entry for July 18, 1831, has a list of nine-
teen votes which Staunton made in the House of
Commons on reform issues between March and Aug.
1831, and includes the reasons for each vote.
Several entries concern Staunton's opinions on
British-Chinese relations (pp. 37, 101-107).
Staunton sharply criticized the actions of Williag
John Napier, Ninth Baron Napier, whose attempts
in 1834 at Canton to break the custom of indirect
correspondence between the factory and the Chines
officials caused a temporary cessation of trade.

Other items in this journal are a list of Staun-
on's correspondence (Oct., 1833-Oct. 1834), a

for Feb.-Mar., 1834 (p. 133), an outline of a
peech of Sir Robert Peel, Second Baronet (Sept.

Staunton is in London when he writes on Nov.

(1746-1823), Chairman of the East India Com-
pany. The dispatch of a diplomatic mission
from London to Peking, China, is under con-
sideration, and Staunton presents in detail’
his recommendations for it. Recently British
troops occupied Macao, and Staunton views the
principal object of the mission to be assur-
ance to the Chinese that London did not author-

He sent to the Society two extracts which are
translations from the Peking Gazette by John
Francis Davis that originally accompanied the
letter. Staunton discussed the content of the
two extracts. One extract concerned the Chinese
reaction to the war between Britain and Burma.

Staunton Woolen Factory. Papers, 1850-1866.
Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia

 

The name of the company appears as "S W
Factory" in a statement on the cover of the
ledger and as "Staunton Woolen Factory" in
the Thomas P. and John B. Eskridge, Ledger E,
1854, p. 32. There were a number of

proprietors as evidenced by the statement on
the ledger's cover that recorded the sale of
the factory in 1863.

The two account books record the factory's

operations in some detail. These volumes are
the Ledger, 1850-1863, and a multi-columned
Journal, 1852-1863.

An entry for 94500 on the last page of the
Journal is for “Benjamin Crawford's services
as Agent in conducting the Factory from Jany.
53 to Jany 1/63 at $450" a year. Apparently
he managed the woolen mill. There is a letter
of 1866 addressed to Benjamin Crawford that
may or may not relate to the factory.
