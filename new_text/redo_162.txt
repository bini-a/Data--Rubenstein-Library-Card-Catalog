William Christie Benet was a native of Scot-
land. He settled in Abbeville, S. C., where he
became a prominent lawyer. In 1894, he colla-
borated with Washington Augustus Clark in
writing a memorial to be presented to Congress

to protest the extension of the power of the
U. S. courts. A copy of the memorial is in the
Benjamin R. Tillman, Jr. MSS. in this department,

Major QO. Bennet commanded troops guarding
the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad in Ohio.
Bennet and his troops are not listed in the
twelve-volume official register of Ohio troops
in the Civil War. Perhaps Bennet's men were

from the local militia serving short terms to
protect the railway in the early stages of the
war before regular troops were sufficiently
numerous in Ohio. Several orders in this

 
Bennet, O.

 

volume are concerned with the dissolution of
companies whose periods of service have

terminated.

Bennet also commanded Camp Putnam in Ohio.
His order book contains special and general
orders deploying troops whose main concern
was the railroad.

The collection contains a letter dated July

19 and 22, 1808, from Thomas Dillon to Major
Peter Bennet. Dillon says he has several horses
he would like to sell for cash. He describes
the horse trading business in North Carolina

and adjacent states and indicates that in
place of cash he would consider trading the
horses for a "negro or negroes" that he would
then sell. The letter was probably written

This manuscript volume of 1849-1866 contains
more than one type of records, but it was pri-
marily used as a daybook (39 pp.) for the
Hamilton Steam Mill during Feb., 1854, to Jan.,
1857. It operated both as a sawmill and a flour

mill, On page one there is also a list of hands
working in Staton Swamp. Near the end of the
volume there is an account for equipment pur-
chased in 1849,

More than one person owned the mill, for there

 
Bennett, Bryant 2

is a reference in July, 1855, to "the land we
bought." Legal papers of 1851 in the Bryant
Bennett Papers apparently relate to this sawmill,
the only one currently known to have been located
at Hamilton at that time. One document is the
agreement of May 30, 1851, whereby Samuel Cooper

 

Benjamin and Jesse P, Parker became partners for
the building of a steam sawmill on the Roanoke
River near Hamilton. A deed and indenture of
May 13, 1851, also concern the sawmill.

There are also accounts for the estates of
these persons: Henry Mitchell, 1863-1866 (12 pp)

 
Bennett, Bryant 3

 

James Salsbury, 1865 (12 pp.); and Miss Martha
Skiles, 1865 (2 pp.). Their property is item-
ized, and Mitchell's accounts include the hiring
of slaves. Bryant Bennett was an executor or
administrator of the Mitchell and Salsbury
estates, and his collection includes financial
papers about them. These circumstances indicate
that this volume was once part of Bennett's
papers,

The volume is a diary (94 pp.) that records
the experiences of Lt. Col. Frank T. Bennett
of the 16th and later the 55th Regiment of
Pennsylvania Volunteers as a prisoner of war in

Confederate prisons in Charleston and Columbia,
S.C., from March 18 to October 10, 1862. There
is also an entry about his capture and impri-
sonment during May 16-Oct. 8, 1864. The volume
begins with a series of poems, and there are a

 
Bennett, Frank T. 2
few poems interspersed in the body of the diary
In one entry Bennett says he is writing poetry
on the wall of his prison in Columbia.

The item consists of several loose pages that
had been inserted into the volume. It is a
family member's brief chronology of major events
of the war and in the military service of

 

Frank and Horace C. Bennett. Horace may have
been Frank's brother. See Samuel P. Bates,
History of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-5, for
verification of Bennett's name and service

 

record.

 
Bennett, Frank T. 3

According to the biographical information
on Frank given at the end of the chronology, he
had been in Europe for two years and had studied
French and German writings on the science of
war. From talking with his fellow students at
the University of Leipzig, reading continental

 

and British newspapers and American newspapers
he regarded as disloyal, he returned from
Europe certain that war between the North and
South was inevitable. He learned that England
and France, so the account states, much desired

 
Bennett, Frank T.

 

the dismemberment of the Union.

Immediately after President Lincoln called
for 75,000 volunteers, Frank and Horace Bennett
raised a company in Minersville. It was named
the Schuylkill Guards, with Frank as captain
and Horace as first lieutenant. On Apr. 20,

1861, Frank was commissioned by Governor Curtin
as captain of Co. K, 16th Regt. of Pennsylvania
Volunteers. In May, 1861, Frank was promoted

to major and Horace as captain by the governor.
Horace went home on a short furlough and raised

 
Bennett, Frank T. 5

 

another company that was mustered in as Co. E,
55 Regt. of Pa. Vols. He was made captain of
the company. On Oct. 10, 1862, the chronology
records that Frank had just reached Philadel-
phia from Columbia Prison via Libby Prison,
having been paroled. On Oct. 16, Horace's

death in the Battle of Pocotaligo, S.C., the
return of his body, and its burial are noted,
The chronology also records on July 2, 1863,
the reaction (said to be favorable) of many
"Copperheads" in Schuylkill to the news that

 
Bennett, Frank T. 6 |

 

the Confederates had entered Pennsylvania and
might raid that area, the wounding and capture
of Frank Bennett during the Battle of Drewry's
Bluff in May, 1864, the local reaction to Lee's
surrender at Appomattox, and the reception on
Apr. 15, 1865, of the news of the assassination

of President Lincoln.

The first diary entry is dated Mar. 18, 1862
and Frank Bennett is in the Charleston jail.
He begins by describing how he came to be cap-
tured on Tyke Island, South Carolina. Since

 
Bennett, Frank T.

 

he was a well educated gentleman, his diary

not only contains a good description of life in
prison for him and the men serving under him
who were also captured, but it also reveals a
remarkable attitude on his part toward most of
his captors and Southerners in general. Most

of the Southern officers with whom he had con-
tact he considered gentlemen. He also spoke
of the good and courteous service a Dr. Green
gave him in the prison at Columbia. Some of
the prison guards, though, he found to be

 
Bennett, Frank T. 8

ignorant and brutish. He had only praise for
Colonel John Cunningham, who was in charge of
transporting him and his fellow prisoners from
Tyke Island to Charleston, General Nathan Georg¢d
Evans, and Colonel (later General) John Smith
Preston, who had charge of the prison in Colum-

 

bia. Time and again he mentions the unfailing
courtesy of Preston and his actions, as far as
his strict orders would permit, to make prison
life more bearable for Bennett and his men.

A number of times he records how well he likes

 
Bennett, Frank T.

 

Southerners, but knows how woefully wrong they
are in trying to dissolve the Union. He is
impressed by the earnestness and fighting
spirit of the Southerners and at times expres-
ses doubts that they can be defeated, and if
they are, it will take a long time, so he con-

tends. Twice he speaks of how he hates the
abolitionists and admits he has a prejudice
against New Englanders. Once he records that
he has never opposed slavery and is not con-
vinced that the slaves are discontented with

 
Bennett, Frank T.

 

their way of life. He considers their lot far
superior to that of the white paupers of New
England.

The aspects of prison life that Bennett
mentions most often in his diary are: poor
sanitary conditions, food, mental vacuity, lack

of sufficient physical exercise, longing to be
with his wife Lizzie and their children, ill-
ness of himself and other prisoners, harshness
of some of the prison guards, uncertainty as

to the length of his confinement, scarcity of

 
Bennett, Frank T,. 11

 

news and the unreliability of it, disciplining
of men in his former military unit, concern
about the way the North is waging the war and
dealing with the exchange of prisoners with the
South and shortage of money. Lincoln he re-
gards as a conservative wartime leader.

Bennett describes the release of himself and
his men from the Columbia prison on Oct. 7,
1862, their trip north via Charleston, Raleigh,
and Weldon to Richmond. There they took an
oath never to aid the enemies of the Confedera

 
Bennett, Frank T. l2

again. He was then paroled. The next entry

records that he is at home. The entry after

that one and the last one records his capture
at Drewry's Bluff during May, 1864, and his

confinement in Libby Prison from May 16 to Oct.
8, 1864.

The four letters by two New York Herald re-
porters to their editor James Gordon Bennett
contain significant Civil War news. The repor-
ters, L. A. Whiteley and Hiram Calkins, were

 

both reporting from Washington, Whiteley in
1862 and Calkins in December, 1864, and Feb-
ruary, 1865.

On April 20, 1862, Whiteley reports on the
advance of Generals Nathaniel P. Banks and John

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872)

C. Fremont toward Fredericksburg and the possi-
ble fate of Richmond if their forces should join
those of General Irwin McDowell, and if those
three units reached General Ambrose E. Burnside
to the south. He visualized those united for-
ces bottling up all of the Confederate forces

 

in that area on the Peninsula and thereby exe-
cuting General George B. McClellan's original
plan of defeating them all in one decisive
battle. He felt that if this were not done
Washington would be left to the mercy of the

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872)
Confederate Army. In telling Gordon how he has
obtained news he has forwarded to him he makes
reference to censorship.

Whiteley's letter of October 5 reports on the
anxiety as to whether President Lincoln's visit
to General McClellan would result in his re-

 

moval as head of the Army of the Potomac, chief-
ly as the result of his failure to attack the
Confederates during their retreat after the
Battle of Antietam; the statements by all of
McClellan's corps commanders that none of them

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872) 4°

 

was in condition to renew the fighting immed-
iately following the Antietam victory; that
next to Winfield Scott he was the greatest gen-
eral in the U.S. Army; and the impression of
some who accompanied Lincoln that McClellan
would resign if the President forced him to re-

main under General Henry W. Halleck.

Whiteley said he was inclined to believe tha
the President's visit with McClellan would re-
sult at least in the appointment of McClellan
as Commander-in-Chief, in which position Hallec

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872) 5
was only a "cypher," if not also in replacing
Edwin M. Stanton with General Banks or one of
the "fighting Generals such as Hooker or Burn-
side to command the Army of the Potomac."
Calkins reports on December 22, 1864, that
Commodore David Dixon Porter complained to the
Department of the Navy about General Benjamin
F. Butler being sent in command of the land
forces in an unidentified expedition led by
Porter. Calkins has heard that General Sherman
is planning to take Charleston by surprise be-

 

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872)

fore he attacks Savannah, and that General Grant
has decided to get rid of Butler and that many
think this is the reason such a small force,

only 7000 men, half of them blacks, was alloca-
ted to him for the expedition. Also reported

in this letter is the dispute as to whether Sher-

 

man will be brought to Richmond with his force
or remain on the coast, the former idea said to
be the preference of Grant, who wished to cap-
ture Richmond as soon as possible, but the Ad-
ministration preferred a plan for taking Rich-
mond Six or nine months later. A decision on

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872)

that matter he expected in a day or two.
Calkins's letter of February 23, 1865, men-

tions a possible move by General Lee from Rich-

mond to unite with Generals Beauregard and Hardee

to do battle with Sherman below Raleigh. He says

that unless this is done within a few days it

 

will be futile since General Schofield with some
24,000 troops is to join Sherman's army near
Raleigh and that would bring Sherman's force up
to 100,000, with which he quotes Sherman as say-
ing he could "whip the combined rebel armies."

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872) 8
Grant, he says, declares it is too late for Lee
to leave Richmond, he has learned from a letter
sent from Richmond by "underground mail" that
the Confederate Government in Richmond has al-
ready begun to evacuate to Lynchburg. He re-
ports that Robert Todd Lincoln has joined Grant’
staff before the inauguration, so Mrs. Lincoln

 

has told him, in order to be sure of being with
Grant when he captured Richmond. He says he
spent the previous Sunday evening at the White
House and then tells at length the President's

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872) 9°:

 

story during that visit about how a spy of
foreign birth who had worked as a civil engi-
neer out of Columbia, South Carolina, surveying
for railroads, had convinced him and Grant of
his sincerity in support of the Union cause and
of Grant sending him on to Sherman and his ser-

ving as Sherman's guide through the Carolinas.
Caskins then moves on to political matters. He
says that William P. Fessenden is manipulating
to try to get the nomination for President in
1868, and repeats the rumor that Senator James

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872) LO *

 

Harlan of Iowa was to become Secretary of the
Interior since Robert Lincoln was courting his
daughter and Mrs. Lincoln was doing all she
could to encourage the courtship (they were
married in 1868). Rumor also had it that Han-
nibal Hamlin was to become Secretary of the

Navy, Hugh McCulloch to be appointed Secretary
of the Treasury, and that General Singleton and
Judge Hughes had started for Richmond the day
before as peace commissioners. Judge Hughes,
Calkins understood, was one of Lincoln's most

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872) 11

 

confidential men. He had heard that Singleton
and Hughes had been sent to keep Francis P.
Blair quiet, Blair insisting that he could win
peace in forty-eight hours and was planning to
blast William H. Seward, charging him with
breaking up the negotiations with the Confed-

erates. Blair had gone unofficially to Rich-
mond to confer with Jefferson Davis in 1864.

He proposed peace on the basis of a joint effor
to be made by the North and the South to expel
Maximilian from Mexico. Calkins reports that

 
Bennett, James Gordon (1795-1872) £2
Seward is said to be planning to tell the pub-
lic that by recognizing Maximilian he secured

the opposition of Napoleon III to the "Jeff
Davis government."

Logbook (112 pp.) of the U.S. revenue cutter
Henrietta for the period of July 26, 1861, to
February 18, 1862. James Gordon Bennett, Jr.,
was a lieutenant in command of the ship. It

operated off the eastern coast of the United
States, and was lying in the harbor of Beaufort,
S.C., when the log ended.

The Henrietta was operated by the U.S.
Revenue-Cutter Service, a division of the Trea-

sury Department and not > of the U.S. Navy.

 
Bennett, James Gordon 2

 

Revenue cutters were armed vessels employed to
rf enforce revenue laws, prevent smuggling, etc.
While patrolling the eastern coast from New
England to the South, the Henrietta intercepted
and seized on Aug. 13, 1861, a British ship out
of Wilmington, N.C., thus including participa-
tion in the blockade of the Confederacy with
other duties.

Charles Bennitt was the brother of James
Bennitt - owner of the Bennitt House in Durhan,
N. C., the building in which General Joseph E.
Johnston surrendered to General William T.
Sherman at the end of the Civil War. The core

of this collection of 42 items consists of
eighteen letters from the period 1872-1887
written to Charles Bennitt and his wife Sophia
from Griffin Dodd and his wife Nancy, of Poplar

 
Bennitt, Charles hie 2
Springs, Henderson County, Tennessee, Written
at intervals of usually six months to a year,
these letters concern primarily family and per-
sonal matters. Almost all of them, however,
contain fairly illuminating news about the agri-
cultural situation in Henderson County, | Tennessee
- information about how good the season's cotton

 

or corn crop is, the prices for produce and
livestock, the amount of money in circulation,
the farmers' debt burdens, the general condition
of the farmer at the time, These letters were

 
Bennitt, Charles 3
written in the Dodds’ old age, and they some-
times provide a glimpse as to the kind of life
they led, the kind of things they were concerned
about. There are a few comments, for example,
on local and national politics and on the local
church,

There are several other items in the collec-

 

tion, most of which seem to be of lesser value,
Most of the materials after 1887 center around
William B. Bennitt - the brother of Charles.

Included in the collection are William's death

 
Bennitt, Charles 4
certificate and will from 1904; a document from
1892 certifying him to be a pensioner; and a
share in the N. C. Farmers’ State Alliance
Business Agency Fund dated 1890, There are two
letters dated 1896 to Permelia Bennitt (possibly
William's daughter) from her fiancé. After 1904,
the few remaining items apparently center around

 

Herbert Bennitt, who may have been a son of
Charles or William. Among these items are a
receipt for local taxes, some hospital and
funeral bills, and a copy of a lease on a sewing

 
Bennitt, Charles 5
machine from the Singer Sewing Machine Company.

It might be noted that in several cases the
family name is spelled "Bennett" rather than
"Bennitt," and that the family members were not
consistent on this point.

The James Bennitt Papers are those of the
owner of the Bennitt House where General Sherman
received the surrender of the Confederate ar-
mies under General Joseph E. Johnston. On the
old road between Raleigh and Greensboro and near

the HN. ¢,.8, Bx, Bennitt's farm was the meeting
place of the two armies in April, 1865. For the
restoration of the Bennitt House these manu-
scripts are invaluable. They also give a pic-
ture of life in Orange County in the section now

 
Bennitt, James, Ps

 

included in Durham County from 1830 to 1850.

The Bennitts as a family probably came into
the Cape Fear River valley sometime about 1731,
and settled on the northwest branch of the ri-
ver, They continued to hold land in Pa, (See
J. Bryan Grimes, Abstract of N, C. Wills, 1690-
1760. Raleigh, 1910, p. 386). Their family
names were John, James, and Richard,

James Bennitt (ca. 1800-1877) was evidently
from Chatham County, according to an 1829 pro-
missory note. Marriage records in Hillsborough
and local tradition indicate that he married in

 

 
Bennitt, James, a

 

1831 Nancy (Leigh) Pearson, the widow of Richard
Pearson. Nancy Leigh was from the old Pickett
Road south of Durham. The tax receipts for. land
in James Bennitt's papers begin in 1833. James
and William Bennitt are mentioned on a business
paper in 1834.

The bills and receipts of the papers show the

usual number of promissory notes common to this
period. They also include receipts for 1837-
1841 for the Saturday Chronicle, published in
Pennsylvania,for the he Hillsboro Recorder, and for
the Universe. James Bennitt's expense accounts

 

 
Bennitt, James,

frequently mention newspaper and postage items,
He bought 200 numbers of “Bible history," 2 tes-
taments, and a geography and spelling books, al-
manacs, and a cook book (25 cents in Jan. 1846).
After the Civil War James Bennitt was one of the
subscribers (1873) to the Weekly Tobacco Plant,
one of the early Durham newspapers.

 

Bennitt evidently had business dealings in
both Orange (Hillsboro) and Chatham (Chapel
Hill) counties in the 1830's, but with the 1840s
his concerns center in his own neighborhood.

His papers form a roster of the early Durham

 
5.
community. The names of James Rigsbee; Eliza-

beth Hackney, Francis and Willis >. John
Hutchins) Bingham, Spencer, Edward, and Martha
Leigh) and Henderson Owen and Zachariah Herndon
appear @n his billsand receipts in the early
years. On Jan, 29, 1834, James Bennitt paid
John W. McGee $7.00 as part of the rent due on

 

the Hogan Plantation. (The Hogan family was prom
inent in early Orange County history.)

The volumes included with the Bennitt Papers
are small but also contain valuable references
to early Durham, It is notable that the records

 
Bennitt, James,

 

for the period 1830-1850 are good, but the Ben-
nitt Papers contain little for the '50's and
nothing for the 1860's.

James Bennitt's accounts were kept in small
volumes. He bought his first "pocket book" at
Hillsborough in 1823.°. Little is’,
noted in this paper booklet except payments on

the large debt that Bennitt contracted -$400
borrowed from James Pattergson, Feb. 18, 1846,
a loan which he repaid gradually over a period
of seven years. On Oct. 11, 1854, he suddenly
made a large final payment of $230. 60.

 
Bennitt, James, 7

 

Of note are his 160 page expense diary, 1839
to 1849, and his muster roll, dated March 8,
1845.

As orderly sergeant ofa militia company,
part of the Hillsborough fegiment, formed at
William Trice's store in Orange County, Bennitt
kept the muster roll. Capt. bLavid Vickers and
lst Lieutenant William Carlton headed this
company. This roll is a valuable list of
residents of southern Durham County from 1845
to the Civil War, Family tradition states
that James Bennitt drew a line

 
Bennitt, James, 8
through the names of those killed in the Civil
War. This is open to question. Most probably
he struck off the roll the names of those drop-
ping out of the regiment during the years, ad-
ding names of new members. His son, Lorenzo
Leigh Bennitt, and his son-in-law, Robert Duke,
are listed. But Robert Duke's name appeared

 

twice, the first time crossed off and the second
time not crossed off. Washington Duke was also
a member of this militia company.

The small leather-bound expense book covers
the years 1839 to 1849, but a note dated 1820

 
Bennitt, James, 9

 

appears on page.4, This little book gives an ex-
cellent picture of country life in the Durham
section of Orange County in the forties. James
Bennitt (See deeds in Hillsborough court house)
bought the Bennitt place in 1838, and thus this
account book tells much of life there. The Ben-
nitts evidently made men's clothing and shoes in
the winter months and farmed in the summer, Dr,
Bartlett Durham not only bought his chickens
from the BennittPlace but had his half vests,
half coats, and trousers made by James Bennitt
or his wife, or by both. The family bought sole

 
Bennitt, James, 10

 

leather, sides of leather, shoe thread, button
and tacks and nails. They sold corn, meal, fod-
der, plugs of tobacco, cucumbers, peas, potatoes
watermelons, musk melons, chickens, butter, and
some pork and cotton. Items of clothing such as
parasols, bonnets, combs, suspenders, and vari-
ous kinds of cloth were purchased. Household

items such as crockery, tumblers, jugs, chairs,
beds, and desks are noted. Miss Jane Nelsonws
the community milliner; Thomas White was the

blacksmith. The Bennitts called Dr, James for
illness in 1848. Willis Dillard was one of the

 
Bennitt, James, pa

 

businessmen with whom Bennitt dealt. The Trices
and Stephen More kept general stores,

In 1844 Berhitt made notations of shares (pre
sumably in an estate) for members of his family
(p. 53) and referred (p. 42) to his interest in
the estate of "R. Bennitt, decd." This list is
probably the only one in existence of the Ben-
nitt family.

In 1845 illness visited the Bennitt Place.
May, 1847, saw the sale of 50 acres of Bennitt's
land (p. 97). At this time he notes giving
lodging and meals to travellers, On Jan, 19,

 
Bennitt, James, i?

 

1849, he “entertained” school girls and boys and
hauled luggage to Hillsboro for $5.50.

A short legder dated in the 1850's contains
the name of Alfonso J, Bennitt, a son born on
May 2, 1836. James Lorenzo Bennitt and Uberty
Jane Bennitt wrote in this ledger. They were
grandchildren, born to son Lorenzo Leigh Bennitt
and his wife Martha (Shields) Bennitt. (Genea-
logy Chart.) This ledger is something of a mys-
tery in that the names in it are not those com-
monly found in Orange County. ,In it is a list
of furniture and farm animals gn Bennitt's frend

 
Bennitt, James, 13
which were purchased some time after 1855.

In the late 1840's James Bennitt begins to
note s@les of whiskey and brandy as part of his
income. In 1870 he notes in the short ledger a
purchase of 55 gallons of brandy. By 1876 he
contracts with the Leighs to farm his land on a
share basis.

 

An almanac for 1873 is used for notes. He
mentions Dr. Vickers and M. A. Angier's store.
Hampton Patterson was employed by the day on the
farm. The expense accounts abruptly end in
1877, about the time James Bennitt sold land,

 
Bennitt, James, 14

 

Certainly he must have died about this time.

The miscellaneous papers are evidently those
of Eliza (Bennitt) Duke Christopher. She saved
valentines from the, 1850's. A small hand-made
book of hymn tunes Af%g is PpesuoésytyAdaks, An
interesting essay On t&ble manners is included.
Eliza Bennitt married Robert Duke in 1861. This

brother of Washington Duke was killed in the
last days of the fighting at Petersburg in 1868.
(See genealogy chart.)

At the end of the papers is a group of ma-
terials dealing with the subsequent history of

 
Bennitt, James, 15

 

the Bennitt House. A copy of the 1731 will from
the "Northwest branch of Cape Fear River" is in-
cluded. Paul's History of Durham gives 1880 de-
tails. On March 3, 1893, the Durham papers car-
ried a short article, "Notable Relics," in which
the candle stand, table, and whiskey bottle from
the Bennitt House are mentioned, as well as an
attempt by B. L. Duke to sell the house.

Various invitations, clippings, and programs
from Nov. 8, 1923, concern the dedication of the
monument and presentation of the Bennitt land to
the State of N. C. On May 7, 1945, Joseph

 
Bennitt, James, 16

 

Johnston Duke, Bennitt's grandson, made a depo-
sition concerning the correctness of an oil
painting of the Bennitt Place painted by Tom
Winfield Gore. Mr. Duke, then eighty, related
some details of his family and its house (From
the Alice Baldwin MSS.). A map compiled by
Allan B, Markham, Sr., of Durham shows ownership

of the land 1790-1810 to be by Issac Henderson
and Benjamin Carroll. Various clippings and

programs on the restoration and the dedication
ceremonies for Apr. 29, 1962, conclude the pa-

pers.

Benson-Thompson Family. Papers, 1803-1936.
Marion, Perry County, Alabama.

 

Members of the related Benson, Moore, and
Thompson families moved to Alabama from the
region of Greenville and Spartanburg, South

Carolina. In Alabama several men achieved
prominence. Nimrod Earle Benson was a legisla-

tor, mayor of Montgomery, and receiver of public
moneys in the Alabama land office. John Ford
Thompson was a brigadier general in the state
militia. Andrew Barry Moore was governor for
two terms, 1857-1861. The collection consists
primarily of the personal correspondence and

 
Benson-Thompson Family 2
business papers of the Bensons and Thompsons

and includes a small group of items for the
Moores. However, there is considerable official
correspondence among commanders of the militia
during 1836-1840. The families in both Alabama
and South Carolina are represented. The papers
have a wide chronological distribution, but they

 

are more extensive for the period of the 1820's
through the 1860's.

Dr. Elias Benson (1788-1843) was a native of
Spartanburg District, S. Carolina, from which he
and two brothers, Abner (d. 1836) and Nimrod
Earle (1794-1854), moved to Alabama early in the

 
Benson-Thompson Family 3

 

1800's. Another brother, Williss, remained in
South Carolina. Elias Benson was at Marion at
least by 1821 when the first letter of the col-
lection is addressed to him there. A biograph-
ical sketch of Nimrod Earle Benson appears in
Thomas McAdory Owen, History of Alabama and
Dictionary of Alabama Biography (Chicago, 1921),

 

 

I, 133-134. In the Miscellany there is an
envelope for some Benson genealogy.

The correspondence and other papers of the
1820's and 1830's are especially extensive for
Elias Benson and his relatives in Alabama and
South Carolina. Elias and Abner Benson have

 
Benson-Thompson Family 4
numerous letters, and Williss and Nimrod Earle
Benson are also represented, especially in the
1830's. Nimrod E. Benson's letters are listed
in the Autograph file. Numerous relatives are
represented either by letters, business or legal
papers, and comments.

The correspondence usually concerns personal

 

and business matters, but several notable ex-
ceptions relate to politics in South Carolina
and a manufacturer and politicians in Alabama.
On Dec. 5, 1831, Andrew Barry Moore (d. 1847 or
1848), cousin of Gov. Andrew Barry Moore of
Alabama, writes from South Carolina about the

 
Benson-Thompson Family

 

nullification controversy and the agitation
throughout the state by the Free Trade Associa-
tion. On July 23, 1832, Abner Benson is in
South Carolina where he comments on the politi-
cal battle between the nullifiers and their op-
ponents. Later on Jan. 15, 1835, Thomas N.
Dawkins comments from Union Court House on the

discord among the nullifiers in his county. He
notes a general approval of the late compromise
but expects the old party divisions to continue.
On Oct. 2, 1838, Williss Benson of Greenville
District, S. C., describes the circumstances of
the shooting of Richardson Earle by William

 
Benson-Thompson Family 6

 

Lowndes Yancey who was then living near Green-
ville. A number of other letters are from
either Greenville or Spartanburg. On Oct. 10,
1829, Nimrod E. Benson writes about a young
attorney who is a candidate for circuit solici-
tor. This attorney, George Thomas Goldthwaite,
later serves as Chief Justice of Alabama and
U. S. Senator.

During 1834-1835, Abner Benson in Bibb
County receives four letters from David Scott

 
Benson-Thompson Family 6-A
(1803-1868), a merchant and pioneer cotton manu-
facturer of Tuscaloosa and Bibb counties.

Scott discusses plans for the construction and
operation of a cotton factory; it is presum-
ably the cotton mill that Scott developed at
this time in Scottsville, Bibb County, for the
Tuscaloosa Manufacturing Company. See the

 

Alabama Historical Quarterly, Vol. 18, pp. 293-
294. Benson was superintendent of the Scotts-
ville cotton factory according to Ethel Armes,
The Story a Coal and Iron in Alabama (Birming-
ham, 1910), p. 72. It is also stated here

 

 

 
Benson-Thompson Family 7
that Scott built the cotton and woolen factory
in 1836.

The Bensons were closely related to the fam-
ily of Governor Andrew Barry Moore. He was a
nephew of General Thomas Moore, whose daughter
Patsy married a Benson; this is indicated by
his will. Family letters indicate that Patsy
was the wife of Dr. Elias Benson.

The early Moore family correspondence repre-
sents part of the family in Spartanburg District,
S. C., and is scattered from about 1827 into the

 

 
Benson-Thompson Family 8
mid-1830's. The most frequent correspondent is
Andrew Barry Moore* cousin of Gov. Moore of
Alabama. He writes to Charles Hamilton Moore
and to Elias Benson. Charles Moore and Thomas J.
Moore are also represented by one or more letters
A useful source for identifying the Moores is
Janie Revill, Abstract of Moore Records of South

 

 

Carolina 1694-1865 (Columbia, S. C., 1931),

pp. 35-36. Benson and Moore letters of the
1820's concern the settlement of the estate of
General Thomas Moore (1759-1822), father of

A. B. Moore of S. C. and Mrs. Benson. Gov.
Moore was a principal official of the Marion

Benson-Thompson Family 9
Steam Mill Company when it was organized in
Sept., 1836; a copy of its preliminary articles
of association is filed in the Legal Papers.
After the Civil War, Gov. Moore writes to his
son, Andrew, in 1868-1869. References to the
Moores are scattered throughout the collection.
John Ford Thompson married Mary Eleanor

 

Benson, daughter of Elias Benson. He lived at
or near Greenville, S. C., prior to his migra-
tion to Perry County. Letters are addressed to
him and his mother at Greenville in the 1820's.
He and a brother were educated at Greeneville
College in Tennessee during the mid-1820's as is

 
Benson-Thompson Family 10
noted below. By at least the mid-1830's he was
in Alabama. He engaged in farming, surveying,
and business. From 1836 to 1840, Thompson was
Brigadier General in command of the 14th Brigade
of the Alabama Militia. He died in the early
1850's. A notation about him appears in the
biographical sketch of Robert Benson Evins,

 

a grandson, in Owen's History, I, 556.

Thompson has letters and business and legal
papers throughout the first half of the 1800's,
and they become numerous by the late 1830's.
Various members of the Thompson family are rep-
resented. The most significant part of his

 
Benson-Thompson Family ll
letters concerns the Alabama Militia. He was
commissioned Brigadier General of the 14th
Brigade on Oct. 17, 1836, and his commission is
filed in the Miscellany. Thompson held this
position until his resignation was accepted by
Governor Arthur P. Bagby on Sept. 26, 1840. Dur
ing 1836-1840 the correspondence relates to var-
ious aspects of the militia and includes letters
from a number of superior and subordinate offi-
cers.

The militia code is commented upon by several
high officers, Major General John C. Pickens
commanded the 3rd Division of which Thompson's

 

 
Benson-Thompson Family a.
14th Brigade was a part. On July 25, 1837,
General Pickens comments on his progress in
organizing the militia. A committee of the
legislature has asked his advice about a militia
code, and he proposes the adoption of the South
Carolina code, the best system in the country.
On Jan. 28, 1839, James G. Carroll, Adjutant and
Inspector General of Alabama, reports that no
material change has been made in the law. Later
on May 2, George B. Clitherall remarks on his
and General Pickens's favorable reaction to the
recent modifications of the militia code. Late
in 1839 the legislature is considering the code

 

 
Benson-Thompson Family 14
Phelan, Speaker of the Alabama House of Repre-
sentatives. On March 25, Carroll explains why
the southern Alabama brigades have encampments
in the spring and the northern brigades in the
fall. Some volunteer corps in the 3rd Division
are chartered companies, and on June 6, General
Pickens explains how he intends to settle the

 

controversy about their chain of command. On
Sept. 1, George Clitherall approves Thompson's
determination to exact from the independent
companies a strict compliance with their char-
ters. On April 18, Col. Simeon Maxwell offers
an explanation for the lack of interest in

 
Benson-Thompson Family 15

 

mustering the local militia. In the Miscellany
there are several rosters for the 19th and 38th
Regiments of the 14th Brigade. Along with the
rosters there are annual returns of the 32nd
Regiment (undated) and of the 44th Regiment for
1838 and 1839.

A military convention at Tuscaloosa is pro-

posed by General George W. Crabb, a prominent
Whig politician, on Nov. 8, 1838. This conven-
tion would assemble during the session of the
legislature, and it would serve as a show of
force to the states’ "peculiar population" who
can only be kept under control "by a continual

 
Benson-Thomvson Family 16
sense of superior phisical power ready to act
against them."

Encampments are a frequent topic of letters
and orders. For example, on March 25, 1839,
General Carroll details orders for the spring
encampments of the southern brigades. In sev-
eral letters of 1839-1840, George B. Clitheral1l,
a merchant in Greensboro, discusses the making
of tents and marquees for the next encampment of
the 14th Brigade. On April 30, 1839, General
Pickens notes the problem of providing equipment
for the brigades.

Other letters concern such topics as courts-

 

 
Benson-Thompson Family 17
martial, the election and resignation of office
encampments, equipment, and routine matters.
Various brigades and regiments are represented.
There are several copies of courts-martial pro-
ceedings in the Miscellany along with the commis
sion for a captain in the 14th Brigade.

In August of both 1849 and 1850, John F.
Thompson visits Talladega Springs because of bad
health. He comments upon the accommodations and
the company at this resort.

On June 9, 1846, Thomas Benson discusses the
raising of volunteer companies in Perry County
for the Mexican War. Recruitment is proceeding

 

 
Benson-Thompson Family 13
again, and on Dec. 22, General Pickens criticiz-
es the proposed changes and the manner in which
the legislators are proceeding. On Dec. 23,
Adjutant General Carroll contends that the legi
lature's frequent changes in the code are a
principal cause for the militia not being better
organized.

Several letters concern aspects of militia
organization. On Dec, 23, 1839, General Carroll
discusses the past and present effectiveness of
the militia, its expected future development,
and the present need for financial appropria-
tions. His letter is addressed to John Dennis

 

 
Benson-Thompson Family 18
slowly despite the considerable effort in its
behalf.

Although there are only a few scattered sold-
iers' letters, the Civil War is well represented
on the home front by the letters of Mrs. John F.
Thompson. Letters are numerous for the early
years and scarce later on. Mary Eleanor (Benson
Thompson writes to two sons and a brother, and
her letters are interesting for their descrip-
tion of life in wartime Marion. Her reaction to
the secession crisis of 1860-1861 appears in
letters to son Elias at the University of Alabam

The Thompsons attended St. Wilfred's Episcopa

 

 
Benson-Thompson Family 19
Church at Marion, and Mrs, Thompson's letters
have comments upon it and the rector and bishop.
There are several letters of 1859-1863, and one
of 1907 from W. A. Stickney, rector at St.
Wilfred's. On Nov. 15, 1860, Mrs. Thompson states
her reaction as an Episcopalian to the secession
crisis.

 

The young Bensons and Thompsons were educated
at various colleges and universities which are
represented in this collection.

During 1823-1826, John F. Thompson and his
brother, Beverly J. Thompson, attended Greene-
ville College in Greeneville, Tennesse. Presi-

 
Benson-Thompson Family 20

 

dent Charles Coffin signs certificates for them
on Nov. 19, 1823, and April 26, 1825. Coffin
also writes a letter to their mother on Nov. 20,
1823. There are four letters to Thompson from
student colleagues: April 21, Aug. 20, 1825;
Dec. 8, 1826; Dec. 11, 182_. Among the Bills
and Receipts there is an itemized account of

John and Beverly Thompson's school expenses,
Aug. 7, 1823-Sept. 29, 1826. In the Miscellany
there are two large fragments of Beverly Thomp-
son's diploma of 1826. Greeneville College
merged with Tusculum College in 1868.

In the 1840's Thomas M. Benson went to the

 
Benson-Thompson Family 2
University of Nashville. He writes three
letters from there on April 23, Sept. 10, 1843,
and Aug. 25, 1844. On July 23, 1842, President
Philip Lindsley discusses the charges for tui-
tion and board. On Aug. 13, 1846, Prof. Nathan-
jel Cross discusses a tutorship and several
members of the university's staff. On Aug. 25,

 

1844, Benson notes the excitement in Nashville
over the presidential campaign. On Aug. 22 he
sat on the stand during a speech by the Whig ora
tor, Seargent S. Prentiss, and he describes the
audience's reaction and Prentiss's near exhaus-

tion.

 
Benson-Thompson Family 22
Elias Benson Thompson, son of John F,.
Thompson, graduated from the University of
Alabama in 1861. During 1859-1861 he writes
several letters, and his career is reflected in
an extensive series of letters from his mother
at Marion. Reaction to the secession crisis is
often expressed in these letters. On March 7,
1860, President Landon Cabell Garland writes to
Mrs. Thompson about her son's progress. Luke
White Dugger, a graduate of 1861, describes a
commencement week's activities; the date may be
July 24, 1860. Thompson's quarterly report of
Jan. 17, 1861, from the University is filed with

 

 
Benson-Thompson Family rae
the Bills and Receipts.

After the Civil War, Elias Thompson studied
medicine which he later practiced at Marion.
His medical degree was from the University of
Louisiana at New Orleans. Elias writes a series
of letters from medical school from Nov., 1866,
to Feb., 1867, and three letters of Jan.-Feb.,
1868. He comments on the Medical Department and
its professors. In the Miscellany there are
eight admission cards for courses during 1866-
1867. The University of Louisiana is now Tulane
University.

A three-page inventory of a private medical

 

 
Benson-Thompson Family 24
library at Marion in 1867 appears in the back of
John F. Thompson's daybook and account book,

The library may once have belonged to Dr. Elias
Benson, but at least one other relative, Edwin
Pickens Benson, was a doctor. Edwin Benson
studied at Philadelphia according to letters of
1846 that are addressed to him there. On Dec.

 

30, 1866, Elias Thompson associates this library
with his Uncle Pick, presumably Dr. Edwin Pickens
Benson. At this time Mrs. John Thompson has the
library.

Medical education is also the subject of a
letter of April 19, 1825, in which John P. Watts

 
Benson-Thompson Family 25
reflects on his career. Watts is a student of
Dr. Ramsey, physician to the Poor House and
Marion Hospital at Charleston, S. C.

The correspondence is not extensive after the
1860's and consists of letters from various
members of the family. Robert Benson Evins,
grandson of John F. Thompson and a lawyer and

 

legislator, has some personal and family letters
in the later decades.

Elias B. Thompson was an officer of Marion
Grange, No. 95, of the Patrons of Husbandry.
The Miscellany contains records of the Marion
Grange, 1873-1876. They include: six secre-

 
Benson-Thompson Family 26
tary's quarterly reports, 1874-1875; six trea-
surer's quarterly reports, 1874-1875; three
quarterly reports, 1874, 1876; and Thompson's
accounts as secretary and treasurer, 1873-1876.

John F. Thompson's diary dates from Jan. 1 to
Dec. 19, 1841, and includes a few entries for
Oct., 1844-Jan., 1845. The diary is a detailed
account of his activities and includes refer-
ences to many persons in the community.

Thompson's daybook dates from 1836 to 1840,
and the same volume includes various accounts in
ledger form that date from 1841 to 1847.

This collection contains nine items which
are signed by William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck,
Third Duke of Portland (1738-1809). Seven of
them are letters from Portland to John King,

Under Secretary of State for the Home Depart-
ment during 1792-1806. On two occasions Port=:
land mentions foreign affairs. He observes
(Jan. 6. 1803) that Napoleon's conduct would
Justify a declaration of war by Britain, but
the lack of any continental ally renders sucha
move unwise.

 
Bentinck, William Henry Cavendish; Third Duke of
Portland. 2
On Nov. 1, 1804, he again laments the absence of
strong opposition to Napoleon on the continent.
Parts of several letters relate to British poli-
tics and administration. On Sept. 30, 1802,
Portland mentions the problem of defending
Jamaica. Ina letter of Jan. 6, 1803, the Duke

 

states his suspicion of the continuance of what
appears from his letter to be a romance which
perhaps involves George III's second son,
Frederick Augustus, Duke of York and Albany. He
also states his aversion for Benthamite reform

 
Bentinck, William Henry Cavendish; Third Duke of
Portland. 2
and fears that Thomas Pelham, Second Earl of
Chichester, adhers to it. On May 10, 1804, when
Pitt forms his last ministry, Portland discusses
prospective appointments to the cabinet. On
Nov. 22, 1804, the Duke gives suggestions for

 

the form which the Lords Lieutenant of the
counties should use when they commission officer
for the Volunteer Corps. Three letters contain
references to the Irish problem. On Nov. l,
1804, the Duke argues that one penal statute
would quiet the Irish more effectively than

 
Bentinck, William Henry Cavendish, Third Duke of

many concessions, and on Nov. 22, 1804, he re-
acts favorably to some declaration which William
Pitt has made about the Roman Catholics.
Portland expresses his distrust of two prominent
Irishmen--Arthur James Plunkett, Eighth Earl of
Fingall, and John Thomas Troy, Catholic Arch-

 

bishop of Dublin (Nov. 1, 1804). On Nov. 27,
1804, the Duke gives an unflattering opinion of
John Keogh, an Irish politician, and he men-
tions Keogh's view of the inadequacy of past
concessions to the Irish.

 
Bentinck, William Henry Cavendish, Third Duke of
Portland. 5
Of the two items which are not addressed to
King, one is a bill for travel expenses (1800),
and the other is a letter of Jan. 8, 1798, in
which Portland sets the date for a report to the
King by John Fordyce, Surveyor-General of the

 

Land Revenue.

2 items added, 8-8-61. This letter of
Sept. 21, 1796, by Portland, Home Secretary,
relates to the government of the island of
Martinique in the West Inéies during the Britis
occupation. The “~e” will defray

Bentley was apparently a young Scot who
emigrated to America about 1834 and settled in
Bertie Co., N.C. Most of the letters are from
Catherine Thomson, who appears to have been a
widow whom Bentley intended to marry as soon

as he could afford to pay her passage to Amer-
lca. Most of her letters are taken up with the
failure to receive letters on the part of either
of the two. The last letter indicates that
Bentley was keeping astore in Willimston, but

there is no evidence t Mrs. Thomson ever
reached America.

Edmund Clerihew Bentley (1875-1956), British
author, was called to the Bar, Inner Temple,
1901, joined the staff of the Daily News in
1902, and worked on the staff of the Daily
Telegraph, 1912-1934, and again after 1940. He

 

was the author of detective novels and short

stories,
He attended Merton College, Oxford, and was

president of the Oxford Union Society, 1898.

 
Bentley, Edmund Clerihew 2
At Oxford he was a friend of John Buchan (later
First Baron Tweedsmuir), who became noted as

an author and as Governor General of Canada.
There are five letters from Buchan during 1897-
1899 and the 1920's. Buchan's letter of Aug. 5,
1897 [?], has brief comments on activities at
Oxford and elsewhere, On Dec. 27, 1898, he
noted Oldenshaw's illness, Bentley's refusal of
an offer, and current plans. In January, 1899,
Buchan was chosen as Isis Idol and elected
president of the Oxford Union Society. Letters

 

 
Bentley, Edmund Clerihew 4
1915 quickly followed the first, and Buchan
noted "the interminable time" since the book's
composition, The third and fourth editions were
in 1925 and 1929, and Buchan resigned from
Nelson's in the latter year.

 

 
Bentley, Edmund Clerihew

 

of January 17 and 20 include remarks about the
Idol selection and B. C. Boulter, John Gordon
Jameson, Stair Gillon, L. R. F. Oldenshaw,
Thomas Nelson, and others.

Only the last two paragraphs survive from
Buchan's undated letter in which plans for a
new edition of Bentley's Trent's Last Case

 

were related. The publisher would be Messrs.
Thomas Nelson & Sons who also wanted to handle
his next novel. The letter apparently dates
from the mid-1920's. The second edition in

First Baron Beresford. Papers, 1879-1918.
London, England

Charles William de la Poer Beresford, First
Baron Beresford (1846-1919), British admiral,
was the second son of John, Fourth Marquis of
Waterford, He was a naval cadet in 1859,
lieutenant in 1868, commander in 1875, captain
in 1882, and a rear admiral in 1897. He
served as aide-de-camp to the Queen, 1896-1897,
and to the Prince of Wales on his visit to
India, 1875-1876. His service at Alexandria
in 1882 and with Lord Wolseley's Nile

 

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 2
Expedition, 1584-1885, was distinguished. In
1886 he became a Lord Commissioner of the
Admiralty but resigned two years later because
of controversy about the strength of the fleet.
After commanding the steam reserve fleet at
Chatham (1893-1896), he visited China during
1898-1899. Thereafter he commanded several
fleets until retirement in 1911. AS a member
of the Conservative and later of the Unionist
parties, he held various seats in the House of
Commons from 1874 to 1916. His publications
include The Memoirs of Admiral Lord Charles

 

 

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 2
Beresford ... (London, 1914),

The correspondence concerns various aspects
of naval administration and includes letters
by Beresford, naval officers, and royal person-
nages. Naval strength and mobilization policy
is a recurring topic along with general remarks
about Britain’sS political leadership and the
state of the empire,

Lord Beresford's letter of July 31, 1879,
concerns his financial affairs.

On June 30, 1881, he wrote to Lord Granville,
the foreign secretary, and agreed to help with

 

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 4
the English tour of King Kalakaua of Hawaii,
and commented about the King and his past
relationship with him,

Several years later (Oct. 16, 1885), John A.
Fisher recommended Capt. Edmund Frederick
Jeffreys and articles in the Pall Mall Gazette
as sources of information about the state of

 

 

the navy and promised to send his own obser-
vations.

On May 27, 1886, Fisher, the Director of
Naval Ordnance, concerted arrangements for
Beresford's visit to Portsmouth with a group

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 5
of members of Parliament, including some who
opposed increased appropriations for the navy.
Naval officials involved were: Walter Talbot
Kerr, private secretary to the First Lord of
the Admiralty; Sir George Ommanney Willes,
the commander at Portsmouth; and Admiral
Frederick Anstruther Herbert.

 

In a letter of Feb. 13, 1890, Kaiser
Wilhelm II of Germany congratulated Beresford
on his appointment to command the cruiser
Undaunted and criticized Lord George Francis
Hamilton, First Lord of the Admiralty, and the

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 6
gun department of the British navy. The Kaiser
noted sending to Sir Anthony Hiley Hoskins,

a Lord of the Admiralty, a scheme according to
Beresford's ideas. At the same time (Feb. 14)
Herbert Bismarck thanked Beresford for his
letter and photographs and sent the letter from
the Kaiser who also promised to send his

 

portrait.

On June 10, 1892, Beresford wrote to Sir
John Pender, the pioneer of submarine tele-
graphy, from H.M.S. Undaunted in the Mediter-
ranean. He commented on a telegraph in use on

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron rd
board the ship, his scheme for securing or
destroying telegraph communications in wartime,
and his work on defense policy.

Lord Wolseley, Commander-in-Chief in Ireland
praised Beresford's intention to return to the
House of Commons, attacked cabinet ministers
in general, and expressed disdain for Dublin

 

and the society life of London and other cities
(Letter of June 12, 1894).

Beresford was commander of the steam reserve
fleet at Chatham when he ordered on Jan. 23,

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 8
1895, another unigraph from Mr. Saunders and
when he noted using a telegraph for communi-
cating with the depot.

On March 10, 1898, Beresford made a speech
in the House of Commons on the navy estimates
in which he recommended rearming the reserve
fleet. An undated letter from Prince Louis of

 

Battenberg, later Louis Mounbatten, probably
referred to this speech, Prince Louis gave his
objections to Beresford's plan for commissioning
a part of the reserve fleet and defended the

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 9
current mobilization scheme. He used stationery
with the name of the H.M.S. Majestic crossed
out. He began service on that ship in 1897

and a year later became assistant director of
naval intelligence and head of the mobilization
department. The letter probably dates from
March, 1898.

 

At about the same time (March 31, 1898),
Beresford wrote to his brother, Lord William
Leslie de la Poer Beresford, about the recent
hotly contested by-election at York in which
he had defeated Christopher Furness, First

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 10
Baron Furness,

During the Spanish-American War there was
considerable sympathy in Britain for the United
States.. On April 22, 1898, Beresford informed
Alfred S. Keen about the American refusal of
an offer from the New South Wales contingent
and noted that the Foreign Enlistment Act
forbade British citizens from aiding the
belligerents.

In Jan., 1901, Beresford commented on his
brother's death, the possibility of contesting
a seat in Parliament, Queen Victoria's impor-

 

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron Ld
tance to the empire, and the lack of strong
leaders in the government. The letter is
addressed to Richards, possibly Sir Frederick
William Richards,

In the same year (Jan. 28) he reflected on
the dangerous times ahead for the Empire and
the leadership needed to cope with them, and
he also discussed the water tube and Belleville
boilers. This is the first of a series of
letters to Thomas Douglas Murray (d. 1911), a
barrister.

On May 13, 1902, Admiral Beresford noted his

 

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 12
lack of suitable employment, the difficulty of
advancement by merit in the navy, and the
implementation of many reforms that he had
suggested,

A year leter (May 17, 1903) Lord Goschen,
recently First Lord of the Admiralty, remarked
about his recent speech on the case of Col.

 

Kinloch and the importance of loyalty and
discipline to the naval service,

On Sept. 4, 1903, George, Prince of Wales,
discussed: the recent naval maneuvers; Sir
Compton Edward Domvile, the commander in the

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 13
Mediterranean; and Domvile's aide, Sir Stanley
Cecil James Colvile. He also noted the
successful operation of Beresford's new pro-
posals in the fleet, the repairs to the
Jupiter's engines outside the dockyard, the
success of King Edward's visit to Vienna, and
his own hunting trip.

 

Meanwhile (Sept. 18, 1903), Carl Meyer,
financier, commented on the cabinet crisis and
Joseph Chamberlain's resignation and discussed
the Pekin Syndicate's railroad construction

projects in China,

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 14
Soon thereafter (Nov. 29, 1903), Sir George
Stuart White, Governor of Gibraltar, expressed
gratitude for the cooperation between
Beresford's naval forces and his army garrison.
On Jan. 2, 1904, the Prince of Wales conveyed
the King's appreciation for a naval report and
for the improvement in gunnery, congratulated

 

Beresford on the Majestic's new world record
for heavy guns and on the performance of the
other ships, and recommended his cousin,
Alexander of Battenberg, who was recently
appointed a midshipman on Beresford's ship.

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron Ee)

A month later (Feb. 19, 1904), Arthur, Duke
of Connaught and Strathearn, denied being
appointed inspector general of the forces, a
post he received soon thereafter.

On Sept. 16, 1910, the Admiral commented on
a royal visit (presumably the forthcoming trip
to India), tis own plans to issue a statement
on the condition of the navy, the lack of
support from Conservative leaders, the possi-
bility of taking an independent position or of
giving up his seat in Parliament, and the state

of the Empire,

 

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 16

Some months Later (Jan. 18, 1911), Alexander
George of Teck, later the Earl of Athlone,
wrote in behalf of the St. John's Foundation
School that benefited the education of the sons
of the poorer clergy whose economic plight he
described,

On Nov. 26, 1911, Admiral Beresford wrote
about the death of his old friend, Thomas
Douglas Murray, with whom he had long corres-
ponded about defense and the state of the
country and empire.

Two letters concern World War I. On Nov. 22

 

 
Beresford, Lord Charles, First Baron 17
1917, Beresford wrote to James William Thomas
Ley,: journalist, and stressed the war effort
of the mercantile marine. The reverse side
of this letter is covered with shorthand. On
April 2, 1918, he asked Major General Charles
Edward Lawrie about the royal naval division
that had recently distinguished itself at

the front.

l item added, 3-20-67. On Oct. 19, 1890,
Beresford commended Louis John Jennings, M.Pey
for his article on the navy and criticized the
administration of the navy and its defense
policy. He planned ‘eo election to the

House of Commons at the next opportunity.

strength.

Wilttan Beresford (1797-loo3) was a younger

son of Marcus Beresford (1764-1797), M. P. for
Dungarvan. William was educated at Eton and Ox-
ford - B.A., 1819, and M.A., 1824. From 1826
to 1830 he served as captain of the 12th Lancers
and was in Portugal in 1827. He contested the

 

parliamentary seat of Waterford in 1837 and
later was M. P. from Harwich, 1841-1847, and
from North Essex, 1847-1865. Beresford

became a privy councillor on February 27, 1852,

 
Beresford, William . 1A

 

and a day later became secretary at war, &@post
he held only until December. He died at Eccle-
ston Square, London, on October 6, 1883. This
information comes from Frederic Boase, Modern
English Biography (Truro, 1892), I, 252. A short
contemporary sketch of Beresford is in Edward
Walford, The So Families of the United
Kingdom (London, 1875), p. 78. Beresford was
an active member of the Protectionist wing of
the Conservative Party.

The principal unity of the collection is that
most of the items are apparently addressed

 

 
Beresford, William, 2
to Beresford. There are, however, never more than
four letters from the same person and seldom
more than one. Only two items (June and n.d.,
1852) contain Beresford's signature. Most of the
items are political.

Two groups of letters relate directly to
Beresford. Several letters of 1852 concern his

 

term as Secretary at War. A number of others,
mostly congratulatory, refer to a legal case
which opponents of Beresford brought against

him in 1853-1854.

Charles Edwin Bergh (d. 1876) was the son of
Christian and Elizabeth Bergh of New York City.
His father, who was of German descent, became
a noted shipbuilder. Among the ships he built

was the U. S. frigate President that was cap-
tured by the British during the War of 1812.
Edwin's brother Henry founded the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals, and he devoted much of his life to that
cause, For a sketch eo. life see the

 
Bergh, Charles Edwin

 

National Cyclopaedia of American Biography.
Christian Bergh's career is described in the
Dictionary of American Biography. No biography
of Charles Edwin Bergh could be located, but
his obituary in the New York Times of May 14,
1876, states that he died the previous day.

 

 

 

 

 

According to that account his funeral was held
in St. Mark's Church, an Episcopal church lo-
cated on Stuyvesant Street in New York City,
and he was buried in the family vault in the
Church's burial ground. Three sons, Edwin,

 
Bergh, Charles Edwin

 

Henry II, and Willie C., are listed as his sur-
vivors.

All of the letters in this collection were
written by Edwin Bergh to his parents, and they
begin with one addressed from Washington on
March 1, 1833. In this letter he reports on

debates he witnessed in Congress. He says
Henry Clay is the "most impressive and powerful
orator in the nation," and reports the passage
of Clay's compromise tariff bill in the Senate
to replace the tariff law of 1832 that South

 
Bergh, Charles Edwin 4

Carolina had nullified. He quotes remarks by
Clay about the American System that included
criticism of Senator George M. Dallas. His
comments on other Senators and Representatives
include a description of George McDuffie's
speech opposing the Force Bill that passed the

 

following day; praise of James Blair of South
Carolina, whom he referred to as the "giant who
assaulted Duff Green"; quotation of John Ran-
dolph's sarcastic remark about Mahlon Dickerson
of New Jersey; his observation of the response

 
Bergh, Charles Edwin

 

of Martin Van Buren and John C. Calhoun to each
other; and his attending with Captain Champlin
a brilliant party at the President's the even-
ing before.

Two passports of Bergh dated 1835 and 1836
reveal that at the age of thirty he was travel-

ing extensively in Europe. This was his second
trip. On Aug. 25, 1841, he writes from London
that he will soon be leaving for the Near East.
He mentions the serious differences between the
U. S. and Great Britain over the arrest and

 
Bergh, Charles Edwin 6

 

trial of Canadian Alexander McLeod that he
thinks may lead to war. He tells of a trip to
Windsor Castle where he saw Queen Victoria,
Prince Albert, and Lord Melbourne during their
regular Sunday afternoon Appearance before the
subjects who gathered at the palace. He notes

the Queen's pregnancy and the handsomeness of
Prince Albert, and reports that a person in-
volved in dismantling the President at Spithead
felt that enough of the ship was sound that she
might have been repaired.

 
Bergh, Charles Edwin 7

By Sept. 20, 1841, Bergh is in Paris, the
city he says he loves most. He writes of his
trip to Rouen, the assassination attempt on the
French Princes, the frequent attempts on the
life of Louis Philippe, and Napoleon's tomb in
the Hotel des Invalides and how it attracts

 

people each day.

The subsequent original letters and clippings
of reports to the New York Herald, Gazette, and
Eagle about his travels from the latter part of
1841 to June 7, 1843, cover his observations

 

 
Bergh, Charles Edwin 8

 

and experiences on Malta and in traveling in
Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Greece, the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, Prussia, Italy, and
Spain. The cities and sites he comments on
include Cairo, Jerusalem, Beyrout (Beirut),
Damascus, Baalbeck, Petra, Constantinople,

Corinth, Vienna, Berlin, Florence, and Naples.
While in Paris in 1841 Bergh met Davis Austen,
and they began traveling together. Whether he
accompanied Bergh on all of his travels from
1841 to 1843 is not shown. Two letters Bergh
sent home from —— and Beyrout were

 
Bergh, Charles Edwin 9
carried by the Reverend Charles Wesley Andrews,
a collection of whose papers is in this depart-
ment.

The dangers and hardships of riding camels
and horses in deserts and mountains and living
outdoors, paying for protection, encounters

 

with robbers, experiences in hiring sheiks of
different tribes to guide them on their travels
through northern Africa and the Near East, and
the arms he carried Bergh describes. He speaks
of the lawless Arabs and rivalry and fighting
among different tribes and factions, naming

 
Bergh, Charles Edwin 109

specifically the Druses and Maronites. He was
particularly attracted by ancient ruins and
visited many of the most noted sites of such
ruins. The better houses in Damascus he des-
cribed as having very plain, unimpressive ex-
teriors but very elaborate interiors.

 

While on Malta he comments particularly on
St. Paul's Church and its religious relics.
While touring many of the "holy" places in
Jerusalem and other areas of Palestine he ex-
presses skepticism about the authenticity of

some of the places and _* venerated objects.

Souvenirs that he collected on his travels con-
stitute by far the larger number of items in
this collection. In Constantinople he wit-
nessed the magnificent state procession of the
Sultan and his entourage to the Mosque of Sul-
tan Ahmed on the anniversary of the birth of

 

Mahomet. He describes this procession in de-
tail. In Constantinople he also visited a
slave market as he had earlier in Cairo, and
observed religious ceremonies that featured
performances by twirling and howling Dervishes.

 
Bergh, Charles Edwin fe

In the area of international affairs Bergh
mentions relations between Palestine and Great
Britain and the shelling of Beyrout by the
British Navy, and relations between Persia and
Russia.

These few letters are associated with the dis

Carter Burwell Berkeley of these letters was a
son of the fourth Edmund Berkeley and Mary Bur-
well. Carter B. was a member of the House of
Delegates (1810-1811) from Middlesex Co., inheri

and served in the 8th Va. Infantry during the
Civil War. Thomas E. Churchill married a

The letters are chiefly business, involving
tobacco shipments and finances. There is brief
comment on the War of 1812. The letters them-
selves have little intrinsic value.

Sir George Henry Frederick Berkeley (1785-
1857), British general, was Surveyor General
of the Ordnance, 1852, and M.P. for Devonport,
1852-1857. He was the grandson of the Fourth
Earl of Berkeley.

Three letters of 1849-1850 were written to

 

Berkeley while he was Commander-in-Chief at
Madras. The Signatures are difficult to read,
but the correspondent was probably General Sir
George Brown, Deputy Adjutant General and then
Adjutant General (1850) at the Horse Guards,

 
Berkeley, Sir George Henry Frederick 2

In the letter of April 7, 1849, the writer noted
a Mrs. Brown as he might have done his wife.

In that letter Brown discussed the Second Sikh
War in the Punjab, Sir Charles James Napier,
Lewis William Buck, M.P., and Lewis Buck of the
38th Native Infantry. Lord Grey was noted,

On Oct. 22, 1850, he wrote about Sir William
Maynard Gomm's appointment as Commander-in-
Chief in India, the reason Lord Seaton was not
offered the post, Sir John Grey's probable
appointment as Commander-in-Chief at Bombay,
and Lt. Charles Scott Elliot of the Madras

then taught school in Essex County, Virginia.

In 1859 he was admitted to the bar in Petersburg.

Bernard, George S. 4

picture cabinet. Topics covered in the loose
clippings include the Ashby family, William M.
Tweed, and Civil War subjects, especially the
Battle of the Crater, General William Mahone,
and the 12th Virginia Infantry. The mounted

clippings, 1897, primarily concern matters of

 

local interest in Petersburg, such as city util-
ities, taxes, and licenses, Other topics are
the Civil Service Act, the Spanish-American War,
Petersburg National Park, roads and public
schools in Virginia, and Confederate veterans.

 
Bernard, George S. 5

A copy of Our Diocesan Work for November,
1886 is included with the collection. This

Chancellorsville are given. Bernard dréw maps

Mention is also made of other more minor engage-
ments at Sewell's Point, French's Farm, and

Bernard, George S. 7
The scrapbook of clippings, 1603-1911, con-
tains material which evidently was intended for
inclusion in the proposed Volume II of War Talks.

diary with a speech by Bernard on the Gettysburg
Campaign. This talk includes diary entries and
comments on Bernard's regiment as it marched

 

through Virginia and Maryland to Pennsylvania.
There are clippings of several accounts of the
Battle of the Crater and the part Mahone's
Brigade played in it written by Bernard and

 
Bernard, George S, 8
others. Personal reminiscences of the battle

by soldiers are included. Bernard was a fierce
defender of General Mahone as the hero of this
battle, There are many clippings of speeches

Camp of Confederate Veterans. He spoke on Civil
War topics and gave one talk on slavery as the
cause of secession. Included also are Bernard's
account of the Battle of Malvern Hill, clippings
on General Mahone's death, and a list of men in
companies that were raised in Petersburg.

Berrey, Thomas J. Papers, 1885-1916. Luray,
Page Co., Virginia

 

Thomas J. Berrey was an insurance agent, co-
editor of The Page Courier, and prominent Bap-
tist layman. As a leading citizen of Luray,
Page Co., Va+, he was involved in several
activities important to the life of his commun-

 

ity. Harry M. Strickler's A Short History of

Page County, Virginia provides much information

on Luray and Berrey's activities there.
Correspondence relevant to his career as an

insurance agent consists principally of letters

 

 

 
Berrey, Thomas J. 2
from the companies which Berrey represented.
Referring to their standard procedures on such
risks as hotels, livestock, barns, and various
types of dwellings, those companies instructed
Berrey concerning what type of insurance, if
any, they would allow to be issued.

Numerous letters frem Henry Marvin Wharton
to Berrey discuss the establishment and
affairs of Luray College and the Whosoever Farm,
1895-1898 and 1900. The prominent Baptist
clergyman William Coleman Bitting was a close

friend of Berrey. His letters contain refer-

 

 
Berrey, Thomas J. 3
ences to his church in New York City and to
several political issues.

Papers relevant to The Page Courier and
other newspapers include references to adver-
tising policy, the practices of larger papers
such as The New York Herald, and the controversy
between Berrey's partner Andrew Broaddus and

 

 

 

S.J. Richey over the bankrupt Valley Land and
Imprevement Company headed by D.F. Kagey.

John Berridge (1716-1793) was an Anglican
divine located in the parish of Everton. He
was acquainted with Wesley and Whitefield and
was a Calvinist in theology. A popular speak-
er, he made many preaching tours in England,

spreading his unorthodox theology among the

crowds who gathered to hear him outside the

unfriendly churches of the establishment.
In a letter to his cousin, a Mrs. Leach,

 
Berridge, John 2

he spoke of his poor health and declined an
invitation to visit with his relatives. This
letter was written on December 7, 1773, over
nineteen years before his death, *put it indi-
cates that Berridge was not a well man. He
also wrote of his religious views.

This collection consists mainly of personal
letters by Charles Berry, a Confederate soldier,
and his father, the Rev. R. T. Berry. There is
a letter of Jan. 29, 1862, by Andrew Hunter.

The collection is worth little, but some Civil
War topics are mentioned. A letter of Aug. 29,
1863, mentions U. S. Gens. Ambrose Everett.
Burnside and William Starke Rosecrans.
3 items added, 12-26-67: Two letters from

wrote to her daughter, Mrs. Anne F. Berry,
probably the wife of R.T. Berry and mother of
Charles, In addition to news of the people of
Charlestown, Va., John J. Brown's candidacy for
Congress is also discussed in this letter,

The second letter, dated Aug. 1, 1848, was
addressed to Anne Eliza Scrogin whose mother,
Mrs. Griggs's sister, had recently died.

Little is known of the ancestry, childhood,
and early training of John Berry (1798-1870).
"According to tradition, he was orphaned at
an early age and was apprenticed to a brick
mason, but there is no record of his appren-

ticeship and the absence of brick buildings

*See card 11-12

 
Berry, John &

in or near Hillsboro does not indicate the
presence of a mason capable of assuming re-
sponsibility for the training of the young
Berry. The monumental chimneys, characteristic
of early Orange County houses, must have
furnished his earliest training.

 

Berry's work covers a long span of years,
when stylistic changes were enthusiastically
followed in the cities,... His work is not
entirely free from these influences, but
whether the style be Moorish or Gothic, his

work is characterized z extreme simplicity

 
Berry, Jonn a
and fine craftsmanship. He followed the
architectural or '‘earpenters' books’ of the
time but he never permitted himself the
romantic extravagancies of the nineteenth
century.

 

Buildings which are definitely known to be

the work of John Berry, besides the Orange
County Courthouse and Smith Hall at Chapel
Hill, include the Baptist and Methodist
Churches of Hillsboro, the first college build-
ing at Wake Forest amd two houses on the

campus of that mr St. Luke's Church

Henry Besancon served as a fifer assigned to
the 104th Regiment of New York Volunteers. His
diary presents a picture of the daily routine of
a soldier on the periphery of the military
action of the Civil War, Besancon moved with

his regiment during its three years in Virginia,
but he was often away from camp visiting friends
and drawing sketches of the countryside. He
frequently failed to keep up with his fellow

 
Besancon, Henry 2
troops during their marches from camp to camp
and would arrive late at his new quarters.

He was further separated from the military
regimen by the assignment of the musicians to
serve as nurses in the division or general
hospitals. Discipline was apparently relaxed
for the drummers and fifers, for Besancon never
mentioned being reprimanded for his tardiness.
He did refer, however, to a general order stipu-
lating that all musicians were to remain with
and follow their regiment's moves (May 19,

 

 
Besancon, Henry

 

1864).

After being discharged on Nov. 5, 1864, he
returned home, and his diary closes at the end
of that year with a description of his social
activities during the Christmas season. Al-
though he made repeated reference to various
members of his family, Besancon wrote little

in the way of biographical information about his
activities before he entered military service,
and none could be located elsewhere in the
Perkins Library. On Sept. 28, 1863, he under-

 
Besancon, Henry 4
took to learn shorthand and thereafter wrote a
few entries in his diary in that script. After
returning home, he resumed his music and art
lessons. Whether he pursued a clerical or ar-
tistic career, however, could not be determined.
His diary is useful for its references to
the movements of his regiment, brigade, divisio

 

and corps. His lists of expenditures at the
end of each volume indicate prices charged
during the war years.

Handwritten transcripts accompany these vol-

umes.

Papers, 1853(7)-1894., London, England, Sketch.
his collection relates to Richard Bethell,
First Baron Westbury (1800-1873), Lord Chancel-
lor of Great Britain.. Most of the items are
letters either to Westbury or to his second
wife, Eleanor Margaret (Tennant) Bethell,
Baroness Westbury.

A few items involve the Bethekl family.
There are two letters from Westbury to his
children when he resigned as chancellor under
pressure from the House of Commons (July 4, 1865

 
Bethell, Richard, First Baron Westbury. 2
1865). There are five letters to Lady Westbury
from Lady Elizabeth (Rigby) Eastlake, English
authoress. In the summer of 1873 she writes long
expressions of sympathy to Lady Westbury after
the baron's death (Aug. 10, 14, and 20). A
letter of a pene later is similar (July 25,1874),

 

Her letter (4 pp.) from Italy on Nov. 4, 1876,
has the usual. sympathy and religious remarks,
but also reflections on Lady Eastlake's health
and feelings. Two notes from John Griffiths,

Keeper of the Archives at Oxford, concern the
placement of a bust of Westbury and an appro-

 
 

Bethell, Richard, First Baron Westbur
priate tablet at Oxford (Dec. 20, 1873, and Aug.
1, 1877).

A number of items pertain to legal and
political matters. Ulick John de Burgh, First
Marquis of Clanricarde, tells of his opposition
to certain aspects of the measure to disestab-
lish the Anglican Church in Ireland (July 8,

1869). Henry George Grey, Third Earl Grey, also
writes about the debates and strategy in the
House of Lords concerning the measure for dis-
establishement (July 7, 10, 1869). On March 9,

 
Bethell, Richard, First Baron Westbury. 4
1869, Baron St. Leonards, an eminent lawyer,
disucsses provisions of Westbury's measure on
the copyrighting of artistic works. On July 14,
1870, George Byng, later Third Earl of Straffard,
asks Westbury if he will guide the Juries Bill
through the House of Lords. Byng was responsible
for this meausre in the House of Commons. On

 

Sept. 21, 1870, and Sept. 29, 1871, Granville
George Leveson-Gower, Second Earl Granville,
Foreign Secretary, makes a few comments on
foreign affairs and expresses his satisfaction
with the parliamentary session of 1871. The

 
Bethell, Richard, First Baron Westbury 5
improvement of the procedure for appeals in
Bengal, India, is the subject of George Campbell,
Eighth Duke of Argyll, on June 24, 1871. On

Feb, 17, 1873, Sir Roundell Palmer, First Earl
of Selborne, Lord Chancellor, expects Westbury's
assistance in the House of Lords to benefit the
Judicature Bill. Sir Alexander James Edmund

 

Cockburn, Lord Chief Justice of England from

Thomas Bibb was the second governor

1784, and grew to adulthood in Ga. The
education which he received was good for
that day, and he became a very wealthy

This collection consists of the financial
reports from the trustees of the Bibb County
Academy to the Bibb County Grand Jury. The
academy was a public school whose policies and
financial affairs were submitted for legal and

legislative approval.

In 1857, the trustees stated that the
continued operation of the female academy was
economically unwise. They sought final
approval of their plan to sell the land sur-

 
Bibb County (Ga.) Academy 2
rounding the female academy and to concentrate
all efforts to support a college. Apparently,
this proposal was defeated, for the reports for
1859 still included the female department in
the accounts.

Nathan Campbell Munroe, one of the trustees

 

whose signature appears on some of these docu-
ments, was the father-in-law of John McIntosh
Kell. See the Kell Papers for vouchers of the
Academy, 1846 and 1851-1858 (In the box of Bills
and Receipts from Educational Institutions).

Bible Moralisée was edited about 1250 in the
French royal workshops. It consists wholly of
historiated medallions, like a series of pic-
tures in stained glass transposed to parchment.
After a full page picture of the Creator, each
colored page alternates with a blank page.

The colored pages each contain eight miniatures

to Job. The second and fourth medallions con-
tain historical or emblematic moralizations

book regarded as the inner meanings or morals

of each passage in the Bible. The books from
which passages are included are Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges,

Detailed descriptions of this manuscript
appear in two sources. In the Journal of the
American Oriental Society, X (1880), exlvi-
cexlix, Isaac H. Hall discusses the manuscript
as follows (in part):

The codex at present commences at Matt. xii.
20, and continues through the gospels, in the
usual order, all of the Philoxenian or Har-
clean version. Then follows the Peshito
portion: Acts, James, I Peter, I John, the
Epistles of Paul in the usual order, ending
with a fragment of I Timothy; but of the
remainder two loose leaves had been thrust

Syriac MS. 6
into the body of the MS., thus preserving 2
portion of II Timothy and Titus, so that the
end of the whole is at Titus 1. 9. The
writing is neat and beautiful, of the transi-
tion style from Estrangelo to Jacobite.

A later scholar, F. C. Burkitt, offers cor-
rections and additional information in The
Journal of Theological Studies, XXXIII (1931-
1932), 255-202. In his discussion are the
following remarks about this manuscript:

It is said to be of the ninth century, but
I am inclined to date it a little before

1200, as the hand seems to me to be the reviv-

ed Estrangelo. .. . The Gospel-text consists
of the Harclean text, but without the charac-
teristic critical notes or marks, together
with Lectionary rubrics by the original hand
and incorporated in the text.

BIDDLE, Samuel Simpson Letters and Papers.
Newbern, N. C. 1764-19985 3586 pieces
John Simpson(1728-1788), was born in Boston,
Mass. He came to Beaufort, N.C. somewhat later
than the middle of the eighteenth centmry. He
was commissioned lieutenant in Capt. John Hard-
ee's company in July, 1757. Shortly afterwards
in 1760 he was elected one of Beaufort's repre-
sentatives in the Lower House of the Colonial
Assembly, and introduced a bill establishing the
county of Pitt. The people wished a new county

 

 
Biddle, Samuel Simpson (2)
because of the great inconvenience of the exten
of Beaufort.

When the trouble with the Regulators occurred
Simpson supdported the government and held his
regiment in readiness to oppose the insurgents
when Newbern was threatened by the imprisonment
of Herman Husband. As the trouble with Great

 

Britain increased, the committee of safety elect
ed Simpson and Edward Salter to revresent their
county in the convention at New Bern. Simpson

was a member of the Committee to asseat the

 
Biddle, Samuel Simpson (3)

vestry of St. Michaels parish, Pitt county,raise
‘supplies for the relief of Boston. When the
Provincial Congress of N.C. met at Hillsboro on
Aug.20, 1775, Simpson was present; and in Sept.
1775 he was made colonel of the Pitt regiment.
He served in the committee of safety for the
district of New Bern; he was commissioned Justic

 

of the Court of Pleas and Quarter sessions; in
1778 he became a member of the governor's
council; in 1780 he was commissioned brigadier

 
Biddle, Samuel Simpson (4)
general;and in 1782 he was a member of the N.C.
House of Commons.

John Simpson married Elizabeth, daughter of
John Hardee. Among the several children born to
this union was Samuel Simpson. Less is known of
the son, butyX he was engaged in the mercatile
business at Fort Barnwell and Newbern, dealing
Principally in cotton and naval stores. Conseq-
uently he was deeply interested in the War of
1812. and followéd events immediat@ly preceding

a

 

 
Biddle, Samuel Simpson (5)
and durigg the war with keen interest. He evid-
ently accumulated considerable wealth, and play-
ed an important part in local politics. His
friendship with William Gaston seems to have bee
n both personal and political.

Samuel Simpson was married four times and
left a daughter Mary, who married William P.

 

Biddle, a Baptist minister of Newbern, who was
associated with his father-in-law in farming and
in busxiness. Their son, Samuel Simpsm Biddle

 
 

Biddle, Samuel Simpson 6
(1811-1872) was educated at the University
of North Carolina; receiving his A.B. in

1832, He became a planter and merchant in
Craven County and married first Mary B.
Williams in 1837 and secondly Mary E. V.
Powell in 1846, He was a member of the N.C,
General Assembly in 1838. His political

affiliations were with the Whig Party, and in
1846 he was president of the Whig convention.
He was actively engaged in raising troops for
the Mexican War. It is uncertain that he

was active service in Mexico, but thereafter

 
Biddle, Samuel Simpson

he was addressed as Colonel.

 

(continued on next card)

 
Biddle, Samuel Simpson (7)

Samuel Simpson Biddle's sons, S.S.,Jr. and
James W., were educated at Wake Forest College.
They,withmg a number of other students were sus-
pended for insubordination. His daughter, Mary,
attended Chowan Instituée.

With the outbreak of the war in 1861, S.S.
Biddle, Jr. and James W. Biddle enlisted in the

 

Confederate army. While their letters do not
reveal a great deal on Military operations, they
contain interesting comments on the conditions i

 
 

Biddle, Samuel Simpson (8)
in N. C. and Virginia during the war, and on the
comparative merits of Vance and Holden as gov-
ernor. While hoping for the best, the people
came to realize that it was a matter of time
until the confederates would number theirs among
the "lost causes",

The collections is rather remarkable in that

it contains the correspondence of four generat-
ions of Simpsons and Biddles, and consequeatly

#t throws puch light on the history of these
amilies who played a rather important part in

local affairs for over a hundred years, It con-
tains interesting and valuable information on
Colonial affairs, on social and economic

 
Samuel Simpson, Sketch,

Matters, on college life, and on the Civil War.
The 2,157 pieces added (May, 1941), refer
largely to the Civil War, There is considerable
description of campaigns, troop movements, camp
life, and epidemics among the letters of members
of the family who participated in the war. There

1s also some reference to the naval conflict

along the coast. Among other subjects touched
upon are federal prisoners, the execution of de
serters, and of Southern traitors, fortificatio
at James Island, comments on various generals,
including Beauregard and Hampton. There are fur-
ther letters from - » the family who were

 
Biddle, Samuel Simpson, Sketch, (10)
students at various schools, including Liuisburg
Academy, Chowan, Warrenton, and from boys at
Wake Forest College. Some of the legal papers
refer to the confiscation of southern property
by Federal forces. y» * Ps

Three hundred seventy-five items added to
this collection Feb., 1945, consist of notes,
deeds, wills, itemized accounts, and a few
Civil War letters. There are numerous letters
from two of Samuel Biddle's daughters, Mary
and Rosa, and from a son, B.F. Biddle, en-
rolled at Wake Forest College.

Biggs, Asa. Papers. Williamston, Martin Co.,
N. C. and Norfolk, Va.

 

Asa Biggs (1811-1878) was born in William-
ston, N. C., and practiced law there after he
was admitted to the bar in 1831. He served
several terms in the state legislature and was
elected to one term in the U. S. House of Repre-

sentatives. In 1854, he was elected to the U. §
Senate, but he resigned that office in 1858 to
accept an appointment as a U. S. district judge
in North Carolina. With the outbreak of the
Civil War, he left his U. S. post and served as

 
Biggs, Asa 2
a Confederate States judge from 1661 to 1865.
During the war, he moved from Williamston to
Nash County to be further from the scene of bat-
tle and settled in Tarboro in Edgecomb County
at the close of the war. In 1869, he closed
his law office in Tarboro and moved to Norfolk,
Virginia, where he became associated with his
brother Kader as a commission merchant and cot-
ton factor. He remained in this business until
his death.

The pre-Civil War letters are miscellaneous
in character and concern in part a mercantile

 

 
Biggs, Asa 2
firm in which the Biggs family had an interest.
Two letters in 1827 are from Cushing Biggs Has-
sell who later became a prominent merchant and
church leader in Williamston. Correspondence
during the war involves the entire Biggs family.
Two sons, Henry A. and William, served in Nort
Carolina regiments. William entered the Army
in 1861 and attained the rank of captain in the
17th Regiment, while Henry A. Biggs joined Man-
ly's Battery in July 1864. Their letters are
concentrated in 1864 and 1865 and provide an

 

 
Biggs, Asa 4
excellent account of the war. Stationed near
Petersburg and Wilmington, they participated in
two major battles, and their letters home con-
tain numerous comments on their activities.

The letters from Asa Biggs to his wife and
family are generally personal in content, though
he at times referred to conditions in William-
ston and other locales. There is no material

 

concerning his political career. When this col-
lection was recataloged, four letters to Cushing
Biggs Hassell were transferred to the Hassell
Papers. Two of these letters were written by

 
Biggs, Asa 5
Biggs to Hassell, and they do contain references
made by him to political matters.

The volume was begun as a diary by one of
Biggs's daughters, possibly Della, in 1855
during a visit to Washington. After only a few
diary entries, the volume becomes simply a re-
cord of household duties and financial accounts.

Bilimyer, David, et al. Sket@h -l-

This collection consists of letters and papers
of the Billmyer family of Shepherdstown, Jeff-
erson County, West Va. David Billmyer served
as a representative in the West Va. House of
Delegates in 1867 and 1868. He owned a re-
tail drygoods store in Shepherdstown for

 

many years, which he eventually turned over
to his son Willian.
David Billmyer owned a mule-powered grain

boat which plied the canal along the Potomac

 
Billmyer, David -2-

 

river from Shepherdstown to Georgetown, D.C.
The boat carried wheat and corn thet Bill-
myer bought on speculation and sold in the
Georgetown markets.

David Billmyer married Sarah Ellen Spong
of Shepherdstown. Their children were William

H., Sallie, Edward, Jefferson Davis, George,
John, and Ellen Brooks Billmyer. Mrs. Bill-
myer's mother was a Shepherd and there are

several letters from her Shepherd relatives.

a

 

Henry E. Unseld, a former resident of
Shepherdstown and suitor to Mrs. Billmyer,
writes many lettérs to her describing New
Orleans during 1854 and 1855. The New Orleans
theatre, society in that city, the Irish Up-
rising, the Know-Nothing political party, and

the yellow fever epidemics there are dis-
cussed by Unseld. In 1856 Unhseld joined the
Company "A" Rangers of the Nicaraguan Army.

 
Billmyer, David -4-

 

He was with the Conservatives fighting at
Granada against William Walker's Liberals of
Lyon, who had seized control of the govern-
ment. There are three letters from Nicaragua.
In 1858 Unseld describes Warrensburg, Mo.,

in his correspondence to Ellen Billmyer, and
in 1859 he moved to Illinois and describes
that region. He speaks of the Billmyers'
having been terrorized by "Black Brown's"

 
Billmyer, David ~5~-

 

marauders, supposedly colored tersorhete
raiders razing the countryside folowing
John Brown's trial.

There is an unsigned letter of August 10,
1861, to Mrs. Ellen Billmyer stating that the

Prince Napoleon reviewed the 2nd regiment, Va.
Volunteers, prohably written by John G. Un-
seld, who was a private in that regiment.

On July 27, 1861, a nephew of Mrs. Biblmyer

 
Billmyer, David -6—

wrote describing the annihilation of the Ells-
worth Zouave Regiment. The collection con- [e
tains Sarah Ellen Billmyer's oath of allegiance
to the United States, dated Feb. 10, 1865)

There are several letters from David Bill-
myer written while he was in the House of

 

Delegates at Wheeling, West Va., but aside
from the problem of locating a permanent
capital for West Va., his letters are largely

 
Billmyer, David -7-

 

concerned with his store and family. He ran
for Senate in 1869, but lost the election.
William H. Billmyer attended West Va.
Agricultural College (later the University
of West Va.) at Morgantown in 1868. In 1869
he went to Georgetown College, Georgetown,

D.C. Sallie Billmyer was a student at Hagers-
town Female Seminary, Hagerstown, Md., in
1868-69. There are several letters concerning
the current conditions in the Golleges at

 
Billmyer, David -8-

 

that time.

The majority of the letters in this coll-
ection are of a personal or trivial nature
concerning incidents in the lives of the
immediate relatives & friends. Much interest
is shown in religion and temperance. Shep-

herdstown had a lively Sons of Temperance
League during this period.

Jefferson Davis Billmyer, David's third
son, gained local prominemce in 1901-1904 as
reform sheriff of Jefferson County, W. VA.

BIRCKHEAD, Edward F Letters & Papers 1842-95
Earlyville, Va. Sketch B27 _pieces
Edward F. Birckhead was a physician and farme
of Earlyville, Virginia, Although the early de-
cades of the collection contain several communi-
cations concerning prices and shipment of corn,
meal, plaster, wheat, flour, and tobacco from corm
mission firms, and the later years include a few

 

bills from Birckhead for professional services,
still the collection can not be said to contain
extensive information on either profession,

For the Civil War years there are several
accounts which indicete that Birckhead was "one

 
BIRCKHEAD -2-

of the military committee for District No. 2..."
The apparent function of this committee was to
dispense aid to indigent familiew of soldiers.
Also for these years and continuing into the post
war years there are a number of letters to Birck
head's daughter, Millie, from friends and former
schoolmates at Piedmont Female Academy. These
contain occasional references to the war but on
the whole ere more indicative of the social life
and customs of the period. Among the undated

material is a number of compositions written b
Millie while she was a student at the Academy.”

 

 
BIRCKHEAD -3-

The latter years of the collection ave largely
taken up with accounts of the estates of Nehemiah
Birckhead and of Wm. P, Wilkerson. Edward Birck-=
head was executor for each of these,

One isolated letter, dated Oct. 20, 1850, ts o
particular interest. It seems to have been mkkxx
written to Birkkhead by a young friend who was

 

studying medicine in Philadelphia and mentions mnt
Only his studies but also abolitionist sentiment,
Negro uprisings, and a concer#? given py Jenny
Lind.

15 items added 11-6-57. These are mainly
personal letters from James S. Hamm, Gainesville
Ala., lawyer. His letter of June 18, 1847, to-
gether with an accompanying newspaper clipping,
throws some light on Ala. social life and

customs. The correspondence carries comments
on the cause of the murder of Dr. Sidney S.
Perry by Col. John A. Winston, a prominent
lawyer and state senator who was mentioned for

the governorship.

William T. Bishop, justice of the peace, debt
collector, and attorney, was the son of Charles
Bishop of Manchester, Pennsylvania. Sater T. and
Catharine Ann Walker were the parents of William
Bishop's wife, Caroline Catharine. Mr. Walker
was a merchant in Baltimore, Maryland.

In general the correspondence is addressed
to one or both of the Bishops and pertains to
family and business matters. Throughout the

 
Bishop, William T., Papers 2

 

papers are letters from Walker to his daughter
Caroline.

The one letter in 1818 is from Joseph E.
Bishop to his cousin Charles Bishop Marchant.
During the 1830's William and Caroline Bishop
lived first in Louisville, Kentucky and then in

Manchester, Pennsylvania. Letters for this
period concern the sale of a slave, sickness,
cholera, and private financial and business
problems.

The bulk of this collection occurs during the

 
Bishop, William T., Papers 3
1840's, when the Bishop family moved to Hummels-
town, Pennsylvania. In the first half of the
decade, references are made to the fact that
Walker is not as wealthy as he used to be and
that he is commencing a dry goods business.

In 1842 Bishop was involved in a court case

 

with the Savings Bank of Baltimore. Of par-
ticular interest is a letter dated July 8, 1844,
from J. W. Oliver in New York, telling Bishop
about the Sons of Temperance. Two other letters
in that year are about this organization, one of

 
Bishop, William T., Papers 4

 

which notes that Bishop is a temperance Lecturer.
During the years 1845 to 1849 some of the

letters concern Bishop's employment as a justice

of the peace and a debt collector. Walker became

estranged from his wife, who Fell ill and died

in 1846. He married "Mary Ann" the next year.

In 1847 there are letters penned by John C.
Bucher and Henry A. Muhlenberg, both Pennsyl-
vania congressmen and lawyers. The conflict
between Sater Walker and his children is partic-
ularly evident during this period; some lawsuits

 
Bishop, William T., Papers

were instituted concerning the Walker family
property. The profit made on some merchandise
taken to California and sold is mentioned in a
letter of 1849.

There is one letter for 1850, noting that
Bishop was a lawyer in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
and one in 1863 to Mrs. Bishop from her
daughter, Carrie.

Natchez says that in 1860 two clans from Natchez
and its vicinity, the Bislands and Minors, had

an investment in real and personal property in
three parishes of the sugar country of Louisiana
worth nearly two million dollars. By 1790

John Bisland had built a mansion in Natchez

letters from him to his parents show that he
was attending the Sheridan Classical School

He was married around 1890, his wife's
name being Docia T. Beving. He had a son,
John Lucas Bevins, who was sent to Clemson

Bevins had a political career of some im-
portance, which started with his appointment
as trial justice for Colleton County, 1885,
He served as County Commissioner, was in the
State House iof Legislature ¢. 1900, and was

for a time the State Senator from Dorchester
County ec. 1904. In 1908 he served as a
Presidential Elector. Some years later he

RR Cole Blease, who served as governor

The set 1s Comprised mostly of family
letters and various legal papers. Its im-
portance may be seen in its revelation of
political problems and methods in South Caro-
lina from 1885-1915. Special note should be

 

taken of the correspondence between Cole Blease
and Bevins, the latter evidently being a
henchman of the former. The letters of Blease

Madras, India.

 

Valentine Blacker (1778-1823) was a promi-
nent officer of the Madras Army in the service
of the East India Company and the author of a
history of the Mahratta War of 1817-1819. He
arrived at Madras in 1798 and thereafter served

in numerous campaigns in southern India. In
1810 he became Quartermaster General of the
Madras Army and later Surveyor General of India
The library has a copy of his history, Memoir

 
Blacker, Valentine 2
of the Operations of the British Army in india
During the Mahratta | War of Lol/, » and
I8ig faaten

This letter book. consists of copies of letiers
from Valentine Blacker to his father from 1798
to 1813. There are also a few letters from his
uncle, Sir Barry Close, and others that relate
to him. The public news from India, primarily
military but occasionally political, varies in
detail according to the extent of Blacker's in-
volvement in the events. Battles and campaigns

 

 

 

 
Blacker, Valentine 3
in which he did not participate are usually men-
tioned only summarily. Valentine traveled
through most of the territories of the southern
half of the Indian peninsula, and his remarks
sometimes provide interesting information on the
countryside and the life and customs of its
population, .

 

Blacker's Irish family connections were im-
portant to his career in India. His father was
the Reverend St. John Blacker, Rector of Moira,
County Down, and Prebendary of Inver, County

 
Blacker, Valentine 4
Donegal, and his mother was Grace Close, daugh-
ter of Maxwell Close of Elm Park, County Armagh.
One of Grace Close's brothers was Sir Barry
Close (1756-1813), who was Adjutant General of
the Madras Army when Valentine began his duties
with it. Barry Close had a distinguished ca-
reer and retired as a major general. He is a
constant topic in the letters of this volume.

Blacker, Valentine =
London, » pp. 117, 190-191. In addition,

members of the family in Ireland and England
are frequently mentioned in the correspondence.

A calendar with descriptive entries for each
letter is filed with the letter book. This
calendar is not an index, but it may assist
with the location of topics, especially those
noted in this.sketch,

The volume begins with a letter of October
14, 1799, from Barry Close in which he dis-
cusses Valentine's arrival, British prepared-

 

 
Blacker, Valentine 6
ness in case of war With the French and Mysore,
and the Close family in Ireland. Blacker's
correspondence commences in 1798. From July

to September he describes the voyage to India.
On the same ship is a descendant of Sir
William Temple who becomes a friend of Blacker.
Valentine relates the circumstances of Temple's

 

decision to go to India and reports often on

his career there until his death in 1800, In
late September the ship anchors at Madras, and
Valentine writes about his reception by Close,

 
Blacker, Valentine .
his duties and studies, Close's residence, and
the expectation of a military campaign after
the rainy season. In October Blacker begins
military campaigning with marches to Arcot and
Vellore. As becomescustomary in the correspon-
dence, he comments on his travels, as exhibited

 

in the description of a religious ceremony
(p. 17). In late November he discusses the
for§ at Vellore, preparations for war with
Mysore, Mahratta horsemanship, the death of
Colonel Aston in a duel, and his and Temple's

duties.

 
Blacker, Valentine 8
From January until the summer of 1799

Blacker reports on the Fourth Mysore War which
ended in the overthrow of Moslem power in Mysore
and the death of its ruler, Tipu Sultan, one of
Britain's most formidable opponents in southern
India. Blacker, a cavalry officer, participated
in the marches, skirmishes, and battles that

 

culminated in the siege and capture of
Seringapatan. Illness caused Valentine to with-
draw from the campaign at the end of March, and
his commentary on the fall of Seringapatam and

 
Blacker, Valentine

the conclusion of the war is not firsthand.
Until March 31, however, he records events in
which he took part. He serves with Barry Close
whose activities are noted. There are extracts
of letters in which General Harris and Governor
General Wellesley praise Close's work during
the campaign (p, 23). A copy of Harris's lette
of May 13 to the Governor General and the reply
of the latter's secretary are recorded in a page
from the Madras Gazette (between pp. 36 and 37).
These letters cite various officers who are re-

 

 

 
10

Blacker, Valentine
cognized for meritorious service. The summer
months are occupied with the reduction of hill
forts and the suppression of remnants of Tipu's
army.

In July Valentine goes to Arcot and then is
assigned to raise a cavalry force for the Nizam

 

ef Hyderabad. By September, however, the Nizam
gets a withdrawal of this plan. Barry Close is
now Regent of Mysore, but military duties con-
tinue to demand his attention. Close makes a
three-months tour of Mysore in which Blacker’

 
11

Blacker, Valentine
participates. Valentine reports on the tour
and on Close's assumption of his duties and
residence at Seringapatam. In December he
notes that his brother, St John, may come to
India.

A useful account of the Fourth Mysore War

 

is given in John William Fortescue, A Histor
of the British Army (London, 1915), Vol. IV,
Part 2. Other volumes of this work have maps
and histories of other military actions that
are mentioned in this letter book.

 

 
Blacker, Valentine Bs
In early 1800 Blacker reports on marches a-
gainst districts of the Polygar rajahs and
territory now occupied by the former cavalry
commander of Tipu Sultan. Troops also open the
road from Seringapatam to the Carnatic. Valen-
tine notes such aspects of the country as hunt-
ing with trained tigers and Tipu's palaces and

 

game preserve. He is appointed to the command
of Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Welling-
ton, but soon returns to duty with the escort of
Barry Close, Regent of Mysore. Hereafter

 
13
Blacker, Valentine

 

Valentine comments on Wellesley and his military
activities, though not in detail. In May, 1800,
he notes the outfitting of an expedition for the
north. Also recorded is the fact that Valen-
tine's father is compiling a volume from his
correspondence, presumably this letter’ book.

St. John Blacker may come to India, and his
brother discusses the advantages of military
service here. In August, however, he notes the
difficulties of acquiring honestly a fortune in
the Indian service and also mentions his prize

 
Blacker, Valentine 14
money from the campaign against Seringapatanm.
Illness prevents Valentine from joining
Wellesley's expedition against. the robber army

of Doondia Wao, but it is occasionally men-
tioned. Wellesley and forces of the Nizam and
of the Mahrattas combine to suppress the enemy

 

in the region northwest of Mysore. The corre-
spondence of 1800 has a variety of subjects
among which are: Clese's nephews, Robert Close
and St. John Blacker whe cOme to India; the
inadequacy of the Anglican establishment in

 
15

Blacker, Valentine
southern India; mortality in the army and the

soldier's attitude to his dangerous life; liter-
ature and science in Sanskrit; the Brahmins; the
Hindu religion; a Jain idol at Chinroypatane and
the remnants of its worshipers; his surveying
duties; the sacred mountain of Shevagunga (or

 

Sivaganga); Mount Bababooden and the mythical
account of its transfer from a Hindu to a Moslem
holy place; and his participation in an expedi-
tion against the Nairs.

 
16

Blacker, Valentine

In January, 1601, Blacker is with the rorce
that occupies the territory of Wynaad. He then
joins in the Polygar War of 1801-1802 in the
southeastern corner of the peninsula. Since
Valentine is in the field, he provides some de-
tail on the operations through June,1801. The

 

names of such places and battles as Panjalam-
coorchy, Ramnad, Madura, Cheswail, and Caliar~
coil appear in his accounts. He also comments
as usual on the countryside and its inhabitants

 
Blacker, Valentine 17
and animal lire. Meritorious service in combat
does not draw the recognition that it gets in
European warfare, complains Blacker occasion-
ally. Later when war covers Europe, he will not
describe military service in India so advanta-
geously as during his early correspondence.
Nevertheless, he remains contented with his ser-

 

vice in India except for the inability to ac-
quire a fortune, a task that is helped by dis-
honesty, he asserts. Battle accounts end in
June except for a few reports such as one on

October 5 and

 
Blacker, Valentine 138
the letter of Barry Close on pages 79-dl.

During September and October, 1801, Blacker
reports on: potential strife with the Mahrattas;
trouble in the south; the Court of Directors and
its myopic stress on limiting the military es-
tablishment; Lord Mornington, the Governor Gen-
eral; the justice of British control of Arcot;
the advantages of British rule in comparison to
native mismang@gement; and the appointment of
Barry Close to the Mahratta Court

at Poona. st. John Blacker and Robert Ulose ar-
rive and begin their military careers. Their
activities become a constant topic of the corre-
spondence. In December Valentine recounts his
part in military action against the Polygars.

In December Blacker devotes several pages to
a discussion of the present state of the reli-

 

gion and political power of the Moslems in
southern India. The Nizam of Hyderabad, the
last important Moslem ruler, is sustained a-
gainst the Mahrattas only by the British. Valen-

 
. 20.
Blacker, Valentine
tine also comments on the life and customs of
the Moslem population.

A variety of topics appear in the letters
from 1802. Among them are: an expedition a-
gainst marauders in the Nellore District; a
meeting with the ruler of Soondoor; hunting and

 

hawking in the local manner; Valentine's pro-
motion to a post at Trichinopoly; criticism of
English marriage customs; English-Mahratta

hostility; the Hindu myth of Adam's Bridge be-

 
2l

tween Ceylon and India; the difficulty of ac-
quiring a fortune in the Indian service; the
caste system as a source of Indian political
weakness; British policy toward retiring the
rajahs from administrative power; and the duties
of the Guides in the Quartermaster General's

 

Department. On page 99 there is a list of the

officers of the First Regiment of Native Cav-

alry in 1803 of which Valentine is a member.
During the first half of 1803 Blacker is with

 
22
Blacker, Valentine
troops in Hyderabad who await action against the
Mahrattas, but he does not become engaged in
major action. Although there is news about the
war, it lacks the detail that is given campaigns
in which Valentine takes part. During the year
he comments upon such matters as: the deposi-

 

tion of the heir to the Nabob of the Carnatic;
expectation of the arrival of French troops and
the consequent alteration of military strategy;
Arthur Wellesley; the Battle of Assaye on Sep-

 
23

Blacker, Valentine
tember 23; and Governor Bentinck.

In the first part of 1804 Blacker is at
Madras and reports on his life and duties there.
During the summer and fall of 1804 and in early
1805 he helps quell rebellion near Chittoer. The
Mahratta War is occasionally and summarily noted

 

In 1805 Valentine settles more or less per-
manently at Madras, and military campaigns re-
cede from any detailed consideration. Although
public matters appear frequently in the corre-

 
24
Blacker, Valentine
spondence, their treatment is not usually exten-
Sive. Valentine's life and duties at Madras and
his relatives both in Britain and in India as-
sume primary attention. Grace and Charlotte
Blacker, sisters of Valentine and St. John, come
to Madras in 1808. In 1809 Grace marries Robert

 

Alexander, a civil official at Madras, and Char-
lotte marries Lieutenant Colonel, later General
John Munro* These persons, along with the

Blackers and Cleses in India, are prominent in

*See Autograph File for Munro letters.

Blacker, Valentine
the correspondence, especially Munro who is .
Quartermaster General on the coast and later
Resident at Travancore. Because of Munro, news
from Travancore appears in the letters from 1809
to 1813.

Among the miscellaneous topics of the last

 

eight years are; the Mahratta War (1806, p. 139
mutiny among native troops and the massacre of

Europeans at Vellore (pp. 142-143); Valentine's
participation in a campaign in Travancore in

Barry Close for which negotiations were carried
+ with John Flaxman, a noted sculptor (pp. 168-

The letters constituting this collection are
from J. A. Dunn, overseer of Blackmon's plan-
tation near Point Jefferson. He writes in March
and August, 1862, about the operation of the
plantation which included the building of a
cotton gin, and illness among the slaves. There

 

is an undated fragment of a letter of possibly
the same year.

On Jan. 5, 1864, Dunn writes from Walnut
Hill, Ark., where he is refugeeing, along with
& large number of others. He describes the

 
Blackmon, Homer 3
difficulties he encountered in trying to leave
home after the Federals occupied that area;
desertion and thievery among the slaves; the
cooperation of a number of them with the Fed-
erals in acquainting the latter with the where-
abouts of livestock and other property, some of
which the Federals took; Dunn's detention over-

 

night as an alleged spy; the desertion of the
slaves of at least three of the neighbors; the
death of a Dr. Powell who was preparing to move
from the Point Jefferson area to Ark.; and ill-
ness in his own family.

This collection takes its name from the letés

Blackwell, William Thomas. Papers. Durham,
Durham County, North Carolina

William Thomas Blackwell (1839-1903), has bee
called the father of Durham. A native of Person
County, Blackwell early began a career selling
smoking tobacco in eastern North Carolina be-
fore and during the Civil War. This tobacco,

 

largely the product of the Durham factory of
John R. Green, was popular with both Union and
Confederate troops. In 1869, Blackwell pur-

chased the Green tobacco factory and its trade-
mark, Bull Durham. He was joined in this

 
Blackwell, William Thomas 2
business in I87I by Julian S. Carr. The Durham
Smoking Tobacco Company became world renowned.
Blackwell sold his interest in the organization
to Julian S. Carr and others in 1883, together
with the famous Bull Durham trademark. At this
time the company was chartered as Blackwell's
Durham Tobacco Company.

It is at this time that the letters, bills,
and receipts of the addition of 1-30-71 begin.

That portion of the Blackwell Papers which
was catalogued in 1937 consists of four volumes
of personal accounts, 1884-1889.

 

 
Blackwell, William Thomas 3
Blackwell organized the Bank of Durham in
1883, using his considerable private fortune as

the basis of this institution. The Bank of
Durham Papers have been transferred to this col-
lection, as they relate the history of this
venture of Blackwell which ended in bankruptcy
on Nov. 14, 1889, when V. Ballard and W.S.

 

Halliburton took over the bank as t@rstees.
Blackwell had extended too liberal credit to

his fellow citizens. When his estate was set-
tled after his death in 1903, it was found that
he had paid "most of what he owed, on account of

 
Blackwell, William Thomas 4
his failure.”

His papers relate to his personal and bank-
ing career in the late 1880's. They contain a
letter, July 5, 1886, by N.A. Ramsey from
Brevard in which he describes the mica-rich
lands of the University of North Carolina in the
western part of the state which were valuable

 

enough to warrant some sort of trade with the
trustees of the University to secure them. As
late as September 17, 1889, V. Ballard was

still trying to collect accounts due to the Bank
of Durham. The Blackwell Papers end in 1889.

 
Blackwell, William Thomas 5
After that date Blackwell wrote a number of let-
ters to the Duke family which are found in their
papers in this department.

For biographical details of W.T. Blackwell,
see the James A. Robinson sketch of his life
in the Charles Leonard Van Noppen Papers.
William K. Boyd refers to the career of W.T.
Blackwell in The Story of Durham, as does Hiram

V. Paul in History of Durham, N.C.

3 vols. added, 3-3-78.

 

One volume is the Trustees Ledger, 1888-1889,
for the Bank of Durham after its failure. V.
Ballard and W. S. Halliburton were the trustees.
The identity of this unlabeled ledger is proved
by the correlation between the account on p, 14

for the Bank of Durham and the account for the
trustees in the bank's General Ledger No. 2,
1887-1889, pp. 16-17. The Trustees Ledger was

eer ee as a Durham Anonymous Account

be the book used by a collection messenger.
Collection services and records are described
in Chapter XVII and also page 105 of Frank
Loomis Beach's Bank System and Accounting (New

 

York, 1927). A few entries have been traced
into the bank's ledger, for the Collection Book
was not labeled as to ownership. This volume

mous Collection Boo

 
Blackwell, William Thomas 8
The Remittances Book, March LO-Nov. 14, 1088,

it dates from the proper time and was cataloged
at the same time as other books gp ey to
the bank. This volume was formerly cataloged
as a Durham, N.C., Anonymous Account Book.

pamphlet which relate to Lord Dufferin's term
as governor-general of India. Twenty-seven let-

 

ters are from Dufferin to Sir Andrew Richard
Scoble, a member of the governor-general's coun-
cil. These letters to Scoble (1886-1888) are
short and usually concern appointments to office
and requests for advice, There are two letters

Dufferin praises Sir Courtenay Peregrine Ilbert,
a retiring member of his council. The pamphlet
(14pp,. dated Aug. 18, 1887) is the governor-
General's reply to charges which were made
against the appointment of Sir Charles Umpher-
ston Aitchison to his council.

 

1 item added, 7-13-61. This item is a
personal letter (Feb. 22, 1799) of Sir Henry
Blackwood, First Baronet, a British vice ad-
miral who was the great uncle of the First
Marquis of Dufferin and Ava,

Papers, 9-18-61. On Feb. 18, 1867, Lord
Dufferin relates to George Hamilton that he has
been offered the governorship of Bombay with a
hint that he might later become governor-
general of India. The offer is highly tempting,

but Dufferin declines, he says, for his mother's
ot (she dies a few months later on June 13,
1867).

1 item added, 9-1-62. On January 13, 1872,
Lord Dufferin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lan-

 
caster but not a member of the cabinet, t

a Mr. Henderson for information that he has
sent. Dufferin, however, attaches “enormous
importance to the development and extensive
application of Mr. Bright's clauses," and
"should be very glad to see one half of the
soil of the country possessed in fee simple by

its cultivators." Bright's clauses were addi-
tions by John Bright, President of the Board
of Trade, to the Irish Land Act of 1870.

These clauses allowed loans to tenants for the
purchase of land from their landlords.

Blackwood-Lloyd Family. Papers. Hillsborough,
Orange Co., N.C.

 

This collection consists almost totally of
personal correspondence. In 1891 Robert P.
Blackwood of Hillsborough was an employee of
the Richmond and Danville Railroad Company. An

Alliance Trade Card dated January 1, 1892, shows
that he was a member of the Elm Grove Alliance
No. 728. Mrs. Nannie M. Blackwood to whom a

* number of the letters are addressed may have

been the wife of Samuel D. Blackwood. An un-
dated note states that he was ordained an elder

 
Blackwood-Lloyd Family 2°
of New Hope Church on June 11, 1871, and his
oldest daughter Nannie who was ten months old
was baptized.

A frequent correspondent of Mrs. Nannie
Blackwood in 1897 and 1898 was her brother Her-
bert, an employee of the Insane Asylum in
Raleigh. Beginning in January 1907, and running
through Feb. 9, 1909, is a series of admonitory
letters addressed to W. Alexander Blackwood by
his mother in Blackwood, N.C. He was in Wil-
mington, N.C., until he moved to Durham either
in 1907 or 1908. In Durham he was employed by

 

 
Blackwood-Lloyd Family 3
Eubanks and Glosson Furniture Company. A letter
from Jesse F. Minnis, a missionary in India,
written in November, 1927, thanks Mrs. Nannie
E. Lloyd and other members of the Union Grove
Church who had sent them a box of useful items.
Several of the later letters are addressed
to Mrs. Mittie McCauley, formerly Miss Mittie
D. Blackwood of Blackwood, N.C., and jointly to
her and Nannie Lloyd (Mrs. Junius M.) in the
1940s. Since a letter of June 8, 1938, ad-
dressed to Mrs. Lloyd refers to her kinswoman
Ruth Blackwood, it may be a safe assumption

 

 
Blackwood-Lloyd Family 4
that Mrs. Nannie Blackwood was later Mrs. Nannie
Lloyd. A letter of August 27, 1955, written by
Mrs. E. R. Kirkpatrick in Guadalajara, Mexico,
to Mrs. McCauley in Hillsborough, tells of her
depressed only son, a World War II veteran,
killing his estranged wife and himself in Gal-
veston, Texas. After telling the story of his

 

adult life in a few sentences she expresses her
grief and her faith in God and then mentions
the attractions of Guadalajara.

An undated history of Elm Grove School in
Orange County that is in the Craig Family Papers

 
Blackwood-Lloyd Family 5

 

lists Mattie Blackwood as one of the pupils of
that school who became a teacher.

See also the James N. Craig Papers for Black-
wood genealogy.
