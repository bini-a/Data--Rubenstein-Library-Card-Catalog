Co., Va,

Indentures, wills, bonds, accounts of settle-
ments of estates, especially of William Smith,
and a few mercantile accounts of Henry Kagey,
“one of the early German settlers of Shenandoah
County. Some of the documents are in German
script. There are also personal letters, some

 

from settlers in Ohio, which include religious
musings, references to weather and crop condit-
ions, and family and local news.

The wills are those of: John Baughman, June 6
1802; Michael Crouse, May 13 and June 18, 1807;

 
Kagey, Henry 2.
Anna Kagey, Apr. 17, 1863; Henry Kagey,. Oct. 18,
1783; John Kagey, Mar. 1, 1832; Anna Neff, widow
of Jacob Neff, June 6, 1830; and William Smith,
Nov. 22, 1797.

The Civil War letters include those of Caspar
C. Henkel, surgeon in Aug., 1861, of the 2nd
Regt. of Va. Militia under Col. Mann Spitler
(see letter of Aug. 20, 1861 , and QO. R., Series
1, Vol. V, pp. 820-821). Henkel writes from
Camp Fair Grounds near Winchester, naming his
regiment and telling how the men are quartered,
their illnesses, drilling, skirmishes, and a

 

 
Kagey, Henry 3
raid against the Union men in Martinsburg. His
letter is addressed to David F. Kagey of the
8th Star Artillery, a company in Cant. William
H.Rice's battery of the 23rd Va. Regt. The
next month he writes to his friend Kagey, who,
he has heard, has gone home to New Market with
jaundice. Again he speaks of illness in the

 

army and deficiencies of the medical department.
A contract of Nov. 22, 1861, between David

F. Kagey and Churchville Jenkins for Jenkins

to serve as his substitute is accompanied by

a list of articles Kagey wasxka furnished

Jenkins. é

 
Kagey, Henry &

In 1863 there are love letters from David
Kagey to a "Miss Emma."

By early Sept., 1863, Henkel was at Camp
"Inspection, " near Orange C. H., Va. He has
learned that Kagey is to attend medical school
at the Univ. of Va. In writing to him he an-
alyzes various courses in medicine and speaks
of the fact that he will get clinical experience
at the hospitals at Charlottesville, the want
of which was formerly a serious weakness of the

school. He also speaks of being forced to wit-
ness the execution of ten men of the 3ra N. CG.

 

 
Kagey, Henry 5
Inf., which was in his brigade. These men were
accused of desertion and the murder of an offi-
cer who endeavored to arrest them.

By Oct. 1, 1863, Kagey was a medical student
at the University of Va., and there are synop-
ges by him of two lectures delivered by Dr.
Howard on medical jurisprudence.

On Jen. 25, 1864, Henkel writes a letter of
advice to Kagey, who is facing the draft. He
suggests he either try for the job of enrolling
officer of their district or hospital steward
of some cavalry regiment. He also mentions his
comfortable quarters, oo of what makes

 

 
Kagey, Henry 6
an army effective, good soldiers desert, and
sickness so prevalent. Kagey managed to furnish
a substitute for Capt. Gilmer's Cav. co. and
in Feb. 1864, was still attending medical lect-
ures at the Univ. of Va.

The Association for the Relief of Maimed
Soldiers was established in Jan. 1864. The

 

next month a meeting was held in the Methodist
Episcopal Church at New Market to raise money
toward the establishment of a factory within the
Confederacy for the manufacture-of artificial
limbs to be given free to soldiers. Minutes of

 
Kagey, Henry 7
the meeting show that $650 was collected.

Apout Apr. 1, 1864, Kagey secured an appoint-
ment as hospital stewerd with the 25th Va. Regt.
of Infantry. There are reports for sick and
wounded for July,1864, in the 25th, 42nd,
and 48th Inf. In August Kagey wrote to the
Surgeon “eneral of the Confederacy that since
most of his regt. had become casualties during
the summer campaign, and he was so desirous of
continuing the study of medicine, he requested
assignment to Richmond during the four-month
session of the Medical College there. The frag-

 

 
Kagey, Henry 8
ment of a diary by Kagey which runs from Aug.
13 to Oct. 30, 1864, reveals that he was ina
division operating around his home town of New
Market during that time.

After the war Kagey remained in New Market,
The post war papers are of no particular sig-
nificance in so far as public affairs went.

 

Among the undated papers are several pages of
accounts which contain many local names.

These two letters reveal only partially the
story of Joseph Keeding's difficulties. It
appears, however, that he was a native of
Frederick County, Virginia, where his conduct
had met with the disapproval of his family, his

wife, her family, and his friends generally.

The nature of the trouble is not revealed, but
it may have been gambling. In any case Keeding
had gone to Indiana where he had reformed, was

teaching school, and was in general doing very
well. He contemplated going to New Orleans where
he thought he could earn much more than in

Keitt (1824-1864), was born in Orangeburg
District, South Carolina, educated at South Car-
Olina College, and began the practice of law in
Orangeburg. He soon entered politics and served
four terms in the South Carolina legislature.

He was elected to Congress in 1852 and served
until 1861. Throughout his political career he
was an ardent state rights and pro-seceesion
leader. He was a member of the South Carolina
secession convention and of the provisional con-

gress of the oe In 1862 he raised

 
KEITT, Laurence Massillon Sketch, 2
a regiment and later was in command of the for-
ces on Sullivan's Island, where he remained un-
til May 1864, when his regiment was transferred
to Virginta&é. One June 1, 1864, he was wounded
in the Battle of Cold Harbor and died the foll-
owing day.

These letters, beginning in 1855 were written

 

chiefly by Keitt to Susanna Sparks, the girl he
eventually married. They contain some comment
on politics, on the Know-Nothing Party, and on
Washington society, but for the most part they
filled with philsophical reflections and assur-
ance of his strong “eo for "Sue."

 
KEITT, Laurence Massillon Sketch, 3

Sue, on the other hand, was very different and
beset by girlish indecision. She agreed to
Marry Keitt in January, 1856, but for some reas-
on postponed the wedding and in July, 1856, brok
off their engagement entirely. What happened
between that and 1859 is not revealed because of
a Lacuna in this body of correspondence.

In any case Keitt and Susanna Sparks were
married - probably in May, 1859 - and went to
Europe on their wedding trip. This was in ful-
fillment of Keitt's many offers to give up pub-
lic life and make a European tour of indefinite
length if Sue would re him. On her

 

 
- KEITT, Laurence Massillon Sketch, 4

part it was Sue's ambitt#on to live in Europe,
teavel extensively, and study art. Keitt, how-
ever, in spite of former promises, felt that he
must be back in Washington for the opening of
Congress in December, 1859. Sue was very un-
happy and bitter aout leaving Europe, and thr-
oughout that winter expressed great dissatisfac-

 

tion with life &n Washington. Slowly, she bega
to take an interest in politics and in March,
1860, wrote a long Letter pushing Keitt for vice
prestdential nomination.

Their first daughter, Anna, was born in May,

1860, and the second, e on December 15,

 
KEITT, Laurence Massillon Sketch, 5
1861.

The later letters are chiefly from Keitt
while he was in the Confederate Army. They con
tain intelligent discussion of battle, campaigns
strategy, and politi¢s. Of particular interest
is his mention of some desertion and mutiny am-
ong the troops in January, 1864; his promisé not
to purchase more Negroes - he then had 115; his
comment on good conditions at his plantation;
and his description of unloading a blockade run-
ner under fire in Charleston harbor. The last
letters of the collection are condolence on

Keith's death. @

 

 
KEITT, Laurence Massillon Sketch, 6

The letters show Keitt as a somewhat bombas-—
tic, but ambitious and eloquent you man. The
comment on pol’ tics and the numeraus stirring
events of the 1850's is not extensive, but it is
valuable as far as it exists. The war letters
show Keitt a man of more mature jJudg$ment, and
of souhd opinion on the issues involved in the
war. For a man who died at the age of forty
Keitt had attained a distinguished position and
a notable place in public life. There are an
occasional mention of William Gilmore Simms with
whom Keitt seemed to be on intimate terms. Ther

are typewritten —_ i most of these lett-

This collection consists of the letters and
other papers of the related Wadlington,
Bauskett, and Keitt families of Newberry County,
South Carolina. (See the genealogical chart
filed in the first box of the collection).

Bauskett Wadlington, a planter, and J. L.
Keitt, a farmer, attorney, and member of the
South Carolina legislature,

 
Keitt, Thomas Ellison 2
The letters, 1817- 1907, are primarily social
and personal in nature. There is some infor-
mation, though, on slave sales and purchases,
cotton mills, smallpox, and Charleston, Civil
War letters are largely those of Captain
Ellison Summerfield Keitt, who commanded Co, M,
20th Regiment of S. C. Troops and later in the
war took command of Co. B, 19th Cavalry
Battalion, Also contained in the papers are the
complete muster rolls, 1863, of Co. M, 20th
Regiment of S. ©. Troops. Correspondents

Thomas W. Keitt, Thomas Ellison Keitt, Laurencd
Massillon Keitt, Harriet (Sondley) Wadlington,
Ann (Bauskett) Wadlington, and William W.
Boyce, a Confederate Congressman from South
Carolina.

 

The legal papers, which span the years
1770- 1913, consist of indentures, wills, deeds
plats, summonses, and records of trial and
judgment, Part of these papers concern Thomas
Bauskett's duties as a lawyer and those of

 
Keitt, Thomas Ellison

 

James Wadlington, who was a judge.

Promissory notes, bills, and receipts com-
prise the financial papers, 1768-1902. In
these papers there are also two small account
books: one of Sarah Cates' children, 1819,
and one owned by Thomas Bauskett, 1792.

The various papers contained in the miscel-

lany include a lecture on geography; a medical
prescription for epilepsy; a prayer; various
writings on philosophy, death, the intellect,
and government; and a speech on missions in

 
Keitt, Thomas Ellison
China, Africa, Japan, and India.

The items in the printed material and clip-
pings relate both to the Wadlington-Keitt
families and to other subjects. Contained in
this section are a reprint of an editorial in
The Piedmont Headlight supporting Thomas W.
Keitt for Superintendent of Education, a clip-
ping entitled, "Lawrence Keitt, the Fire-Eater
Who Practiced What He Preached," and letters
concerning T. B. Wadlington's class attendance
at South Carolina College. Included also is a
pamphlet written by Thomas Ellison Keitt en-
titled, The Formation _ of Sugars and Starch in

 

 

 

 

 
Keitt, Thomas Ellison
the Sweet Potato, Of interest is a printed
letter, For Confidential Circulation Among
Members of the Secession Party, dated
October 24, 1651, which contains information
on the Union party and the secession movement
in South Carolina, Clippings contain informa-
tion on Tammany Hall, the Salvation Army, Lord
Randolph Churchill, William Booth, Henry George,
and H. Clay Bascom.

Most of the volumes are financial in nature.
The Ledger, 1758-1803, apparently belonged to
Thomas Wadlington, Sr. The record of his

 

 

 

 

 
Keitt, Thomas Ellison ae:

 

family's births and deaths appearson f. 116
and on the two folios preceding the last folio
of eighteenth century accounts. The greater
portion of the ledger records mercantile ac-
counts of 1758-1763. Another of the volumes
is a Record of the Inventory of James Wadling-
ton's estate, 1831-1850. It contains an

appraisal of his estate on pages 35-37. There
is an Account Book, 1831-1879, owned by Ann
(Bauskett) Wadlington and comprised of mercan-
tile accounts. Also included is a record of

 
Keitt, Thomas Ellison 8
the money paid by Ann (B.) Wadlington during
1844 as guardian for Caroline James Wadlington.
There are four Farm Account Books, 1931,
1932-1934, 1935-1936, 1937-1939, which probably
belonged to Mrs. Thomas Wadlington Keitt.
These account books contain various farm records
but, for the most part, record the wages paid
to agricultural laborers in the 1930's. Also
included in the volume, 1932-1934, pp. 6-8,
are records of the amounts subscribed to the
Methodist Church at Clemson and of the money

 

 
Keitt, Thomas Ellison 9
received. These account books would be valuable
for the study of agricultural labor in South
Carolina during this period.

The final volume is an Arithmetic, ca.
1788-1822.

Sir George William Kekewich (1841-1921),
British civil servant, was secretary of the
Privy Council's committee on education, 1890-
1900, the Science and Art tert 1899-1900,
and the Board of Education,

900-1903. He
served in the House of Commons as a Liberal
during 1906-1910.

This collection of letters addressed to

Kekewich almost ne pose | concerns his work with
educational administration and legislation

 
 

Kekewich, Sir George William 2
during 1890-1902. Until 1899 the Department

of Education was a committee of the Privy
Council. In that year Parliament abolished the
committee and established the Board of Educa-
tion. There are series of letters from four of
Kekewich's superiors: Lord Cranbrook and the
Duke of Devonshire who were lord presidents of

the Privy Council during 1885-1892 and 1895-1902
respectively; and two successive vice presidents
of the Council's committee on education, Sir
Arthur Herbert Dyke Acland, 1892-1895, and Sir

 
Kekewich, Sir George William 3
John Eldon Gorst, 1895-1507. Their letters are

the heart of the collection, but there are also
numerous other correspondents.

The content of the letters ranges from
details about local schools, administrative
matters, and personnel to the consideration of
educational policy, parliamentary legislation,

 

and the organization of the Privy Council's
committee on education and the Board of Educa-
tion. Elementary and secondary schools were

the principal concerns, and university

 
 

Kekewich, Sir George William 4
education was not rr 8 Occasionally
other schools, such as evening and training
schools, were mentioned. The national require-
ments for schools put considerable stress upon
church schools, and the Anglicans and Catholics
were vocal in their response. Their problems
and religious instruction were frequent topics.

There are letters from a number of Anglican,
and also Catholic, prelates, but they often
wrote only about particular schools or problems.

The correspondents are: Sir Arthur Acland,

Family correspondence of John M. Kell (1823-
1900), U. S. naval officer, executive officer of
C. S. S. Sumter and Alabama, and captain of the
Confederate ironclad Richmond, consisting
altogether of letters from Kell to his mother,

Marjorie Spalding (Baillie) Kell; to his wife,
Julia Blanche (Munroe) Kell; and a few to his
Sisters. Beginning with Kell's first absence
from home after his receiving a midshipman's

warrant in 1841, his letters cover the period

 
Kell, John McIntosh

of his service in the U. 5. Navy and in the Son
federate Navy. There are some chronological
gaps in the correspondence, generally not exceed
ing two years, but the occasional summarizing
letters at the end of long cruises make the
story of Kell's activities somewhat complete,

 

The letters include names of ships on which Kell
served; accounts of cruises; references to social]
activities on board ship and on land, especially
at the Warrington Navy Yard near Pensacola,
Florida; references to Commodore Matthew C.
Perry and methods for e°” a treaty with

 
Kell, John McIntosh ts)
Japan; a description of the funeral of Commodore
Alexander James Dallas in the bay of Callao,
Peru, and near-by Bonavista; the countryside in
the vinicity of Cape town, South Africa; de-
scriptions of Montevideo, Uruguay, accounts of
customs there and references to President Carlos
Antonio Lopez of Paraguay in 1858; and many com-

 

ments regarding naval duties and officers,
After 1860 Kell's letters are concerned with
his resignation from the U. S. Navy and his
duties with the Confederate Navy. Included are
references to the ““6e° Navy Yard and its

 
Kell, John McIntosh 4&
seizure by the state of Florida; Kell's pro-

spective command of the C. 8. 8. Everglade; con-
dition of the C. 8. 8. Savannah when es Took

command temporarily in I861; running the block-
ade on C. 8. S. Sumter from July 2, 1861, until
June 17, 1862, and abandonment of the Sumter at

 

Gibraltar as unfit for further service; his sub-
sequent duties on board the C, S. 8S. Alabama
under Captain Raphael Semmes and a graphic
description of the capture of the Alabama's
fifty-sixth prize near Cape Town, South Africa;
a brief stay at Nassau, N. P., in the Bahama

 
Kell, John McIntosh
Slands; and several letters describing his
duties as commander of the ironclad Richmond
under Rear Admiral Raphael Semmes of the James
River Squadron from Jan, to Mar. , 1865,
Among the personal and family matters, Kell's
letters contain numerous references to agricul-

 

tural conditions in Ga.; Sapelo Island off the
coast of Ga.; his counsin Thomas Spalding and
Spalding's son, Randolph, who married Kell's
sister, Evy; his children; and his mother, In-
Cluded also are an album, 1853-1855, and scrap-
books, 1863, 1904, of Julia Blanche (Munroe)

The pre-Civil War manuscripts consist pri-
marily of the correspondence and business papers
of the Munroe family of Macon, Georgia. They
center around Nathan Campbell Munroe, Tabitha

 

 

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh Z
Easter (Napier) Munroe, his wife, and Julia
Blanche (munroe) Kell, their daughter. Other
members of the immediate family and numerous
friends and relatives are also represented in
the collection. After the marriage of Blanche
Munroe to John McIntosh Kell in 1856, his let-
ters and those of the Kell family are numerous.

 

Personal letters from members of several related,
prominent families are scattered throughout
collection -- the Varners, Spaldings,
McIntoshes and Napiers, The letters after

 
Kell, John McIntosh 8
T890 concern Kell and his wife almost
exclusively. The Civil War letters are usually
personal correspondence. The large group
of bills and receipts belong to Nathan C. Munroe.
The volume contains records from the U. S.
Frigate Savannah during Kell's service with it

on two separate tours of duty--1843-1844 and
1845-1847.

 

The sixty-three letters from the 1830's
primarily concern personal and family matters.
Besides the Munroes at Macon, the correspondence

includes the Hendley Varners of McDonough in

 
Kell, John McIntosh 9
Henry County. Mrs. Varner is the sister of
Tabitha Munroe; therefore there are many letters
from these two towns from the 1830's until the
Civil War, but information about them is infre-
quent.

Nathan Munroe's father and stepmother live
in Dresden, New York, from where the stepmother

 

writes in two letters of July 14 and September
18, 1833. In the summer of 1833 Natvan visits
his father in New York. For use on this trip
he has letters of introduction from Wilson

Lumpkin, Governor of Georgia, to several Northern

 
Kell, John McIntosh 10
politicians--Churchill Caldom Cambreleng, U. S.
Representative from N. Y., Silas Wright, Jr.,
Senator from N.Y., and Edward Everett, U. S.
Representative from Massachusetts.

On Nov. 2, 1833, Marcus Claudius Marcellus
Hammond, a cadet at West Point and member of
the Hammond family of South Carolina, receives
a letter from his sister Caroline.

There is a letter of Nov. 23, 1838, to John
McIntosh Kell from his mother, Marjorie Spalding
(Baillie) Kell.

Two of Nathan Munroe's letters to

 

 
Kell, John “cIntosh Le
Hendley Varner concern Georgia politics. on
Oct. 9, 1834, he compliments Varner on his
election to the Georgia House of Representatives
from Henry County. On Oct. 3, 1837, Munroe
comments on the closely contested election in
Bibb. County for the state legislature.

The 143 items from the 1840's are also
primarily personal letters, but a few of them
concern politics, railroads, education, and the
Episcopal Church. On Sept. 10, 1841, Munroe
and his Democratic friends anticipate success

in Jones County and are hopeful of carrying Bibb

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 12
and Houston counties. He expects a close

division of parties in the legislature. Munroe
comments on the discordant elements of the Whig
Party, the Whig dissatisfaction that will occur
if President Taylor vetoes the Second Bank Bill,
and the effect of such a veto on the fall '
elections. He cautions Varner to be silent on

 

the bank question and remarks that three more
years of an unsound currency will be ruinous
for Georgia. On Oct. 18, 1841, Munroe writes
that the "Democrats are going ahead everywhere

and seem to be getting back to the sound

condition in which Jackson left them." On Sept.
29, 1843, he notes excitement about the coming
elections and predicts a Democratic victory

in Bibb County.

Railroad construction in Georgia is a topic
in several letters. On July 20, 1842, Munroe
mentions the signing of a contract with Collins
and Alexander for the completion of the Monroe
Railroad and predicts success within a year.

By July 12, 1843, the Central Railroad is
finished to within a few miles of Macon and a

train from Savennah is expected on the next

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 14
day. A- letter of March 18, 1846, indicates that
Munroe was one of the directors of the Macon and
Western Railroad. On Dec. 7, 1847, Ker Boyce,
probably the merchant of Charleston, discusses
the controversy over the construction of a line
from Augusta to the eighty-one mile station of
the Central Railroad. Boyce writes from the

 

Senate Chamber in Milledgeville. He has offered
to build this railroad, and opposition to the
proposal has-come from Savannah and Macon, the
latter case being a surprise to Boyce who expects
Macon to benefit from more markets. He severely

 
Kell, John McIntosh 15
criticizes Savannah for its opposition which he
says is prompted by fear of losing trade to
Charleston. The bills and receipts include many
items with freight charges on the Central Rail-
road.

The Munroes are Episcopalians, and Nathan is
a@ prominent member of Christ Church Parish at

 

Macon. Seneca G. Bragg, rector of the parish,
is noted often in the correspondence, and there
are some personal letters from him (see the
Autograph File). Bragg's sermon at Montpelier

Institute on March 24, 1850, is filed in the

 
Kell, John McIntosh 16
miscellaneous papers, and a copy of his will of
Oct. 6, 1853, ig in the legal papers. Joseph A.
Shanklin, Bragg s successor at Christ Church, is
noted occasionally. In 1843 Nathan Munroe is

a lay delegate to the diocesan convention at
Savannah which he discusses on May 5. On Feb.
8, 1841, L. E. Cairns writes to Mrs. Munroe
about the Georgia Female Missionary Association
and plans for a central organization that would
raise funds for the Diocese of Georgia. A use-
ful volume is Oliver J. Hart, The History of
Christ Church Parish, Macon, Georgia (Macon,

1925).

During the latter 1840's and early 1850's
Julia Blanche Munroe attends school at Montpelie
Institute, a female seminary that was established
by Bishop Stephen Elliott in Monroe County.
Letters from Blanche Munroe at Montpelier
Institute are numerous, and occasionally she
comments on her studies and life at school.

Her letters from the 1850's are more informative
than the earlier ones. Some of the useful
letters are those of Jan. 14, 1850, and Apr. 14,

Apr. __, and Sept. 15, 1851. Im 1846 Seneca

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 18

G. Bragg leaves Macon and resides at Montpelier,
and both he and Bishop Elliott are often noted
in the family correspondence, though seldom in
detail. In the printed material are twelve
monthly reports for Blanche Munroe at Montpelier
Institute in 1849-1851, 1853, and 1855. Among
the bills and receipts there are tuition and

 

other receipts from the school from 1844 to 1850.
They are filed in a special folder for receipts
from educational institutions.

In 1841 to 1844 there are a few letters

 
Kell, John McIntosh 19

from Martha Rowena Munroe, who is attending
Salem Female Academy in Salem, North Carolina.
She comments on her life and studies at the
school on Nov. 4, 1841, June 22, Sept. 12,. 1843,
Mar.. 22, 1844. In the’ folder for receipts from
educational institutions there is a three-page
account for Harriet T. Munroe's residence at the
academy from 1841 to 1844. Another three-page

 

account, partially destroyed, may be for Martha
Rowena Munroe. There is also a list of the
expenses for bringing the children home to

Macon from Salem. On Aug. 19, 1850, Sophie S.

 
Kell, John McIntosh \ 20
Council, a friend of Mrs. Munroe, writes from
Salem. She praises the Salem Female Academy
and records her reactions to the social life of
the Moravians.

In 1849 Nathan Munroe visits Toccoa and
Tallulah falls in northern Georgia. He comments
on the climate at Gainesville, Hall County, and
the character of the countryside and its inhabi-
tants. This region is popular with travelers
who are visiting Gainesville, Clarksville, the
falls, and other nearby resorts. See Munroe's

letters of August, 1849. On Oct. 10, 1849, Mr.

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 21
Gordon, owner of Gordon Springs, requests a loan
for further expansion of his resort facilities.
In August, 1851, Blanche Munroe describes her
visit to Stone Mountain.

On August 24, 1849, Nathan Munroe remarks
on the unusual celebration and procession of the
Sons of Temperance in Macon on that day. Earlie

 

on August 14 he noted their flourishing organi-
zation at Gainesville.

In 1848 a relative is ill and a Dr. Gilbert
of Savannah is consulted. Munroe comments on

the career of Gilbert, who once practiced

 
Kell, John McIntosh 22
allopathy in South Carolina but became a convert
of homeopathy which he then practiced in Georgia
(letter of July 13, 1848).

In the mid-1840's several relatives or
friends of the Munroes attend school at Montauba
France. School and tour expenses from 1845 to
1847 are detailed for Harriet T. Munroe, Tabitha
Napier, Mary Denke, and Caroline Napier (filed
in folder for receipts fron educational institu-
tions). The correspondence includes some letters
from Europe.

Other matters of interest in the correspon-

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 25
dence of the 1540's are: Comments by John Mc-
Intosh Kell on his trip around Cape Horn oy the
U.S. Frigate Savannah(letter of Sept. 5, 1847);
and a discussion by Eliza B. Napier, a sister of
Mrs. Munroe, of her plans for a boarding school
i . small number of girls(letter of July 13,
1847).

Nathan Munroe was an official or trustee of
several educational institutions. He was the
first president of the Georgia Academy for the
Blind in 1851-1852 and was its treasurer from

1852-1868. Numerous vouchers remain from 1852-
1866, and Munroe's account as treasurer in 1856-

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 24

1857 is also preserved. in the printed material
are two undated announcements of meetings of the
trustees. Munroe was a trustee of the Bibb
County Academy which became the Macon Free Schoo
in 1858. Scattered vouchers remain from 1846 to
1858, and there are tuition receipts from 1859.
He was also a trustee of the Macon Female Acade-

 

my, now Wesleyan College, and there are a few re
ceipts for 1851-1852. In the printed material
there is a form letter, a request for funds,
from the academy on March 18, 1853. A few tui-

tion and other receipts are from Vineville Semi-
nary, 1844-1846, the Home Institute (Macon), 1858,

 
Kell, John McIntosh 25
Georgia Military Institute, 1661, and University
High School(Athens), 1862.

The Virginia Institution for the Blind is
represented by a printed form letter(3 pp.) of
Oct. 18, 1842. It contains a letter of explana-
tion about the school and its work and about the
attached form(2 pp.) which is designed to obtain
more data on the blind than is given in the cen-
sus returns. ;

In January, 1845, Thomas Butler King, U. S.
Representative from Georgia, and Charles Spal-

ding, fight a duel, and their correspondence
about it extends from Nov. 21, 1844 to Jan. 6,

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 25-A
1845. Spalding has publicly attacked King for
voting for the policies of Henry Clay, notably
the U. S. Bank which King had previously op-
posed. The correspondence on the duel includes
Thomas F. Bryan and Charles Richard Floyd,
representatives of Spalding and King respective-
ly, and James Troup and J. H. Dilworth who
testify to its completion. The signed document
of rules for conducting the duel dates from
about Dec., 1844,

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 26
The correspondence from the 1850's centers
more on Julia Blanche Munroe than previously,
but various relatives and friends are also
represented. Nathan Munroe'ts letters are still
numerous. The notable topics are miscellaneous.
On June 17, 1858, a junior at the University
of Alabama comments sarcastically on the strain-
ed relations between the students and townspeople

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh “a?
in Tuscaloosa after an incident in which a stu-
dent was killed. The disturbances at the
university are discussed in James B. Sellers,
History of the University of Alabama (University,
Alabama, 1953), 249, 252-257. The student also
remarks on the poor scholastic reputation of the
senior class and on his examinations.

On July 29, 1850, a’newly arrived missionary

 

 

at Cavalla, near Cape Palmas, Liberia, discusses
mission work in the area and her own duties as
a teacher in a girls* school at Cavalla.

A letter of Sept. 16, 1857, from

 
Kell, John McIntosh 28
Rusheby. P. 0., Chisago County, Minnesota, has
a discussion of the northeast corner of this
county--its agricultural richness and extensive
settlenent, and the availability of river com-
munication with distant markets.

A form letter of May 3, 1853, announces an
increase in the capital stock of the Macon and
Western Rail Road Co. and contains the re-
solutions which were voted for this purpose.

A friend or relative of Blanche (Munroe)
Kell writes on Oct. 23 from the steamer Jennie

Kirk on the Alabama River and describes its

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 29

 

unsatisfactory accomodations. A vessel called
the Jennie Kirk was built in 1859, and the
letter may date between 1859 and 1865. It is
filed in the folder for undated Civil War let-
ters (1861-1865).

The Civil War correspondence is extensive
but consists primarily of personal letters

 

among the Kells, Munroes, and their relatives.
However, there are some notable exceptions as
well as scattered lesser items from army and
navy personnel. On March 18, 1862, Robert D.
Minor, Flag Lieutenant of the Merrimac, gives
details of the recent battle in Hampton Roads

 
Kell, John McIntosh 29-A
in which he participated, He relates actions of
the Monitor, Merrimac, Cumberland, Congress,
Minnesota, and other vessels. in "1860 Minor
surmises about assignment to the commands of
several warships, e@ speculates that Kell will
soon command the Savannah. On October 27, 1864,
William E. Evans, a former officer of the Sum-

 

 

ter, relates news from Charleston where he is
stationed on the Charleston. On Nov. 11, 1864,
Robert T. Chapman, a former lieutenant of the
Sumter, writes about defensive preparations at

Battery Buchanan on Confederate Point. It is

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 29-B
part of the defences of Fort Fisher.

A fragment of a letter by a soldier in the
10th Georgia Infantry, dated June 29, 1863, from
Chambersburg, Pa., describes the invasion of
Pennsylvania by Lee's army just before the
battle of Gettysburg. Two other letters from a
soldier in the 10th Georgia are filed in the

 

folder of undated Civil War letters, 1861-1865.
Capt. George Henry Preble of the U. S. S.

St. Louis recéives a letter of May 4, 1864, from

a friend in Tangier who discusses the recent

movements of the Confederate raiders Georgia

and Florida.

 
Kell, John McIntosh 30

 

The Civil War is also represented by cor-
respondence that results from the publication
in 1895 of Two Years on the Alabama by Arthur
Sinclair, an officer on this warship. His book
is the subject of letters from Richard F.
Armstrong, another officer of the Alabama,
Anna(Semmes) Bryan, daughter of Raphael Semmes,
and from Sinclair himself.

Richard F. Armstrong is a resident of
Canada when he writes a series of letters to
the. Kells from 1868 to 1904. Om Aug. 1, 1894,

Armstrong notes that Captain Littlepage

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 31

of the Bureau of Naval Records has come to
Halifax, Nova Scotia, to interview him. Little-
page has recently seen Arthur Sinclair, whose
statements provoke strong denunciations by Arm-
strong. - Sinclair's book is published in 1895,
and on Dec. 30 Anna (Semmes) Bryan asks Kell to
refute the author's charge that Semmes gave

 

battle to the Kearsarge despite the knowledge
that it was ironclad. On Jan. 16, 1896,
Armstrong sends a copy of 2 letter from the
U. S. vice-consul at Florence in 1879. The

Vice-consul records a story in which Sir

 
Kell, John McIntosh 32

 

John Burgoyne is said to have visited the
Kearsarge with a disguised Confederate officer
prior to the battle. This letter was produced
as evidence by J. Schuyler Crosby, consul at
Florence in 1879, when Armstrong denounced his
statement that the officers of the Alabama
knew about the armament of the Kearsarge.
Armstrong denies the Burgoyne story. 5 March
10 he has more harsh words for Sinclair's book.
On Aug. 7, 1896, Sinclair writes to Kell and
insists that Semmes knew that the Kearsarge
had bighted her sides with cables. According
to Sinclair, a French officer had visited the

 
Kell, John McIntosh 53
Kearsarge and had advised Semmes to avoid a bate
tle.

On March 24, 1897, Armstrong refers to the
"Malay pilot episode,” an incident that would
reflect discredit on Semmes. He advises Kell
not to mention this incident in his book. He
wants to protect Semmes's renutation despite
his feeling that he was the officer of the

 

Alabama who was most harshly treated by Semmes.
Armstrong also remarks that the confidence be-
tween John Low, an officer of the Alabama, and

Capt. Bulloch, chief Confererate naval agent

 
Kell, John McIntosh 34

in Europe, was phenomenal. Armstrong has sent

a eulogy of Low to the Veteran and Times-

Democrat in New Orleans (letter of Feb. 26, 1901)
Armstrong's letters continue until 1904,

and his remarks exhibit his bitterness toward

the United States. His attitude towzrd the Boer

War is conditioned by a comparison of the Boers'*

fight for independence with that of the Con-

federacy. He has strong words for the Grand

Army of the Republic and for any attempt at

fraternization with it by the United Confederate

Veterans (letters of Aug. 1, 1894, and March 10,

1896).

There are two letters of May 30 and June 13,
1868, from a student pe Judson Institute in ~
Marion, -Alabama(now in J. H. DeVotie MSS.).

On September 20, 1869, a Southern woman
writes of her new life in San Francisco,

The correspondence of the 1870's and 1880's
is less extensive than that of the earlier de-

cades and consists mainly of personal letters.
On October 27, 1877, Francis L. Galt, a surgeon
on the Alabama, describés his life since the
war and mentions Mer er former associates. On

March 25 and April 29, 1879, John R. Tattnall,

 
Kell, John McIntosh 35-A

 

a former naval officer, discusses plans to re-
store Confederate naval officers to the U. S.
retired list and explains why he expects U. S.
officers to be receptive to this proposal. On
Feb. 8, 1887, Kell comments on his recent meet-
ing with Senator Joseph Emerson Brown.

In the 1890's Kell is Adjutant General of

 
Kell, John McIntosh 35-B

 

Georgia. In 1890 and 1894 there are a few let-
ters from persons and groups who support Kell's
reappointment to this office. Also in 1890
there is a draft of a letter in which Kell sup-
ports the candidacy of John Brown Gordon for
the U. S. Senate. Kell has heard rumors that
opposing candidates are secretly trying to
secure pledges from the Georgia legisla-
ture and candidates for

 
Kell, John McIntosh 36
at.

 

On June 21, 1892, Lachlan H. McIntosh records
his gift to the Georgia Historical Society of
copies from daguerreotypes of Thomas Spalding,
James S. McIntosh who was killed in the Mexican
War, and General Lachlan McIntosh of the Revo-
lutionary War.

The correspondence from 1890 to 1921
primarily concerns Kell, his wife, and their
families.

The hundreds of bills and receipts of the
1820's to 1860's belonged to Nathan C. Munroe

 
Kell, John McIntosh a7
and contribute to the the data on his extensive
activities and interests. For example, they
include receipts from the many newspapers and
magazines to which he subscribed. His work in
education has been noted above, an activity whic
is better indicated by these business papers
than by his correspondence in this collection.
The printed material includes the consti-

 

tution and proceedings of a convention at Atlan-
ta on Aug. 15, 1889, of the Confederate Sur-
vivors* Association of the State of Georgia.

There is also a booklet of by-laws of the

 
Kell, John McIntosh 38
Columbus (Ga.) Benevolent Association in 1880.
Another booklet is a treatise on the character-
istics and prevention of scarlet fever which
was published in 1901 under the auspices of the
Board of Health of Columbus, Georgia.

The volume (filed with the manuscripts)
concerns Kell's service on the U. S. Frigate
Savannah in 1843-1844 and 1845-1847. The records
include the General Orders for 1843-1844 and
the General Watch and Quarter Bill for both
1843-1844 and 1845-1847. The records for these

two periods appear separately in the front ana

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 39

 

back of the volume. Members of the crew are
listed with their assigned duties. Kell served
on the Savannah in 1843-1844 under Andrew
Fitzhugh and in 1845-1847 under Commodore John
D. Sloat as he noted in his Recollections of a
Naval Lige (pp. 14-17, 22, 34-35). The names
of Fitzhugh and Sloat appear in the Watch and
Quarter Bills, evidence of the fact that these
records are from separate periods. The lists
of lieutenants are also partly different, and
one of the officers did not attain this rank

until 1846 (Johnston B. Carter).

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 40

A genealogy of the Napier family of Virginia
is filed in the miscellany.

A useful volume is John C. Butler, Historica
Record of Macon and Central Georgia (Macon,
Georgia, 1879).

N. C. Munroe was the agent at Macon for the
Mechanics Bank of Augusta and a trustee of the

 

 

Georgia Episcopal Institute, Montpelier, and of
the Bibb County Female Academy. See The Southern
Business Directory and General Commercial
Advertiser (Charleston, 1854), pp. 218, 221, 226.

 

 

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 41
1158 items and 4 volumes added, 3-6-72:
The bulk of this addition consists of letters
received by Julia Blanche (Munroe) Kell from
school friends, her family, her husband, his
relatives, and her own children. Most of the

letters contain personal and family news,
though some deal with religion, agriculture,

 

the navy, China, South America, the Civil War,
running of large cotton and rice plantations,
Negroes, reconstruction, and quack remedies.
Of particular note are the letters of Marjorie

 
Kell, John McIntosh 42
Spalding (Baillie) Kell to her son, John McIn-
tosh Kell, because they give the most informa-
tion about matters other than strictly personal
news.

Besides bills, receipts, and genealogical
material, there are numerous poems and short
stories written by Julia Blanche (Munroe) Kell
or for her.

Of the volumes, two are ships' logs kept by
Kell when he was a midshipman in the U. S. Navy
One covers 1841 to 1843 while he served on the

 

 
Kell, John McIntosh 43

U. S. S. Falmouth, and the other runs from 1843
to 1847 while he was on the U. S. S. Savannah
and the U. S. S. Shark.

A third volume is an unpublished manuscript
entitled "The Life and Letters of John McIn-
tosh Kell" and was written by Mrs. Kell in
1908. It contains many of the letters conr

 

tained in the collection and helps to fill in
some missing details despite being rather
scanty on information in the post-Civil War

period,

 
Kell, John McIntosh

 

The fourth volume is a Civil War scrapbook,
possibly compiled by Mrs. Kell, of newspaper
clippings about noted Confederate leaders from
1850-1862. The compiler pasted the clippings
in a journal of a wealthy commission merchant.
Some of the accounts are still visible, but
their dates (probably between 1810 and 1840),
and the name of the firm and its location are
unknown. The entries show that the transac-
tions often involved several thousands of dol-
lars. Trading was with coastal ports and

 
Kell, John McIntosh 45

Europe. The merchant owned a ship named Ocean
(p. 42) and noted an estate of “Uncle Warren"
(p. 44).

2 items added, 6-19-72: One item is a let-
ter (1861, Nov. 17) €oncerning the removal of
slaves and valuables inland. The other item
is a fragment of a letter or an essay concern-

ing the treatment of slaves; the author is
unknown.

A sketch of the C.S.S. Alabama belonged to
the Kells (0C:1:6).

Howard Atwood Kelly (1858-1943), was a
noted American gynecologist and surgeon, pro-
fessor, medical historian, and author, whose
career centered in Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore. His papers consist of series of
letters from E. W. Cushing, Benjamin Frantz,

 

James Y. Simpson and his family, William Halsted,
W. W. Keen, Jr., Fielding H. Garrison, D'Arcy
Power, William Welch, and Fred Huber.

The papers begin while Dr. Kelly was at the
University of Pennsylvania, (1888-1889).

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood. 2

 

Ernest Watson Cushing, Boston gynecologist and
surgeon, wrote about a dispute between Drs.
Robert Battey and Lawson Tait as to who perfor-
med the first operation for removal of normal
Ovaries as a remedy for otherwise incurable
diseases, which meant primarily, dysmenorrhoea.
Two letters on the @arly use of ether and
chloroform in obstetrical cases came from Dr.
Benjamin Frantz of Waynesboro, Pa., in 1894 and
1899. He explains where he learned in 1847 and
1848 of ether and chloroform, where he secured
samples, and his first trials in cases in 1848

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood. 3
and 1849. The 1899 letter mentions in regard to
use of chloroform, prominent local practitioners
of the day: Drs, Boggs and Robert Werner of
Gettysburg, Pa., and Drs, Fred Dorsey, Sr., and
Charles Magill of Hagerstown, Md. Much oppo-
sition by physicians to the use of chloroform
he traces to Dr. Charles Delucena Meigs (1793-
1869), Professor of Obstetrics in Jefferson
Medical College.

A notable series. of letters came to Dr. Kelly
from William Henry Welch (1850-1934), distin-
guished pathologist, professor and dean of the

 

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood %
edical faculty at the Johns Hopkins University,
Director of its School of Hygiene and Public
Health md medical historian and author. Kelly
came to the Johns Hopkins Medical School when it
opened in 1889, together with William Osler,
William Halsted, and William Welch. The
letters reveal much of the gracious personality
of Dr. Welch and the long friendship of the
two men. On July 26, 1900, Welch writes to
Kelly in regard to keeping gynecologist Thomas
Stephen Cullen at the Johns Hapkins. In the
controversy over who first discovered the

 

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood 5
anaesthetic properties of ether, Dr. Welch held,
on Jan. 9, 1902, that discovery must date from
publication; therefore, W. T. G. Morton is the
discoverer who published long before W. C. Long
or Wells. But he thought a memorial to Long
was good, because he too deserved credit for his
work. Aside from a few gynecological questions,
many of the Welch letters are invitations for
dinners honoring famous physicians and scientiste
He suggested in 1912 names for Dr. Kelly's work
on American Medical Botonists. Incidental notes
on the medical staff of the Johns Hopkins are

 

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood

contained in the letter, In 1916 Dr. Welch
wrote with approval of the work of medical
migégionaries. On April 24, 1917, Welch comments
on the excellen? work of Dr. Kelly's department
and the freedom of action within the medical
departments. At this time World War I references
begin. On June 7 Welch describes meeting the
Johns Hopkins medical unit under ?Dr. Bridgman
in New York. He is serving in an investigation
of conditions on the naval hospital ship
Solace,and he blames much of the confusion in
medical affairs in the Armed Forces on neglect

 

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood . 7
of Congress to provide funds and authority.
Health conditions in naval training stations,
particularly at Norfolk, are found to be bad.

He finds a great need for women nurses on hos-
pital ships. On Oct. 5, 1917, Welch discussed
the appointment of Dr. Von Pirquet of Vienna for
the Children's Hospital. The Wymen case in the

 

U. S. Army Medical Corps involving medical
ethics is reviewed on Oct. 18, 1917. Howa
decision will be arrived at in this case is ex-
plained on Nov. 2, 1917, when Dr. Welch tells
Kelly of the large number of applications for

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood 8

 

commissions in the U. S. Army Medical Reserve
Corps.

Dr. Kelly was about to retire from the
Johns Hopkins in Dec., 1918, when Dr. Welch
wrote to him an appreciation of his role in
the medical school. Short letters at this time
tells of Dr. Welch's world-wide activities. On

July 9, 1925, he speaks of William Halsted,
whose home Kelly is visiting. Welch then re-
viewed Cushing's life of Osler, and comments on
the roles of Osler and Kelly in the formation
of the Johns Hopkins Medical School. In 1930-

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood g
1931 the letters come from the Institute of the
History of Medicine and the William Welch Medi-
cal Library, to which Kelly is making large
contributions. In a fine tribute to Dr. Kelly
on Feb. 20, 1933, Dr. Welch writes a memoir on
the founding of the Johns Hopkins Medical School
Anecdotes of Sir William Oster at that time are
given.

The letters conclude with a comment on
medical publication during the depression, when
Dr. Kate Campbell (Hurd) Mead (1867-1941), was
hoping to publish Women In Medicine. A pamphlet

 

 

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood LO
On the Hospital of the Résurrection of Hope for
Lepers, Kumamoto, S. Japan, is included.
Beginning in 1899 Dr. Kelly corresponded with
the family of the distinguished Scottish obstetm
Cian, Sir James Young Simpson (1811-1870), who
first used chloroform in an obstetrical case on
Nov. 15, 1847, in Edinburgh, Scotland. (Kelly's
interest in Simpson parallels his correspondence
with Dr. Benjamin Frantz who first used chloro-
form in the Cumberland Valley of Pa. in 1848),

The Simpson letters to Kelly are friendly, per-
sonal papers giving family news and revealing

 

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood pI ee
their deep religious fervor. An undated note
from D. B. H. tells of sending to Dr. Kelly
manuscripts written by Sir James Y. Simpson

and given to D. B. H. by his daughter, Miss

Eve Blantyre Simpson. Some pamphlets are
mentioned. Miss Simpson also sent to Kelly a
number of family pictures. (See Simpson Picture

 

File). Sir Alexander Russell Simpson was the
nephew of Sir Jas. Y. Simpson and his letters
show a close tie with Dr. Kelly, who visited his
Edinburgh home. The children of A. R. Simpson
visited in the United States. Jas. Y. Simpson

 
Kelly, Howard Atwoo 12
b. 1873 and presumably the son "Jin" of A. R.

Simpson) writes in 1923 of his activity in the
British Foreign Office. A group picture made in
1898 in Edinburgh shows the great gynecologists
of the day with Sir Alex. R. Simpson. (See
A. R. Simpson Picture File).

The Simpson MSS. with a few notes in Howard

 

Kelly's handwriting are in the Jas. Young Simpso
Papers.

William Steward Halsted (1852-1922), distin-
guished surgeon and friend of William H. Welch,
eame to the Johns Hoplins when it opened its

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood 13
medical school in 1869, and remained as professa
of surgery to train a succession of young, able
surgeons. His letters to Kelly begin on Oct. 7,
1906, when he comments on gynecological surgery.
He also refers to Dr. Alban Goldsmith on Jan. 5,
1921. Halsted refers to astronomy and Sir John
Herschel in several letters. Dr. Kelly sent him

 

books, and he wrote to thank and comment. Again
as in the William Welch letters, the dinner
invitations reveal the names of many great
physicians who came to the John Hoplins.

William Williams Keen, Jr. of Philadelphia,

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood 14
Pennsylvania, a prolific writer, asked in 1908
for data on the yellow fever tests of 1900 in
Havana, Cuba, during which Dr. Jesse Lezear dies
In 1918 he wrote commenting on the "Federation
of Anti-Vivisection Societies." He also commentg
on evolution in 1922 and on Roman Catholicism

in 1924,

 

A series of letters from Fielding H. Garrison
(1870-1935), begins on April 30, 1915. Dr.
Garrison, a Lt. Col. in the Medical Corps, U. Ss.
Army, served many years in the Surgeon General's
Office in the Medical Museum and Library. He

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood _ 15
edited the Index Medicus and the Quarterly
Index Medicus. His letters to Dr. Kelly show
an interest in medical history and publications
and reveal the personality of their writer. In
1915 he refers to his history of Medicine. Dr.
Kelly consulted him in 1918 on the identity of
the first American to do "genuine" laboratory
work. Kelly was writing a paper:on John Richard
son Young (1782-1804) whose thesis in 1802 made
an experimental inquiry into the digestive pre-
cesses. Dr. Garrison gently reminded him of
Dr. John Leigh of Virginia who published his

 

 

 
Kelly, Howara Atwood 16
experimental work in 1786. In 1920 there is
correspondence on helping Cushing collect mater=
ial for his life of Osler, on Dr. Edward Clark
Streeter of Boston, and on Kelly's Cyclopedia of
American Medical Biography. An account on Jan.
6,1925, deseribes Philippino social life, cus-,
toms, and travel after Dr. Garrison returns.”
He refers to the Spanish medical profession
there, as well as the "riff-raff" Americans in
the East. On Feb. 21, 1930, Garrison writes of
his appointment as librarian to the William
Welch Medical Library at the Johns Hopkins

 

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood 17

 

University. In 1934 he gives a beautiful des-
cription of Kelly's religious faith and his own
beliefs. A comment is made on Dr. Sigerist on
Jan. 28, 1935.
The D'Arcy Power letters in 1930-1931 are
social and refer to Power's visit to Baltimore.
A letter in 1933 from Frederick Huber,

Municipal Director of Music in Baltimore, des-
cribes the nusical knowledge of Dr. William

Welch.

 
Kelly, Howard Atwood 18

 

2 items, added l-7-06, are a letter from
Herbert Spencer Jennings of the Zoology
Department of Jdins Hopkins University to Dr.
Kelly, together with a reprint of the article,
"Diverse Doctrines of Evolution, Their Relation
to the Practice of Science and Life." (See
Science, Jan. 14, 1927, Vol. LXV, no. 1072,

pp. 19-25.) The address of Dr. Jennings on
"Emergent Evolution,” delivered on Dec. 28,

This collection is a combination of the
collections of John N. Kelly, Ann Kelly, and
Neill Kelly, all of Bladen County, N. C. Neill
was an uncle of John N. and seems to have been
related to both.

Some papers of the 1830's show that Neill

and his brother, David, were schoolteachers.
Their other brothers included: Archibald and
James. The latter, who lived from 1832 to 1906,
was a teacher and a Presbyterian minister.

 
Kelly, John N. 2

As a C. S. Col., Neill commanded the 41st
Regt. of N. C. Cav. Vols., a State militia out-
fit, in 1861 and 1862.

John N. was a Democrat, a Presbyterian, and
possibly an attorney, He had an active interest
in his relatives in and out of N. C., and in
political and other matters in Bladen County,
N. Ceo

During the Civil War he served in the 36th
Regt. of N. C. Artillery Vols. He was commis-
sioned a 2nd Lt. from Moore County, N. C., on

e

 

 
Kelly, John N. beets
Sept. 10, 1561. It might be remarked, in pas-
sing, that a number of Moore County people figure
in this collection. ‘Some other Kellys served

in the same company. John N. seems to have

been at Fort Fisher, N. C. from 1863 until its
capture by Union forces on Jan. 15, 1865, where-
upon he and some other Kellys were made

 

prisoners-of-war. Some of the postbellum cor-
respondence deals with Ft. Fisher.

Some of the Kelly kin stayed in N. C. Some
went to S. C., Ga., and Fla., of these, some were
in the turpentine business in Ga. and Fla.;

Kelly, John N.

 

driven out and Civil War is feared. There are
other letters, too.

Daniel Kelly writes on Dec. 3, 1860 from
Wayne County, Miss., about the national crisis.
U. S. President-Elect Abraham Lincoln (1809-
1865), he contends, will consummate the "Black
Republican" plan. Miss. will not submit. Civil
War is a last resort.

Neill Kelly writes on Aprl 29, 1862 about
the question of what to do with the Quakers, who

object to warfare.

 
Kelly, John N. 6

A number of post-bellum letters in this
collection are by a prominent Norfolk, Va.,
businessman and politician, William Lamb (1835-
1909), who from 1863 to 1865, with the rank of
C. S. Army Col., commanded the 36th Regt. of
N. C. Artillery Vols., at Fort Fisher, N. C.
John N. Kelly was a Lt. in this Regt. The Fort

 

was captured by the Federals on Jan. 15,

1865. The next day Kelly wrote that his
comrades and he were prisoners-of-war. C. M.
and D. Kelly, presumably relatives from the same

 
Kelly, John N. 7

 

Regt., write on the 24th that they are P. O. W.’

Kelly, John N. 14

 

Ft. Fisher and Col. Lamb are discussed in
an undated letter to The (Wilmington, N. C.)
Daily Review.

A clipping from The Daily Review, of Wil-
mington, N. C., contains a letter from former
C. S. Col. William Lamb to the editor, Josh. T.
James. Lamb maintains that he, not C. S. Gen.

 

 

W. H. C. Whiting, had commanded Ft. Fisher, N.
C., and quotes from four items by Whiting, one
of them a letter to C. S. Gen. R. E. Lee, and
from U. S. Lt. Col. George Francis Towle (da.
1900), to prove his point. In one letter

 
Kelly, John N. 15

 

Whiting recommends that C. S. President Jeffer-
son Davis promote Lamb to the rank of Brig. Gen.
of Artillery. C. S. Gen. Braxton Bragg (1817-
1876) is blamed by Lamb for not sending rein-
forcements to Ft. Fisher, and Battery Buchanan
for deserting. See Lamb's "The Defense of

Lawrenceville, Brunswick Co., Va.

 

Williamson Kelly was a general merchant and
retail grocer and notary public of Lawrenceville.
This collection contains mostly mercantile
accounts and letters about perSonal affairs and
the Civil War in Va. Its chief value lies in
the above average letters of Williamson Kelly's
brother. Lt. Alfred Kelly, of the 2lst Regt.
of Va. Inf. Vols.

He writes on Jan. 19, 1862, from near

 
Kelly, Williamson =
Romney, Va., about the Confederate capture of
Bath on the 4th, and Gen. Thomas Jonathan
Jackson.

This engagement was a prelude to the
Shenandoah Valley campaign of Jackson (May-June,
1862), which the Lt. discusses on May 23. In
the Battle of Front Royal on that day the lst
Regt. of Md. Inf. Vols. (Federal) was attacked
and utterly routed by the lst Regt. of Md. Inf.
Vols. (Confederate). The Federal forces at
Strasburg, Va., reportedly were routed, with

 

 
Kelly, Williamson

three regiments being surrendered. Southern
victory is complete as the cavalry is constant-
ly bringing in prisoners-of-war.

A. D. Kelly discusses Confederate casualties
and his own injury’ on Aug. 10,-1862. This was
in reference to the Battle of Cedar Mountain on
the preceding day.

 

On Oct. 3 he discusses the Battle of Antieta
and C. S. Gens. R. E. Lee and Jackson.

He writes on Dec. 4 about clothing, blankets,
and tents. The newspapers, he says, are wrong

 
Kelly, Williamson 4

 

in saying the soldiers are sorrily clad. Only

13 men of some 6,000 are barefooted. However,

hundreds lack socks. There are enough blankets

but few tents. Health conditions are discussed

in this letter and in that of Dec. 7. The 21st

Regt. was in the lst Div. of Jackson's Corps.
Lt. A. D. Kelly has one letter on the

Second Battle of Winchester. Writing from
Washington County, Md., on June 19, 1863 he
mentions C. S. Gens. Jubal A.. Early and Robert
E. Rodes and says that the troops of U. S.

eS

 
Kelly, Williamson 5 ss
Gen. Robert H. Milroy were routed from a strong
position, while many of his men and supplies
were captured.

On Oct. 24, 1863 he mentions U. S. and c. S.
troop movements; Gens. Meade and R. E. Lee and
some C. S. Quartermasters; and a mixup involving
Gens. A. P. Hill and Richard S. Ewell.

 

On May 25 Lt. A. D. Kelly discusses Con-
federate casualties and the Wilderness Campaign
(1864). His old division, he declares, has lost
all of its past renown.

have been edited for publication in a German

from the correspondence of Leibnitz in Hanover,
Germany, and the papers of Sir W. Colt and

Kemble, John Mitchell 7

 

The earliest letter written in 1829 to his
mother refers to the courageous conduct of his
father (Charles Kemble), his sister Fanny's
success, and his own work in Germany. Other
letters are to his wife and to William B. Donne
who took care of his business while he was in
Germany. A note signed "R. J. Tennant" refers
to,a Turkish ms. in the British Museum.

In 1838-1840 a British force from India
countered Russian advances in Central Asia by
deposing Dost Muhammad, Amir of Afghanistan,

 
Kemble, John Mitchell 8

 

and replacing him with Shah Shuja, heod of a
rival dynasty. At this time Lord Auckland

was Governor General of India. A five-page
manuscript on Afghan affairs is entitled,
"Heads of a conversation with J. C. H. at the
India Board. Feby. 20th 1839." It is signed,
"H. Reeve," but is apparently a copy, probably
by Kemble. J.C. H. is John Cam Hobhouse, Pre-
Ssident of the Board of Control which is re-
sponsible for Indian affairs. H. Reeve is pro-
bably Henry Reeve (1813-1895), author, who
knew Kemble and who apparently contributed to

 
Kemble, John Mitchell 9

 

the British and Foreign Review that Kemble ed-
ited from 1835 to 1844. The manuscript has

a@ number of topical paragraphs which vary in
their amount of detail. The topics include:
possible claimants to the Afghan throne; es-
tablishment of an anti-Russian league beyond
the Indus; diplomatic relations in 1838 among
Britain, Russia, Persia, and Afghanistan; terms
of the Treaty of Lahore with the Sikhs, June
26, 1838; the saving of Herat, Afghanistan, from
the Persians by Lieutenant Pottinger; the

Kemp, Laura C. Letters. — 1859-1867
Winchester, Virginia. Sketch  @9@ piece

Laura Kemp was, in 1859, a young girl away
at school for the first time. She was a student
at Cottage Hill College, an unidentified in-
stitution in Maryland, conducted by J. F. Hey.
Most of the letters were written by Laura's
mother who signed herself only as "Ma;" they

contain the usual parental admonitions together
with family news and local gossip. Laura.
remained at the school until about May 1, 1861,

at which time she had her trunk packed and was

 
KEMP, Laura C. Sketch.
anxiously awaiting her father's arrival.
tivities of the family during the Civil War are
very vague, but their sympathies were with the
Confederacy. In 1866 Laura was eagerly courted
by a man who signed himself only as Kent, but
whether she married him is uncertain. Undated
letters do show, however, that she married a phy
sician who did not meet the approval of her fami
ly. Laura's sisters and brothers included Maria
and Jimmie. These letters reveal very little of
the Kemp family, and aside from the school Det-
ters contain little of consequence or interest.

This small collection contains the corres-
pondence of Lieutenant William Kemp, of Shenan-

letters are from Kemp, writing from various
Camps near Richmond, Va. and Washington, D.C.

to his wife. These letters reveal little inform-
ation on military affairs, but relate personal
matters concerning himself and his friends in

the army, and contain a few instructions to his

wife as to the care of the grain, live stock,
and simil\ar matters. Two of the letters are
from Sarah Kemp who gave her husband a detail
description of events at home. There are also
three miscellaneous pieces in the collection.

While the collectiondoes not contain import-
ant material regarding the war of 1812, it does
give some idea of a soldiers life, his hardships

and his abiding interest in affairs at home.

Sir John Arrow Kempe (1846-1928), British
civil servant, served as: clerk in the Trea-
sury, 1867; assistant private secretary to Dis-
raeli, 1868; private secretary to Sir Stafford
Northcote when he was Chancellor of the Exche-
quer, 1874-1880; private secretary to Sir Ralph

Lingen, 1880-1881, and to Lord Frederick Caven-

1888-1894; deputy chairman of the Board of

auditor, 1904; and comptroller and auditor gen-
eral, 1904-1911. @

 
Kempe, Sir John Arrow 2

 

There is. a series of about one hundred let-
ters, 1874-1879, from Sir Stafford Northcote.
They are usually short notes with inquiries and
instructions for Kempe, his secretary. Refer-
ences to many persons and topics are included,
but they seldom exceed a few words or sentences.
They can be used as indicators of Northcote's
activities and interests. Most of the letters
were written when he was away from London.

About thirty of them are either undated or dated
only with the month and day, but probably all
of them date during the 1870's.

 
Kempe, Sir John Arrow 3

A later series of twenty-one letters, 1906-
1909, concerned details of gevernmental finan-
cial matters. The correspondents included Tho-
mas Gibson Bowles, M. P. and member of the Pub-
lic Accounts Committee, and Sir Robert Williams,
M. P, and chairman of that committee. On Nov.
9, 1909, Bowles noted some financial effects of

 

the rejection of the budget in the House of
Lords. He also referred to his part in obtain-
ing regular parliamentary debates on the reports
of the Public Accounts Committee (Jan. 23, 1906)

County, Alabama

This collection consists of a miscellaneous
group of Alabama papers. The principal figures
are Michael J. Kenan, his wife Anna B., and his
daughter Fannie. The Kenan papers begin in
1856 and are mainly legal and financial in
nature. Kenan was sheriff of Dallas County in

 

1858 and in 1861. He died before April 14,
1863, and his wife was appointed to administer
his estate. Several items dated 1863 and 1864
concern the settlement of this estate.

The remaining items are the correspondence

 
Kenan, Michael J. 2
and financial papers of various individuals in
Alabama,

A clipping from an Alabama newspaper dated
June 8, 1895, recounts céremonies held in
Chicago when a monument to the Confederate
prisoners who died at Fort Douglass was unveiled
in that city. The reverse side of this clipping
contains a letter advocating free coinage of
silver.

When this collection was recataloged, ten
(10)items and one (1) volume were pulled to
form the James Rhodes papers which appear to be

Thomas H. Kenan was aide- de-camp to
William H. T. Walker during the Civil War.
There is in this set, however, a singular
dearth of Civil War correspondence. In

 

fact, the only two letters from this period
are from Thomas' brother, Lewis Kenan. Lewt-
is may have-been the L. H. Kenan who was
secretary of the Georgia Senate in 1863 and
1864.

The first _ \ this set from the

May 19, 1867, to his fiancée, Miss Hattie
Kirtland, to whom he was married in 1868. Ke
seems to have studied medicine after the
War, but the letters never make plain from
what institution he received his degree.
There are two letters (Nov. 15, 1869,
and June 7, 1870) from a former classmate
who is practicing in N. Y. The second of
the two letters gives a granhic description
--from the medical point of view--of the
Sympténs attending a fatal case of scarlet

fever,

The letters of this collection consist
primarily of the correspondence of the S. H.
Kendall family, including some of the related
families of Arthur Byrnes and G. S. Wemble.
Dr. Seth H. Kendall was a dentist in Boston

according to city directories of the 1840's,
1850's, and 1860's. Their focus, however,
centers around the reports which Edward D., son
of S. H. Kendall, sends to his parents while he
is on his numerous travels throughout the

eastern and midwestern states as a pathfinder
and organizer for life insurance companies,
beginning with the Manhatten Life

Ins. Ce. in which his uncle Yates Kendall had
already paved the way in and near the city of
New York. His territory takes him as far north
as Chicago and Detroit and as far west as St.
Louis. But he soon tries to avoid the larger
cities, since in many of these, especially
Philadelphia and Cincinnati, there are already
strongly competing local insurance companies.
His first approach, when entering a new
city, was usually in the form of a public
lecture dealing with broader cultural interests,

often held in public school buildings

 
Kendall, Seth-H. 3

er churches. Then he followed this up with
private interviews for possible subscriptions
to policies, and for the appointment of sub-
agents to represent the company after he moved
on to other places.

Most of the Ietters deal almost wholly with
purely local or family interests. They became
rather scarce during the period of the Civil War
There is one, however, under date of April 23,
1865, that gives the reaction among some Union
soldiers th Lee's surrender. Early in the mor-

ning a national salute had been fired in honor

of the martyred president, All quarters are
heavily draped. Everybody is wearing crepe

on. the arm and rosettes on the breast. The
writer closes his letter with a postscript,
saying that a boat had just arrived with the
eagerly awaited good news from Sherman but with
the report that Davis was supposed to have
escaped.

Wadesboro, Anson County, North Carolina
W.P. Kendall is listed as a merchant at
Wadesboro in The Southern Business Directory
and General Commercial Advertiser (Charleston,
T854), p. 376. His first name, William,
appears in the miscellaneous accounts, 1841-
1849, in the back of the Daybook, 1838-1842.
The Daybook, 1838-1842, is from a mercan-
tile store at Cheraw, South Carolina, a town
about twenty miles southeast of Wadesboro.
Its connection with Kendall is unclear, but

 

 

 

 
Kendall, William P. 2
merchants by that name were still operating
there in 1854 (Directory, p. 310). W.P.
Kendall kept the miscellaneous accounts (or
part of them), 1841-1849, at the end of the
volume. Other members of the family are
involved.

There are two ledgers from Kendall's mer-
cantile store at Wadesboro for 1850-1853 and
1853-1855.

A volume of miscellaneous accounts mostly
from the 1860's also bears W.P. Kendall's

 

 
Kendall, W.P.

name. Included in the book is the text of
an undated speech (pp. 51-52, 63, 65) on the
colonization of Negroes in Africa and their
role in American civilization. It probably
dates from the late nineteenth or early
twentieth century.

Another volume has a cash account, 1856-
1859, that may have been Kendall's. He kept
accounts in the second half of the volume
during the 1860's for several estates that he

administered.

fh this brief collection the absorbing inter
est centers around the youthful soldier, George
W. Kenney, who, before reaching his 18th birth-
day but with the full approval of his parents,
responded to President Lincoln's first call for
75,000 volunteers, After a short period of

 

tPaining and organization, he left his home,
July 11, 1861, as Second Lieut. in Company P
of Col. Baker's lst Regt. of California, to
join the Army of the Potomac. Afterwards this
regiment was called the 7lst Pa. Infantry.

 
Kenney, George W. 2
About three months later, Oct. 21, orders from
superior officers were given for the poorly
prepared and ill-fated attack upon the strong-
hold of Leesburg, across the river in Va.,
which resulted in an almost complete rout of
the rear division of the Union Army. George,
who was then, in the absence of his superior
officers, in charge of his company, decided to
stay with his soldiers in spite of a good,last
Chance to escape. Soon they were all marched
under enemy orders to the gates of Libby Prison

Kenney, George W. is)

About half of the letters in this collection
were written either by or to him during the
four months of his imprisonment. They contain
primarily things of personal or locally casual
interest. He is faring quite well, has plenty
to eat, is with company of many southern offic-
ers, and reads the Richmond Daily News every
morning in the well-kept tobacco warehouse.

The only thing that really worries him
severely here arises from the fact that a
privateer, of the Savannah by the name of
Smith is held in Philadelphia for criminal

trial. In order to protect him, the Contedera
authorities have designated thirteen officer
prisoners here as hostages, to be hanged if
Smith is executed. The first victim in this
group was determined by drawing a name from a
hat, and the lot fell upon Col, Corcoran, a good
friend and associate of George's, What the out
come of this procedure was is not mentioned in
these letters,

On Washington's birthday in 1862, after the
long awaited exchange of prisoners had been

concluded, George is ry at his home in

Harrisburg, He is immediately re-enlisted in
the re-organized California regiment as a first
lieutenant in Burns! Brigade in Sedgwiék's
Division of the Army of the Potomac, now under
the generalship of Gen. George B. McClellan,
who is reported as being exceedingly popular
with the soldiers.

 

After heroically participating in the
encounters of Yorktown, Williamsburg , Fair
Oaks, and the Chickahominy, he is also present
in the disastrous Union retreat from Richmond,

usually called the Seven Days Battle, in which,

 
Kenney, George wW. 6
on June 30, he was mortally wounded by a rifle
bullet. Due to the advancing conouest of Gen.
Stonewall Jackson's troops, only a few of his
associates, and these for only a brief and

dangerous period of time, were able to see him
ina nearby Confederate hospital where he died
on July 2. He was buried in a neighboring

 

orchard under an apple tree. Over a period of
three years repeated and urgently pleading re-
guests to have him removed from enemy territory
were presistently declined until after Lee's
surrender at Appomattox when, on the head-boara

The papers of Lyman Kennon, a career. office
in the United States Army, are composed of let-
ters written to his wife, correspondence from
his superior officers, some printed materials,
and a scrapbook. As his father was killed during
the Civil War, young Kennon's formal schooling

was scanty. Nevertheless, in 1876 he won an
appointment to the U. S. Military Academy from
whence he graduated in 1881.. For details of his
service in the first years after his graduation

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere 2

 

see George W. Cullum, Biographical Hegister of
the Officers and Graduates of the U. S. Military
Academy (Boston, IS91). ard ~

In 1886 Kennon was made an aide-sde-camp of
General George Crook, who was at that time
Commander of the Department of the Platte. Ken-
non remained with the general until the latter's

 

 

death in 1890. In the following year, Lt. Ken-
non was assigned to one of the engineering par-
ties (Corps No. 1) working under the auspices
of the Intercontinental Railway Commission to
Survey a rail line from the southern border of

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere 3

 

Mexico to the extremity of South America. ,Th
official report of theativities of Kennon s
party may be found in the Report of the Surveys

 

and Explorations made by Corps No. . in Guate-
mala, El Salvador, Honduras, Niserazuse and
Costa Rica, published by the Intercontinental
Railway Commission in 1898.

In 1898 Kennon was in Florida with the
troops which were preparing to invade Cuba.
After the "liberation" of. that island, he was
on the staff of General John R. Brooke, the
military governor of Cuba. The Spanish which

 

 

 

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere 4

 

he had learned in Central America and used in
Cuba was also hélpful when in 1899 he was trans-
ferred to the Philippines where he remained un-
til 1906, serving in military, civil, and en-
gineering capacities. He left the Pacific in
1906 and for about a year was the military
attaché. to the U. S. Embassy at Petropolis, Bra-
zil. At the outbreak of World°-War I, Kennon

applied for a field command and was made a
brigadier general in the "national army," but
when his health was found to be unsuited for

overseas duty he was returned to the regular

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere .
army as a colonel. His last appointment was the
command of Camp Greene, Charlotte, North Caro-
lina, a National Guard Training Camp. In the
fall of 1918 he travelled to New York for a
medical examination and diédthere on Sept. 9.
Two days later he was buried in Arlington Nation
al Cemetery with full regimental honors. For
some of the details of his life as well as of hig
last command and his death, see The Charlotte
Observer, Sept. 10, 1918, pp. 4, 8; ibid.,

The earliest letter (April 3, 1863) in the
collection was written by Kennon's father, C. H.
Kennon, while he was stationed at Baton Rouge,
La. The next letter is dated July 9, 1876, from
General Alfred H. Terry to General George Crook,
reporting the loss of Gen. George A. Custer.

In the late 1880's there was a controversy
over the conditions under which Geronimo,
Natchez, and several other of the Chiricahua
Apache were taken into custody. The young
officer to whom they surrendered, Lt. Charles

B. Gatewood, wrote a letter (April 4, 1887) about

 

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere 7
the circumstances of the surrender and a copy
of it is among these papers. There is a pic-
ture of Gatewood in Martin F. Schmitt and Dee
Brown, Fighting Indians of the West (New York,
1948), p. 327. Kennon himself wrote an article
entitled "Ihe Case of the Chiricahuas," which
appeared in the North American Review for July,
1890.
In the same year his Manual of Guard Duty wag
published by the Riverside Press.
On March 26, 1891, Kennon was directed to

S

 

 

 

 

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere 8

 

Lynchburg, Va., on official business connected
with the publication of the Official Records
of the War of the Rebellion but he was already
en route to Cuatemala from whence he wrote to
his wife on May 14. Other letters followed
periodically, describing the heat, insects, and
conditions of life in the territories through
which he passed. In his letters of 1892,
Kennon described his work in climbing many of th
extinct volcanoes in Central America to make
triangulation readings.

As Crook's aid, Kennon had naturally been

 

 

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere 9
interested in the general's Civil War record.
Severel letters are in the collection, written
in 1895 and 1896, concerning the service of
Colonel Henry Algernon DuPont at Cedar Creek, Ne
Market, Piedmont, Lynchburg, and Winchester.

In 1898, Kennon's letters to his wife Anna
(Beecher?) are written from Tampa, Florida, where
the United States troops were preparing for a
move against Spain's possessions in the Carib-
bean. He was perturbed because he had no command
of his own; moreover, he believed that his pro-

motion was being and had been hindered by Gen-

 

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere 10
eral Nelson A. Miles, who had been involved with
Crook in the verbal disagreement about the cir-
cumstances of the capture of Geronimo and the
Chiricahuas.

Capt. Kennon's letter of July 6, 1898, in-
formed Anna of the action of his men in the
taking of Fort San Juan on July 1, 1898. Early
in the next year Kennon was a member of Gen.
Brooke's staff, and because of his knowledge
of Spanish he Was present at the meetings of
Brooke with Maximo Gémez, the leader of the
revolutionary army. Kennon's notes of the
Brooke-Gdémez interviews concerning the disposi-

 

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere pa

 

tion of the $3,000,000 given to the Cuban army
by the U. S. are included in the papers.

In mid-1899 Kennon was transferred to the
Philippines where he first saw service as a mili
tary governor of one of the provinces. During
1901 and 1902 Kennon held positions in Laoag and
Negros, P. I. In addition to the letters to
his wife, there are detailed reports of the
general situation in the areas where he was
located. There are also reports about the best
routes for roads in certain parts of the islands
On the basis of his observations Kennon wrote

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere 12

 

an article, “The Katipunan of the Philippines,"
which appeared in the North American Review for
August, 1901.
Major Kennon left the Philippines in 1905
andin the following year Sec. of War Root ap-
pointed him military attaché to the U. S. Embas-
Sy at Petropolis, Brazil. Kennon arrived in Rio

 

on June 25 and went on to Petropolis. After

a brief sojourn in Brazil, he was in Alaska

for a few months in 1908, then at Fort Benjamin
Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana, and in 1912
was in the Northwest. Although Kennon hoped

 
Kennon, Lyman Walter Vere 13

 

for a field command when the U. S$. entered World
War I, his health would not permit it. Con-
sequently, he served at several training posts,
the last being Camp Greene, Charlotte, N. C.
Among Kennon's papers is an undated draft
speech narrating General Crook's Chiricahua cam-
paign of 1883. In the scrapbook $$ included:
clippings about the Colorado-Ute War of 1887;
an article of Oct. 17, 1889, defending Gen.

G. H. Kent & Co. was a general store located
at Kent's Store, Fluvanna County. The business
is listed in Chataigne's Virginia Gazeteer and
Classified Business Directory 1890-91.

The volume is the store's Doubtful Account

 

 

Ledger, 1895-1916. It has three sections: in-
dividual accounts (17 pp.); profit and loss
account (18 pp.); and an account for claims
turned over to Sprague's Collecting Agency

 
Kent, G. H., & Co. 2

5 pp.). While doubtful accounts appear in bus-
iness account books, a ledger devoted solely

to bad debts is rare among the collections in
this repository. Unfortunately, G. H. Kent

did not provide a lot of detail in this volume.
The ledger was used mostly during 1897-1901 and

 

several years thereafter.

The blank ledger was printed and sold es-
pecially for the purpose of recording bad
debts. It is entitled Babcock's Suspense or
Doubtful Account Ledger .. . (New York: H.

Marion E. Kenworthy, a pioneer educator in psychia-
tric social work, mental health, and child guidance,
was born in Hampden, Massachusetts, in 1891. She was a
descendent of Mayflower ancestors and through her mother
was related to Ralph Waldo Emerson. She graduated from

Tufts University Medical School at the age of 22 with
honors. Dr. Kenworthy was the first female physician
at Gardner State Colony for Chronic Mental Patients in
Massachusetts where she was in charge of 2,400 female

patients. In 1917 she went to Foxborough State Hospital

 
Kenworthy, Marion Edwena 2

 

near Boston and instituted advanced care for the men-
tally i111. One innovation was a family-care program for
patients who no longer needed to be hospitalized but
were not ready to live with their families.

Dr. Kenworthy came to New York in 1917 as director
of the first mental hygience clinic of the Y. W..C. A.
A five-year grant from the Commonwealth Fund led to her

early work and study of the problems of delinquency and
emotional disturbance among children. Under her leader-
ship, the program established the first Bureau of Child
Guidance utilizing trained psychiatric social workers.

 
Kenworthy, Marion Edwena K

 

She was associated with the bureau from 1921 to 1927

and became known as the mother of the child guidance
movement. At the same time she began teaching and
lecturing at the Union Theological Seminary and at the
Mental Hygiene Institute of Connecticut College. Short]
thereafter, she became the first professor of psychiatry

at Columbia University.

Dr. Kenworthy retired as a teacher in 1957 and es-
tablished an active private practice, serving also as a
consultant to professional organizations, public agen-
cies, and foundations. She died June 26, 1980 at the

 
Kenworthy, Marion Edwena
age of 88.

Dr. Kenworthy's papers consist of correspondence
with John Hall Wheelock, poet and editor concerning his
poetry and her appreciation of it. Included in addition
to the letters to and from Wheelock are 12 clippings
about Wheelock and his poetry readings, 5 journal ar-
ticles, and a few miscellaneous items. They are arranged
in folders of correspondence, clippings, and printed
materials.

Charles Henry Bellenden Ker (17857-1871),
British legal reformer, had a distinguished
career, His practice as a conveyancer was
extensive, and his service to the law and to
the state included: membership in 1833 on the

royal commission that reported on a digest of
the criminal law and consolidation of other
statutes; authorship of the bill of 1845 amend-
ing the law of real property; headship (1853)

Pittsburg, Alleghany Co., Pennsylvania.

John Barrett Kerfoot (1816-1881) was born
in Dublin, Ireland, and came with his family
to settle in Lancaster, Pa. He studied with
William A. Muhlenberg, who became an intimate
friend and adviser. After being ordained in
the Protestant Episcopal Church, he taught
with Muhlenberg and then moved to Washington
County, Md., where he became headmaster of
St. James" Hall, later the College of St.
James. The Civil War ruined the college, and

in 1864, Kerfoot was held in hostage in

 

 
Kerfoot, John Barrett 2
Richmond by the C.S.A. government until he
was exchanged. After serving a short term
as president of Trinity College in Hartford,
Conn., Kerfoot was elected bishop of the
Diocese of Pittsburg in 1865 and held this
post until his death in 1881.

The letters comprising this collection were

 

written to Kerfoot during his residence in
Maryland. William A. Muhlenberg's six letters
reveal the closeness of his relationship to
Kerfoot. Although the letters are mainly

 
Kerfoot, John Barrett 3
personal in nature, several of them contain
information about St. Paul's College which
Muhlenberg had established on Long Island.
In a letter dated April 6, 1854, he noted that
Philip Sechaff's church history was advancing
the cause of "Evangelical Catholicism."

The remaining letters were written to

 

Kerfoot by prominent Protestant Episcopal
educators. Russell Trevett's letter of Nov.
17, 1843, contains the writer's comments on
several clergymen. Libertus Van Bokkelen

 
Kerfoot, John Barrett 4
wrote on April 16, 1844, to thank Kerfoot and
his school for an unidentified “token of
friendship" that they had sent.

William Edward Wyatt, in a letter of Nov.
15, 1847, gave Kerfoot permission to use his
name in any efforts to solicit support for
the college.

 

On Dec. 22, 1847, James Lloyd Breck wrote
to thank Kerfoot and the students at St.
James's for their contribution to the mission
house established at Nashotah Mission, Wis.

 
Kerfoot, John Barrett 5

Breck discussed the composition of his student

body and the type of work being done by the

institution. A receipt for the contribution

is enclosed in this letter.

2 items added, 12-1-72: Letters written by

J. Mason Campbell and Russell Trevett. Campbell
wrote to Kerfoot on Nov. 24, 1845, in reference

 

to a Mr. Bornsault's application for a job at
the College of St. James, where Kerfoot was
president. On Nov. 1, 1856, Trevett wrote a
letter to the Reverend S, P, Clover in which he

Edward Kershner of Clearspring, Md. was by
Oct., 1861, an assistant surgeon in the U.S,
Navy. He ementually rose to the renk of sur-
geon and medical inspector of the U.S. Navy,
but he was too independent to have a smooth
career, In 1863. a charge was preferred against

was publised in The American and Commercial

editor of that paper, appealed to Montgomery
Blair to intervene in behalf of Kershner. This
he did, and on Oct. 28, Gideon Welles, Sec. of
the Navy, wrote Kersher that the decision of

 

 

the couPtt-martial by which he was tried in June

 
Kershner, Edw. (3)

 

at Port Royal, 8. C. had been remitted and he
was to regard himself as awaiting orders.
During the remainder of his career he served
on a number of ships and in the nawy hospital
and yard of N.Y. and the navy ward at Philadel-
phia, In 1867 he was suspended by the
executive officer of the Osceola for alleged
disrespect to a superior officer. Between
them and 1895 when he was court-martialed

again and dimiscsed from service,

he was reported

three times for disobedience. By an act of
Congress he was restored in 1902 to his former
rank in the navy.

In addition to the correspondence regarding
Kershner's conduct, there are numerous orders
issued to him, sick reports, inventories of
medicines, hospital supplies, etc. on board

Letters from the family and friends of
Frank Kessler, brakeman on a railroad, and
the girl he married (1876), Nanie Jane Lewis
of Magnolia, West Virginia. The letters are
for the most part trivial and commonplace,
being concerned with turkey roasts, prayer

meetings, quilting and circuses. Of particu-
lar interest are several letters from Denison,
Texas, describing the climate, a letter tell-
ing of a fight between blacks and whites in

 
Kessler, Frank B. -2-

 

West Virginia, (1871), and a number of letters
referring to the hard times (1876) and number
of unemployed. There are also a great many
bills for coal, food, and rent. One letter
from an engineer connected with the Berkeley

Co. in West Virginia names various engines on
the line.

William Judah Keyser (1821-1877) was one of
the founders of the firm of Keyser, Judah and
Company, lumber exporters of Pensacola, Florida.
This business, established in 1857, grew into a

major concern. In addition to its principal

function of exporting, the firm also engaged to

some extent in the processing of timber.
William Judah., Keyser moved to Florida

from New England where he was born at Norwalk,

 
Keyser, William Judah LA

 

Connecticut, in 1621. He married Harriot Cowles
Swift, and their son, William Swift Keyser, was
born in 1856 at Springfield, Massachusetts.

This son graduated from Philips Andover Academy
in 1876 and from Yale College in 1880. He soon
assumed management of the business since his
father died in 1877.and Mr. Judah in 1880. The

firm then became Keyser and Company.
Biographical information about the Keysers

appears in the Florida edition of the Makers

of America (Atlanta, 1909-1911), Vol. IV, pp.

282-286.

 
Keyser, William Judah <a

Many letters during the first decades of the
business are from Milton, Florida, where William
J. Keyser was operating before, during, and afte
the Civil War. The principal office of the firm
came to be at Pemsacola, and it had branches in
other coastal cities such as Mobile and
Pascagoula.

 

The elder Keyser was preceeded in Florida by
some relatives who were merchandising as early
as the 1820's. Until his death the firm

 
Keyser, William Judah 2

 

seems to have dealt chiefly in cotton, cattle,
and lumber. During the Civil War, it seems,
little cotton and lumber were shipped.

For some years a Pensacola lawyer, William
H. Judah (d. 1879) was Keyser's business part-
ner. W. S. Keyser became president of the firm
in 1879, but did not assume active operation of

it until the next year following his graduation
from Yale ™.

Under the direction of W. S. Keyser, the
firm dealt mainly in lumber and became one of
the leading businesses in Pensacola. It was,

 
Keyser, William Judah 3
moreover, one of the world's largest exporters
of pitch pine timber. In 1900, 135,000,000
superficial feet were shipped.

The firm handled lumber from Ala., Miss., and
Texas, and shipped to New York, Liverpool, and
elsewhere.

Mrs. W. J. Keyser (née Harriot Swift) came
from the well known New England family, of which
several made the D. A. B. A number of letters
and other papers deal with her New England
connections and, later, with the English connec-
tions of her daughter, Nell. The former rela-
tionships should prove valuable to those inter-

 

 
Keyser, William Judah 3A

 

ested in postbellum North-South reconciliation.
The same may be said of the Rachel Susan (Bee)
Cheves MSS., also in this dept.

Other families discussed in this collection
include Crow (Liverpool, England), Nixon, Rives,
Trumbull, and Webster.

The first item of correspondence is a copy
of a letter of 1822 from Pensacola, by John Key-
ser to his brother, Joseph C., of Philadelphia.
He discusses cotton crops and prices; Two
American ships, the Cheves &nd the Franklin; and

a yellow fever epidemic in the Florida seaport.

 

 
Keyser, William Judah 4

 

Most antebellum letters are about personal
affairs and Fla. social life and customs.
Various members of the New England Swift family
appear in it too.

There is little Civil War material. A lette
of July 22, 1861, mentions C. S. Gen. P. G. T.
Beauregard and the First Battle of Manassas.

A letter of Nov. 22 is addressed to Joseph
C. Keyser, of the lst Regt. of Va. Cav. Vols.

Some Civil War papers indicate that W. J.
Keyser shipped many cattle for the Confederate

Army. His wife writes from “at our plantation"
to her sister about their happy home life,

friends in the North, and their son, William
Swift Keyser, Mrs. Keyser after
the war travels up North, where "Black Rupublic-
anism" is dished out to her thrice daily (letter
of Aug. 30, 1865). But she praises Abraham
Lincoln (letter of Sept. 13, 1865). She also
travels in Va.

A letter of the 20th complains of alleged
stealing by Negroes and mentions U. S. Army
occupation troops. Many other letters deal
with shipping lumber in Fla. and other
business matters during Reconstruction.

 
Keyser, William J. 6

 

Mrs. Harriet Keyser writes from Warrenton,
Va., on Aug. 8, 1866, abeut bad conditions
there. She also discussed "Extra Billy," Wil-
liam Smith (1797-1887), whose farm, in contrast,
was well cultivated. This and later letters
discuss Va. social life and customs.

A number of business letters to W. J. Key-
ser are from merchants in Bensacola, Fla.;
Havana, Cuba; New Orleans; and elsewhere; as
well as from the Pensacola law firm of William
H. Judah (d. 1879) and C. L. Le Baron.

A letter of Dec. 30, 1867) contains an

original poem.

 
Keyser, William J.

There are some letters (Dec. 17, 1868, for
instance) from Colchester, Comn., by the mother
of either Mr. or Mrs. W. J. Keyser.

A letter of Dec. 1, 1870, shows that "Willie"
S., son of Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Keyser, was atten-
ding the Charlier Institute for Young Gentlemen,
(also called Institution Elie Charlier), in New
York, N. Y. His letters tell something about
school life.

Mrs. Keyser writes to her husband on July
25, 1875, describing her trip through Europe.

Keyser, Judah, and Company, Pensacola, is

 
Keyser, William Judah 8

 

the heading of a letter dated June 30, 1877.

A letter of Aug. 25, 1882, from Liverpool,
England, discusses "Willie's" travels and ocean-
ic shipping. There are other letters about
these matters.

There are certificates issued by Dallas
(Ala.) Academy to Jemie Bender and Rose Weaver.
The ones issued to Miss Bender in 1883 and 1884
are signed by Kate Edmond. See the Kate Edmond
Papers.

Some letters of 1890 discuss Sir William

Dawson.

 
Keyser, William Judah 9

 

A number of letters from Canada in the 1890*
and later are by "Nelly" a daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. W. J. Keyser, who seems to have married an
Englishman, Peter W. Atkin, of Birkenhead, near
Liverpool, England. Letters from this family
appear as late as 1933. The Keyser firm in
Florida had many commercial relations with
Liverpool.

On April,ll, 1892, Isabella Holmes (Porter)
Bliss, wife of Edwin Elisha Bliss, noted mis-
Sionary in Turkey, writes about the serious ill-
ness of her husband who dies in December.

“he also comments about their life in Turkey.

other missionary in Scutari. A copy of the

A little material deals with the Spanish-
American War of 1898.

 

“Willie” writes on May 18, 1898, about Col.
Theodore Roosevelt.

President William McKinley is mentioned on
May 25, 1898. His death is discussed on Sept.

The papers of this collection center
around the lives of two lawvers, father and
son, John Richardson Kilby (1819-1878) and
Wilbur John Kilby (1850-1907) of Suffolk
in Nansenond County, Virginia. John Rich-
ardson Kilby especially was very successful
and han

STi |

led many cases covering the period
from 1840 to 1878. His son, although less

Successful, carried on the same work until

JUN 9 19492 ®

 
Kilby, John Hichardson Sketch (2)
1907. The papers of the collection are
largely confined to the legal activities of
the two Kilbys although there are a number
which pertain to other than legal activities.
John R. Kilby attended a school conduct-
ed by Richard H. Riddick, Commonwealth's
attorney for Nansemond Younty, and at four-
teen years of age became assistant to his
uncle John Thormson Kilby who was clerk
of court for Nansemond. ‘A few years later,
John R. Kilby became deputy sheriff of Nanse
mond and later sheriff of Norfolk County.

 

 
Kilby, John Richrrdson Sketch (2a)

 

The office of the clerk of the court of
Mansemond County was burned in Rebruary of
1866. Hence the papers of the two Kilbys,
so closely associated with the legal history
of Nansemond Gounty, are valuable for the
numbers of wills estate records, etc., which

they contain. There is much material on the
legal affairs of the Riddick Family.

During this time he studied law and was ad-
mitted to the bar in 1845. He was a member
of the Virginia Assemby in 1851-52-53, a
presidential elector in 1852, member of the
Baltimore convention which nominated Millard
Fillmore, orzanizer and president of the Com
mercial Bank of Suffolk from 1872 until 18-
78 and editor of the Suffolk Intelligencer
in 1849.
Wilbur John Kilby was educated at Ran-

Virginia and immediately began the practice
of law with his father under the firm name
of John R. Kilby & Son. From 1883 until
1886 Wilbur John Kilby was president of the
city council of Suffolk, judze in Nanse-
mond County from 1885 until 1904 and trus-

The collection also contains information
relative to land companies similar to the
Dismal Swamp Land Company. In fact, the
Riddick family, also important in the
Dismal Swamp Land Company, figures in this
collection. The files for 1870, 1882,

1885, and 1886 show that Richard H. Rid-

Land Yompany. The set also contains a
number of letters signed "Missouri," who
was the wife of Nathaniel Riddick, a mer-
chant of Pantego, N. C.

Another interesting phase of the col-
lection lies in a number of references to
work of the American Colonizetion Society.

 

A letter of William F. Wright (Feb. 1,
1850) strongly urged that a vigorous at-
temnt be made to arouse an interest among
free Negroes in the work of the American

Colonigation Society.

letter of June 26, 1856, from Randell Kil-

in the career of Wilber John Kilby.

167 items added, 6-14-49 and 212 items
added, 2-6-51. The contents of this additional
material are covered by the original sketch.

 

780 items added 2-14-52. Most of this
additional material is described in the origina
sketch. Some items that are not mentioned,
however, are: Note dated Dec. 28, 1860 regar-
ding the hire of a slave; papers relating to

 
Kilby, John RAchardson i?
Josiah Riddi¢k; will of Andrew McAlister of
Suffolk, Va. (Jan. 31, 1872); partnership con-
tracts between Leroy R. Kilby and H.P. Pope
for conducting a commission business (Apr. 19,
1875.

Four vols. of daybooks and memorandum books
were also added.

 

5075 items and 15 small volumes, added
2-14-67, are a continuation of the Kilby papers
already catalogued. The collection as a whole
contains wills and papers concerning trustee-
Ships and chancery suits which give valuable

 
Kilby, John Richardson L3
genealogical and historical data for Nansemond
Co, and vicinity. It is impossible to list all
the names involved in the papers.

The trusteeships of John R. Kilby and Wilbur
J. Kilby are reflected in all divisions of
their papers... fapers relative to the estates
of Miles Dougherty and Robert Smith are most
extensive. The widow of the latter, Sarah J.
Smith, has a.small bound volume in which a list
of her bonds was placed. John R. Kilby was
also trustee for the estate of Colonel Josiah
Riddick, but the numerous Riddick family papers

 

 
Kilby, John Richardson 14
are more scattered than those of Daugherty and
Smith. Of the Riddick children Nathaniel and
Richard H. Riddick have papers in the Manuscript
Department. Kilby was also trustee for the
Andrew McAlister and the J.C. Langhorne estates
The most extensive of a number of lists of
slaves, 1839-1858, is that of the Riddick

 

family in the undated legal papers.

During the Civil War the sloop Whisper,
seized by the Confederate government for
blockading, is the basis for claims for damages
by William B. Whitehead (See Legal Papers, 1862

 
Kilby, John Richardson i
1863).

Among the names recurring are Whitehead,
Rawls, Hasty, Norfleet, Digges, Meador,
Langhorne, and Flynn.

Printed materials are notable for broadsides
of sales of land, 1857-1902, in the Nansemond

 

area.
Fifteen small account and notebooks, personal]

instructions concerning legal and business
matters and home management as well as brief
references to troop concentrations, fighting,

Shenandoah Co., Va.

 

Dr. Frank King, a physician from New York,
purchased the Van Buren Furnace (pig iron) at
the village of that name in Shenandoah County,
Virginia. He became a resident there and is

listed as a physician in Chataigne's Virginia

Gazetteer and Classified Business Directory in
the 1870's and 1980's. There are references to
him and to the furnace in John W. Wayland's A

History of Shenandoah County. King's account
ee ae ee he-also operated iron ore

 

 
King, Frank 2
mines, a mercantile store, a blacksmith and
wagon shop, and stables. He was a considerable
property owner at the village as can be seen
from the detailed map on page 14 of D. J. Lake
& Co.'s An Atlas of Shenandoah and Page Counties

Virginia (PhiladeIphia, 1885). “The store, black

 

smith and wagon shop, the furnace, King's resi-
dence, stables, and other buildings are on the

map.

The collectign consists primarily of account
books from King’s business enterprises at the

 
King, Frank ie pean, a
village. Many of the books are from the mercan-
tile store, but there are several significant
volumes from the operation of Van Buren Furnace.
Accounts also appear from the blacksmith and
wagon shop.
Records from the pig iron and ore mining

operations of the Van Buren Furnace include the

 

Diary, April-December, 1870; that was kept for
the furnace and other businesses at the village.
One person, someone like a superintendent, made
sone | Pa the entries, but differences in hand-

i

ng show that at least one other person

wri

 
 

King, Frank Pee 4
also made entries in the diary. The Time Books,
1869-1879 and 1880-1882, list the workers and
their work record and wages. The Furnace Blast
No. 1 volume contains production records during
Dec., 1870-March, 1871, and June, 1880-July,
1882. The Stock Book, Blast No. 1, for Feb.-
March, 1871, contains two pages of furnace

records, the rest of the volume being a Cash-
book, 1879-1881, The Mercantile Ledger, 1871-
1873, and Notebook contains mostly mercantile
accounts with individuals, some of whom paid for
goods partly by labor. It also includes fourtee

pages of notes describing brick kilns and iron

furnaces and how they operated. There are a
number of small drawings. Four of the locations
of the kilns and furnaces were in Berkshire
County, Massachusetts, at Lanesboro, Cheshire,
Richmond, and Williamstown. A fifth,Hecla,

was probably the iron works of that name in

Oneida County, New York. There are also some
estimates for Van Buren Furnace, The Oversize
folder contains a large mechanical drawing of

some equipment for the furnace. The Combined

John Pendleton King (1799-1888) had a diverse
career that enabled him to attain prominence as
a lawyer, judge, senator, and businessman. His
personal fortune grew consistently until he suf-

fered heavy losses during the Civil War. He was
president of the Georgia Railroad and Banking
Company from 1841 to 1878 and of the Atlanta and
West Point Railroad. His financial interests in
cotton manufacturing were also extensive.

 
King, John Pendleton nae 2
He aligned himself with the Jacksonian Democrats
in Georgia and was appointed to the United Stateg4
Senate in 1833 to fill the unexpired term of
George M. Troup. He was elected to a full term
the following year, but resigned in 1837 when

he realized that he could not back President

Van Buren's policies to the extent that his con-
stituents preferred.

King's papers are routine correspondence and
other items related to the Georgia Railroad Com-
pany. They concern route schedules, government
ete for transporting mail, and similar to-
pics.

Pendleton King's family were residents of
Oak Ridge, N. C., where they were prominently
connected with the Oak Ridge Institute. In
1866 when the main building of the Institute
burned, John King took a prominent part in its

reconstruction,
Pendleton King had a number of brothers who
early moved to Greensboro, N. C., where they

were leading citizens. John L, King was in the
office of the treasurer of Guilford County,
while Walter W. King was attorney-at-law in
Danbury, N. C.

Pendleton King, himself, was the most prom-
inent member of the family. He went to Haver-
ford College in 1866 and later traveled in
Europe, principally Germany around 1876 to 1879
While in Germany he met Miss Helen (Nellie)
Ninde from Fort Wayne, Indiana who was studying
also. They were engaged to be married while on

 

the Continent and upon their return to the
United States were married in Fort Wayne during

Mrs. King was, without doubt, an unusually tal-
ented woman as evidenced by a letter from Scrib
ner's in March 29, 1877 rejecting her transla-
tion of "l'Arrabiata." Mention is made in a
letter of May 19, 1879 of a play which she was
either writing or translating. Quite naturally
Mrs. King was interested in social questions

such as the emancipation of women, abstinence
and the temperance movement. A most interest-
ing letter on these questions is dated Nov. 14,
1877, Other matters of national interest re-
ferred to in this collection are: election of
1876; Henry Ward SS Beecher and Thos. D.

Talmage's churches (Nov. 19, 1876), Lydia

(Nov. 21, 1877), drop in land values (Jan. 1,
1879). There are letters from a Swarthmore
student, Oct. 5,and Dec. 14, 1879.

Mrs. King corresponded with Mrs. Angeline

 

Teal of Kendallsville, Ind. who wrote occasion-
ally for the juvenile magazine, Wide Awake and
for Harper's, For an article referred to in

letters of 1879, see Harper's, vol. 60, 1879-80

ter her marriage, Mrs, King received in-

teresting letters on the contemporary and histe
rical scene in Connecticut (Sept. 5, 1880) and
of a friend's meeting with the violinist, Ed-
ward Reményi (June 28, 1881).

Mrs. King died in March 1882 and was wries
in Fort Wayne. From this time until July 1884

the correspondence is chiefly concerned with
the rearing of the children, Helen and Rush.
Most of this time the children were under the
care of Mr. John L. King and his wife, in
Greensboro. Early in 1884, Pendleton King's
daughter, Helen, “<@

Late in 1885 King went to New York where
he evidently was connected with the Democratic
Party. He wrote a book entitled Bife and Pub-
lic Service of Grower Cleveland as propaganda
material ror the election of 1684. In 1874 he
was connected with the state department in Wash-
ington, and in 1906 was American Consul at Aix-

 

 

 

 

la-Chapelle, Germany. Pendleton King's son
Rush was at this time (c. 1905) apprenticed to
a druggist, Adams, in Birmingham, Alabama.
There are a few letters from Pendleton
King's schoolmate, Stuart Woods of Philadelphia
There is mention of ‘6S substantial checks

Rugus King (1817-1891) was the son of Edward
King and the grandson of Rufus King (1755-1827),
the Federalist statesman and minister to Great
Britain. His mother, Sarah (Worthington) King
Peter, was the daughter of Thomas Worthington,

governor of Ohio and Senator from that state.
After studying at Kenyon vollezge and Harvard,
he returned to Cincinnati where he first prac-
ticed law and later became Dean of the Faculty
at the Cincianati Law School, an institution

 
King, Rufus, Papers. 2
which his father had been instrumental in estab
lishing. Like his parents, he took an interest
in various civic organizations and became a pro
minent citizen of his community. He was married
to Margaret (Rives) King wno wrote a biography
of her noted mother-in-law and a small volume
ou her Virginia ancestors. His wife's book on

 

his mother is the most comprehensive source of
information on this branch of the King family.

The letters constituting this collection were
written by thomas Worthington King (d. 13851).
Although the majority of the letters were writ-
ten bo his older brother Rufus, there are also
several letters to his mother and one to his
wife Eligabeth ("Lizzie"). T.W..King was also

 

graduated from Harvard and entered the commer-
cial business of his eastern relatives. de la-
ter located in New Orleans where he became a
broker and commission merchant. His letters
were written during his residence in this city.

 
King, “ufus, Papers. 4
A gap occurs in the correspondence. from 1845 to
1350, and Tf.W. King appears to have moved from
New Orleans during that time. The correspon-
dence ends in Februrary, 1550, and the younger
King died in January of the following year.
Family matters and business affairs are the
subjects discussed in these letters. Mrs. Pete

 

was involved in a quarrel which alienated her
first husband's brothers. The matter at issue
is not fully identified in T.W. King's letters,
but it Created much dissension within the family
King was at first reluctant to press the matter

since he hoped to maintain business connections
with nis uncles in New York. He later supported
his mother, nowever, and referred to vames Gore
King, John Alsop King, and Charles King as fam-
ily enemies. Letters of “ay 31, 1044 and April
and May, 1345 comment on this problem,

T.W. King also discussed business conditions

 

in New Orleans. Wholesale prices are stated,
as are market fluctuations in the port city.
King's career is @ocumented by many references
to his business dealings. He relied on his

writes on Sept. 2, 1852, to John MacRae of
N. C. regarding his health, and the campaign
of Franklin Pierce for the Presidency in 1852.

1 item was added 2-22-58. It is a personal
and business letter of Jan 10, 1827, from King
to J. W. White. He disbelieves the charge
of peculation made against John C. Calhoun,
whjle the latter's "bitterest efiemies instinct-
ively pronounce it “6 false." King hopes for

Willis H. King enlisted in the C.S.A. Army
in 1863, while his sons Bellfield and Whitfield
D. King began their service in 1863. The three
men served in Company G of the 11th Regiment,
N.C. Troops. Whitfield was killed soon after

he entered the Army. His father developed a
kidney condition that forced him to leave his
regiment until his health improved.

This collection consists mainly of papers

 
King, Willis H. 2
pertaining to Willis King's illness and
Whitfield's death. In a letter dated Dec. 14,
1863, Bellfield King discussed desertion in
his regiment. He also noted the increasingly
poor quantity and quality of the food given

to the soldiers.

lectman and overseer of the poor (ca. 1813),
tax assessor (ca. 1816), and justice of the

 

peace (ca. 1806-1840).

The bulk of the collection consists of legal
papers and miscellaneous bills and receipts.
The legal papers, which include wills, deeds,
indentures, affidavits _and warrants, relate

 
Kingman, Henry 2
mostly to cases heard before Kingman or other
Justices of the peace for Hampshire County. Al-
so, there are a few copies of legal pepers re-
lating to cases heard in the Court of Common
Pleas (1804, 1819, 1829), and a copy of testi-
mony given in a civil case heard in the Hamp-

 

shire County Superior Court. The bills and re-
ceipts concern personal debts and legal fees,
or deal with the purchase or sale of farm pro-
ducts or merchandise.

One item has a bearing on state politics in
Mass.: this is a “~ (Jan. 8, 1840) of the

voters of Pelham to the members of the state
legislature asking that ‘they refuse to allow
David Abercrombie to take his seat in the House

There are a few letters (1800-1846) by Henry
Kingman. But of the 64 letters in the collec
tion, more than one-half are dated 1870-1876.
These later letters concern the social life of
farmers in and around Andover, Mass., especially
that of the families of Loesa W. Button and Mrs,

Hiram H. Martindale. The letters tend to be
gossipy.

William Beatty Kingston (1837-1900),
British journalist, was a correspondent for
the Daily Telegraph in London and a member
of its editorial staff from 1879. His early
career was spent as a clerk in the Public

 

Record Office, 1852-1856, and as vice
chancellor of the Austrian consulates at
London, 1856, and at Cardiff, 1857-1865. He
was special correspondent for the Daily

 
Kingston, William Beatty 2

 

Telegraph at Berlin, Vienna, and other cities,
and he was present during the campaigns of the
Austro-Prussian, Franco-German, and Russo-
Turkish wars. Poetic contributions to

Punch, 1883-1887, musical compositions,
articles for The Lute and other musical
journals, and a number of books were among his

accomplishments. A biographical sketch
appears in Frederick Boase, Modern English
Biography (Truro, Netherton, 1892-1921), V,
826-827.

His career is evaluated in Rdward

Court, The Story of the Daily Telegraph
(London, 1955).

The collection includes letters written
to Kingston by four prominent individuals:
Sir Edwin Henry Egerton, diplomat; Henry De
Worms, First Baron Pirbright, a member of
Parliament and governmental administrator;
and from two Rumanian statesmen, Prince Ion
Ghica and Demetrius Ghica. Miscellaneous
topics include: the Russo-Turkish War in
1877; correspondents of the Daily Telegraph;

 

 

 

 

 

 
Kingston, William Beatty 4

 

political conditions in Russia and Rumania;
British foreign affairs; and other matters.
The dating of the letters must be watched
carefully, for Kingston dated their receipt
rather than their date of composition.
Edwin Egerton was a second secretary in the
British embassy at St. Petersburg when he

wrote on Sept. 10, 1877 about: Kingston's
articles on Russia and Germany; Bismarck

and his conduct of foreign policy; the Russo-
Turkish War, the Russian navy, and the

Daily Telegraph's coverage of the war;

 

 
Kingston, William Beatty

 

Russian reaction to Mackenzie Wallace's book
about their country; Francis 0. Adams, a
secretary in the Paris legation; opera; and
several other Englishmen.

The Russo-Turkish War was given further
attention on Dec. 17 and 22, 1877, by
Demetrius Ghica at Bucharest who also noted

his musical interests, the visit of Czar
Alexander II, and British consul general
Charles E. Mansfield.

Egerton reported again from Russia on

 
Kingston, William Beatty

6

 

Dec. 29, 1877, and discussed: the difficulty
of getting accurate news, even by Mackenzie
Wallace; the trials of socialists; the
possibility of revolution; taxation; and
Britain's unpopularity.

From Vienna Egerton commented on Nov. 14,
1879, about: Law's departure from the Daily

Telegraph and his knowledge of Russia; the
bad writing of Abel and of the Vienna

correspondent of the Standard; and Lavino's
accurate reporting on Egypt in contrast to

 
Kingston, William Beatty

 

that from the Telegraph's Paris agent, Sir
Campbell Clarke.

On March 11, 1880, Henry De Worms noted
his parliamentary election campaign and
replied favorably to Kingston's request for
tips on domestic and foreign affairs. on
April 3 he pondered about his future in the
House of Commons.

On Feb. 12, 1882, De Worms praised an
article by Kingston and acknowledged remarks
about himself. Later (March 15) he sent a

 

 
Kingston, William Beatty 8

 

clipping from the Gazette in Cologne and

asked that the Telegraph counteract it; German
newspapers had given considerable attention to
a speech,

On May 3, 1882, Prince Ion Ghica, the
Rumanian envoy in London, noted an article
that Kingston had sent and asserted that the
Barrere solution for the navigation of the
Danube was a difficult problem for the
Rumanian government.

The debut of a Rumanian actress was noted

on Dec. 20, 1883.

 
Kingston, William Beatty

 

Kingston was awarded the order of the
Crown of Rumania which was sent to him by
Prince Ghica (July 29, 1884).

In 1886 Egerton was a secretary in the
embassy at Constantinople when he discussed
(June 27): the Pall Mall's call for an
accounting of British naval strength; the
change of cabinets in London; Britain's
weakness in foreign affairs; India's frontier
against Russia; Lumsden's indiscretions; and
the Telegraph's last correspondent in Egypt.

Ion Ghica's letter of Nov. 23, 1655, refers
to a message from the Queen, the Serbians, and
political activity at Bucharest, apparently by
Demetrius Ghica.

Egerton commented on the expectation of a
continental war and on his belief that there
was danger of a war between France and England

 

(Dec. 26, 1886). Several years later he
remarked on the presidential election in

France (Oct. 7, 1889). In 1894 he was the
envoy in Athens, Greece, from where he reported

Edward Wilkinson Kinsley (1829- ) was a
partner in the importing firm of Horswell,
Kinsley and French. Though not a native Bos-
tonian, he moved to that city in 1548 after
being employed as a clothing salesman at stores

in Springfield, Mass., and Norwich, Conn.
Kinsley never sought public office and de-

clined permanent governmental appointments unti

13873 when Governor William B. Washburn of Mass.

 
Kinsley, Edward Wilkinson, Papers. 2
selected him as a state director of the New
York and New England Railroad Company. In 1878,
Governor Alexander H. Rice appointed him to the
board of railroad commissioners in Mass.
Kinsley's reminiscences of early railroad con-=
struction in the Northeast were printed in the
New York Times, Nov. 3, 13889.

 

 

The only biographical information thus far
found on Kinsley is in John ¥. Hand's One of a
Thousand. It appears, however, that he was well
connected in Boston, expecially with those who
shared his humanitarian interests. The papers

 
Kinsley, Edward wilkinson, Papers. 3
included in this collection indicate that he
was concerned about the plight of the free
Negro in the “outh during both the YVivil War
and Reconstruction. His activities extended
to soliciting funds for societies aiding freed
Negroes, lobbying for Yonzressional action to
grant equal pay to Negro volunteers serving
in the U.»©. Army, and personal assistance to
former slaves. we evidently supported Grant
at first but later shifted his allegiances
during the closing years of Reconstruction.

Of primary significanee in this collection

 

 
Kinsley, Edward Wilkinson 4

are the letters discussing the issue of payment
to Negro troops for military service. Kinsley
worked closely with his friend John Albion
Andrew, wartime governor of Mass., to secure
Congressional approval of a bill designed not
only to begin paying these troops, but also to
make the payments retroactive to cover the

 

volunteer's full period@ of service. The letters
of James Monroe Trotter refer to the Negroes’
attitude toward this issue. His letter of Nov.
21, 1364, describes the celebration held by the
55th MassachusettS Regiment of Colored Troops

 
Kinsley, Edward Wilkinson. be
when their salaries arrived at their camp on
Folly island, S.C. Letters from other Negro
troops also express to Kinsley the desire for
salaries as a recognition of equality as well
as due payment for services rendered.

The letters from Trotter and other Negro
soldiers document the history of the 55th Reg-
iment during its service in South Carolina and
Georgia. Among the other Negro regiments of
the U.S.Army mentioned are the 54th Massachu-
setts and the 35th and 36th Regiments of U.S.
Colored Troops. These last two units are re-

 

 
Kinsley, Edward Wilkinson 6
ferred to at times by their original names, the
lst and 2nd Regiments of North Carolina Yolun-
teers (Colored).

Trotter, a former school teacher, had enlist
-ed in the Army and held various staff positiong
He was married to the former Virginia Isaacs
who was reputed to be the granddaughter of

 

lhomas Jefferson (cf. The Negro Handbook, p.
379). Their son, William Monroe Trotter,
became a noted journalist. ‘the elder Trotter
worked in the Boston post office after the Civil
War and wrote a book on the musical interests

 

 
Kinsley, Edward Wilkinson 7Z
of his race, Music and Some Highly Musical
People.

Kinsley was involved with various projects
on behalt of the Negroes residing in New Bern,
N.C., after the Union forces had captured that
city. Letters from teachers and aid society
workers describe life in New Bern during its
occupation, skirmishes with vtonfederate troops,
and the efforts to educate and provide for the
free Negro. Kinsley took a particular interest
in Mrs. Mary Ann Starkey and her childern.

Mrs. Starkey's letters to her benefactor in-

 

 

 
Kinsley, Edward Wilkinson. fe)

clude comments on the activities of Kinsley's
brother who was an officer in the U.S. Army

and on the charitable work in New Bern. They
also illustrate some of the problems confronting
a Negro family during the war years.

Extracts from letters written by General
Edward Augustus Wild include discussions of the
situation in South Carolina and Georgia dur-
ing the first months after peace. A letter of
July 1, 1665, from J.M. Trotter describes con-
ditions around Orangeburg, S.C. Trotter also
notes the reagtion to him as a Negro in charge

 

 
Kinsley, Edward Wilkinson. 9
of enforcing peace and emancipation.

Kinsley served in his state's militia, but
he received a medical exemption from service in
the Army on Nov. ll, 1662. Veterans from his
state, however, recognized his contributions
to the war effort by naming an organization for
him, the Edward W. Kinsley Post 113, Grand Army
of the Republic. there are two letters concern
ing this group.

Several letters, especially two by William
Claflin, discuss political affairs in Massachu-
setts during the mid-1070's. Claflin and

 

 
Kinsley, Edward wilkinson 1O
Kinsley both apparently were opposed to the ra-
dical measures supported by Benjamin Franklin
Sutler. Numerous other topics are mentioned in
this collection, but they are not discussed
frequently or in much depth.

1 item added, 3-11-75. Kinsley wrote to his
wife on January 17, 1864, about his trip home
from North Carolina by way of Washington where
he planned to see Senator Sumner.

John Hendricks Kinyoun was born in Rowan
County, N. C. on Oct. 4, 1825. He was educated
at Jonesville Academy, Mocksville Academy, Wake
Forest College, Columbian College in Washington,

D. C., and Union College at Schenectady, N. Y.
He attended medical school at the University of
New York in the late 1850's. In 1856 he married
Elizabeth A. [Bonnie] (Conrad) of East Bend,

 
Kinyoun, John Hendricks 2
Yadkin Co., N. C. Enlisting in the Confederate
Army shortly after the beginning of the war,

he was commissioned captain of Company F, 28th

N. C. Volunteers on June 18, 1861. On April

12 of the following year he resigned this post

and in June was commissioned surgeon in the C,

S. A. Army. From Aug., 1862, to Jan. 1863,

he was assigned to Winder Hospital in Richmond,
Dissatisfied with hospital duty, he left Rich-

mond and joined the 66th N. C. Infantry as sur-
geon in 1863. Until May, 1864, he was with his

 

 
Kinyoun, John Hendricks 3
regiment in North Carolina, mostly around Wil-
mington. From July to Dec., 1864, he was in the
lines at Petersburg, but his regiment was or-
dered back to North Carolina to defend Fort
Fisher and remained in the state until the sur-
render. Shortly after the war Kinyoun and his
family moved from Enon, Yadkin Co., to Center-
view, Missouri, where he practiced medicine
until his death on July 27, 1903.

This collection consists largely of personal
correspondence of Kinyoun and his wife during

 

 
Kinyoun, John Hendricks 4
the war years and some family letters from the
Reconstruction period. There is some genealo-
gical material on the Kinyoun family, as well
as some printed material, legal papers, and
photographs of Kinyoun and his wife.

The letters begin in 1851 when Kinyoun was
a student at Columbian College in Washington,
D. C. In the first letter he describes attend-
ing a meeting of the American Colonization So-
ciety at which Henry Clay, Millard Fillmore, and

Richard Fuller were present. The war letters

 

 
Kinyoun, John Hendricks

from Kinyoun to his wife begin in Aug., 1861,
when his regiment, the 28th N. C. Volunteers,
was in Wilmington. Throughout the war Kinyoun
wrote generally about camp life, the health of
the troops, supplies, food, and military affairs
In a letter of Feb. 10, 1862, he talks about the
Battle of Roanoke Island. Following his resig-
nation from the regiment he became a surgeon

in the army; letters from Aug., 1862, to Jan.,
1863, concern his work in Winder Hospital in

Richmond. The letters for 1863 and early 1864

 

 
Kinyoun, John Hendricks 6
are written from various places in N. C. while
Kinyoun was with the 66th N. C. Infantry. In
May, 1864, the regiment was sent to Virginia,
and until December, Kinyoun worked in the infir-
mary of Maj. Gen. Robert F. Hoke's division at
Petersburg. While there are some references to
military activities in these letters, there is
almost no mention of Kinyoun's hospital service.
In Dec., 1864, the regiment returned to N. C.

to defend Fort Fisher. Kinyoun's letters give
some details about the retreat from Wilmington

 

 
 

Kinyoun, John Hendricks Z
after the fall of the fort. Until the end of
the war, Kinyoun believed devoutly in the South-
ern cause and in eventual Southern independence
and repeatedly criticized deserters, profiteers,
unionist sympathizers, and those who failed to
volunteer for Confederate service.

The letters for the years after 1865 are al-
most entirely personal and were written to the
Kinyouns after they moved to Centerview, Mo.
Mrs. Kinyoun died in 1872.

The folder of writings contains a political
