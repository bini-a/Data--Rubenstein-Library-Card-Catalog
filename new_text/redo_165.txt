J. R. Brown was a private in the Confederate
service [regiment not known.]. In these letters
he is most concerned with current rumors as to
the end of the war. He mentions desertions
to the Union forces, and the very limited

rations given out early in 1865.

Joseph Emerson Brown (1821-1894), was born
in Pickens county, S.C. When fifteen years old
he removed with his father to Georgia, and,
afterattending the Calhoun academy, S.C.,
taught school at “anton, Ga., studied law, and

was admitted to the bar in Aug., 1845. He was
graduated at the Yale law school in 1846, and
in 1852 he was chosen a presidential elector

on the Pierce ticket. He was elected governor
by the democrats in 1857, aid was re-elected

 
BROWN, Joseph. Emerson 2

ky increased majorities in 1859, 1861, and 1863.
He was an active secessionist, seizing Forté
Pulaski and Jackson,near Savannah, on Yan. 3,
1861, sixteen days before the state seceded,
and taking possession of the U.S. arsenal at
Augusta, five days after the passing of the
ordinance. During the war he was:a vigorous
supporter of the Confederate government, but
disputed with Pres. Davis the constitutional-
ity of the conscription measures. During Sher-
man's invasion he put into the field an army
of 10,000 men made up of ef those exempt from

 

 
BROWN, Joseph Emerson 3
military duty, but refused to send them out of
the state when the requisition was made by the
Confederate government. In Oct, 1864, he refused
Sherman's request for a conference, denying
that he was authorized to act without the per-
mission of the legislature. On his release

from prison at the close of the war, he re-

 

signed the governorship, and, after a visit to
Washington in 1866, strongly advised his state
to accept the situation and comply with the
terms of reconstruction. This position made
him unpopular, and for a time he acted with the

 
BROWN, Joseph Emerson ne 4
republicans, supporting Yrant in 1868, and be-
ing defeated as the republican candidate for
U.S. senator in the same year. After his de-
feat he was appointed chief justice of the
Georgia supreme court, which office he resign-
ed in Dec., 1870. After that time he was pres-
ident of the Western and Atlantic railroad.

 

In 1880 he was chosen U.S. senator to fill the
vacancy caused by the resignation of Gen. Gore
don. In 1884 he was re-elected,with but a

single ppposing vote, for the term ending in

One letter in the collection deals with
the disposal of the stores received from the
Augusta arsenal (May4, 1861), and the other
with the defeat of the enemy near Cedar Keys,
Fla. (March 9, 1865) The collection is small
but exceptionally vahuable.

 

One letter tfhansferred Sept. 1, 1944, from
the C. C. Jones books, concerns a commision

the Confederate Navy (letter dated Feb. 28,

Neill Brown was a Presbyterian of Scotch
stock living in Robeson Co., N. C., near Rich-
land Swamp. Two brothers, Hugh and Duncan,lived
in Tennessee as early as the 1820's. Duncan
Brown who was well educated and well read but un

 

duly pious lived in Maury Co., Tenn in 1820 as
well as earlier and in that year was 49 years
old, while Neill Brown of N. C. was somewhat ol-
der. Evidently Hugh Brown was also a minister.

minister in Gibson Co., Tenn. as early as 1844,
when he was a regular minister there. On June
26, 1844, Gillespie went to Jackson,Tenn. where
he established a Presbyterian church. Neill
Brown also had relatives in S. C. and Alabama.
The letters in this collection consequently
come from these three localities. *There is one
item which seems to be from a slave who could
write,to Neill Brown, reproaching him for turn-
ing his back to the blacks and preaching to the
whites. The collection especially reveals the
heavy westward migration from N.C.,and contains
useful comment on the early settlement of
Tennessee. S % WEGATWES AVAILAGLE

Wilmington, New Hanover Co., N. C.

 

Thomas W. Brown, Jr. was a captain of
Company A (German Volunteers), 18th Regiment,
N. C. Infantry (State Troops). He was
captured in the late spring of 1862 and spent
the summer of that year in the Union prisons

at Fort Columbus, Governor's Island, N. Y.,
and at Johnson's Island near Sandusky, Ohio.

This collection consists of Brown's letters
to his family during his imprisonment. Since
his mail, both incoming and outgoing, was

 
Brown, Thomas W., Jr. 2
censored, Brown was forced to limit both the
length and content of his letters. He states
that his treatment by Union men and the
conditions at the two prisons were quite mild
and humane. This praise for his Union captors
appears to be genuine and not the result of the
pressures and inhibitions placed upon him by
censorship.

Brown felt that his transfer from Fort
Columbus to Johnson's Island would quickly
result in his release through prisoner-of-war
exchanges. On Aug. 31, 1862, he wrote his

 

 
Brown, Thomas W., Jr. 3
Sister that he was traveling south by way of
Vicksburg and the Mississippi River; presumably,
this journey was occasioned by the exchange of
prisoners that he had mentioned previously.

Brown, William. Ledger B, 1776-1791. Bath,
Beaufort County, North Carolina

 

This account book was used by several
people between the 1760's and 1840's, and many
pages are missing. The first part of the
volume is a ledger in which accounts were
kept for a tavern, ferriage, and port charges

from 1776 to 1791 at Bath, North Carolina.
The later records are agricultural accounts
of farmers, the Smaws, near the town of

Washington.

 
Brown, William “2

 

The location of the tavern has been
determined from internal evidence. The names
of the customers identify the ledger with
Beaufort County. The age of the records
suggests that Washington was not the site of
the business, for that town was only then
beginning. Further, the tavern was older than

the volume that is Ledger B in which accounts
were continued from Ledger A. Identification
of the tavern with Bath is provided by some

of the numerous entries for ferriage, some of

 
Brown, William

 

which include passage to and from Durham
Creek; the mouth of this creek lies across
the Pamlico River from Bath (ff. 36, 41, 44,
are examples). Entries for ferriage over
both Durham and Bath creeks appear on f. 67
along with expenses for going to court at
Washington.

The identification of the owner or owners
of the tavern is difficult, but some evidence
indicates that William Brown was a proprietor.
The accounts (ff. 20, 42) of two customers

 
Brown, William 4

 

were marked as settled by William Brown. The
Colonial Records of North Carolina identify
Brown as a state legislator from the town of
Bath, who was a member of the historic
Provincial Congress at Halifax in 1776 (X, 501).
In the same year he was appointed the
commissioner for the port of Bath (X, 707).

 

In February, 1776, Alderson Ellison, the county
sheriff, presented a statement of expenditures

that included a payment of over #23 to William

Brown for ferriage (X, 460).

 
Brown, William eA

 

The John Simpson Collection at the North
Carolina State Department of Archives and
History includes a letter of Jan. 20, 1781,
written by William Brown of Bath. The signature
on this letter matches the two signatures on
folios 20 and 42. A Xerox copy of this letter
is filed with the ledger.

(Continued on the next card)

 
Brown, William 5
The tavern accounts are especially numerous
for 1776 and the early 1780's. They include a
number of prominent citizens, including Thomas
Respess, Sr., and Thomas Respess, Jr., who
were at the Halifax Congress. The term
"dinner and club" appears often in the entries,
but it apparently does not refer to a social
organization. The term "club" was also used
at the time to mean beverages; see Craigie and

Brown, William Garrott. Papers, 1891-1927.
Marion, Ala., and gembridge, Mass.

Brown (1868-1913 » & native of Marion Ala.,
was a promising young historian and essayist.
Just as he was attaining a place of prominence
his health failed and tuberrculosis made him

an invalid. Thereafter he spent most of his
time in western N. C. and from his bed wrote

 

 

much on current affairs, thereby supporting
himself financially. His best known work is
The Lower South in American History.

These papers are personal and professional
correspondence and literary notes. They relate

 

 
Brown, William Garrott 2
to many phases of his life and work.

See the Guide for a more detailed sketch of
the papers.

79 items added, 7-1-67: In preparing a
dissertation on William Garrott Brown in 1962,
Bruce Clayton secured a number of copies of
Brown's letters. Three folders of this

 

material are placed at the end of the William
Garrott Brown Papers.

The first group of letters comes from
Alabama.

The second group contains a series of

 
Brown, William Garrott 4
photostats from the papers of President

Charles William Eliot in the Harvard University
Library. Brown, who evidently had high regard
for Eliot, wrote in 1892-1902 on various mat-
ters of official business, inchuding the con-
ditons of his employment at Harvard, Harvard
students in the Spanish-American War, the

 

Harvard Guide book, and University portraits.
In 1908-1909 Brown was concerned in having
Eliot speak at Asheville while on a Southern
tour. He analyzed on dan. 10, 1909, the feel-
ing of the South towards Harvard University

 
Brown, William Garrott
and Massachusetts and continued on Jan. 26
and Feb. 2, 1909, to review the race problem.
The third folder contains Xerox copies of
Brown letters in the Edward Mandell House
Papers in Yale University Library. From 1911
till 1913 Brown was deeply interested in the
issues, politics, and personalities of the

 

Wilson Campaign for the Presidency. He had
been and was writinzgg political editorials

for Harper's Weekly, so that his remarks in
correspondence to Edward House based on study
and long experience are penetrating and infor-

mative. =

reports are about his travels in the South from
March through June, 1904. The states on which
he reports are Alabama, Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, Virginia, and Tex-
as. The principal subjects covered are commer-
cial and industrial developments, Negroes, labor

relations, education, race relations, and chang-
ing attitudes in the South. The cities to which
he gives particular attention are Durham, Bir-
mingham, and New Orleans. In writing about
Durham he also covered the "Bassett Affair" at

The name of Brown & Ives is illustrious in
the annals of American mercantile history. It
is noted in the biographical sketches of Nicho-
las Brown (1729-1791) and of Nicholas Brown
(1769-1841) in the Dictionary of American

Biography.

 

A letter of Feb. 11, 1803, was addressed
from Brown & Ives to Messrs. D. & I. (or J.)
Moses of Boston. It concerned the value and
sale of land scrip of Georgia and Mississippi

 
Brown & Ives

some of which the firm was willing to sell,
possibly to purchasers in the New England
Mississippi Company.

The manuscript is slightly confusing, because
the letter is Brown & Ives's copy which they
made on a blank page (with address on the other
side) of a letter that the Moses firm had sent
to them,

written. The correspondence consists of the
personal letters of the Brown brothers to their
families and contain principally expressions of

 

affection and loneliness. The brothers appear
to be somewhat pessimistic about the fulfillment
of their desire to see their families again.
They complain about the lack of food and cloth-

their services.

In a letter dated Aug. 14, 1862, Austin Brown
wrote that "Stonewall" Jackson's strategy in
battle seemed to call for a quick retreat after
holding the battlefield for a time sufficiently
long to diminish whatever force the attacking
forces might have.

Browne, Thomas (d. 1780). Papers. London,
England.

 

Thomas Browne (17087-1780), British heral-
dic official, became Bluemantle Pursuivant in
1737, Lancaster Herald in 1743, Norroy King-of-
Arms in 1761, Clarenceux in 1773, and Garter
King-of-Arms in 1774. He is referred to in the

Dictionary of National Biography as "a most
eminent land surveyor."

He was presumably the author of a survey of
estates (67 ff.) entitled "A Particular and
Valuation of the several Estates of the late
John Bouverie. Esq. “6 Countys of Kent,

 

 
Browne, Thomas
Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, Berkshire, Yorkshire,
The Citys of London and Westminster, with the
Valuation of the Timber and Woods upon the said
Estates taken by Thomas Browne by order of John
Harvey Esq. and his Lady, and Miss Bouverie,
1751." The total value of the estates exceeded
A80,000, and the clear annual rent reached
43,285. The survey is a handsome and meticulous
analysis of the estates--one worthy of so noted
a surveyor,

The survey includes detailed descriptions of
all land, buildings, timber, and other features

Browne, Thomas i

 

of each farm, town house and shop. The names
and rental status of the tenants is given.
Browne's opinions of each property sometimes
contain observations on economic conditions.

The estates are: Chart and Maidstone in Kent
(ff. 1-21); East Betchworth, Surrey (ff. 24-35),
including a description of each room of the fine
seventeenth-century manor-house that was later
owned by Henry Goulburn; Warnford, Hampshire
(ff. 37-44), leased to Lord Clanricarde;

Feldams and Redstone farms in Berkshire (ff. 46-
48); and residences, shops, and warehouses in

 
Browne, Thomas 4

 

London at Lothbury Estate and Great Queen and
Great Wild streets (ff. 50-62); and Barnsley,
Yorkshire (ff. 65).

A history of the manor of East Betchworth
and its ownership by the Bouveries is in The
Victoria History of the County of Surrey, III,
167-168. John Bouverie, second son of Sir

 

Christopher Bouverie, inherited the estate in
1734. He died in 1750 while traveling in
Turkey, and his sisters, Anne, wife of John
Hervey, and Elizabeth Bouverie, inherited the
property. Sir Christopher Bouverie was the

 
Browne, Thomas ie

 

brother of Sir William Bouverie (or Des Bou-
verie), First Baronet, who was the grandfather
of the First Earl of Radnor. This relationship
is shown in Burke's Extinct and Dormant Baronet-
cies of England (London, 1838), p. 76. The
family name was legally established as Bouverie.
John Hervey (1696-1764) of East Betchworth was

 

M.P. for Reigate, 1739-1741, and Wallingford,
1754-1764. His marriage to Anne Bouverie and
his career are reported in Sir Lewis Namier and
John Brooke, The House of Commons, 1754-1790
(New York, 1964), II, 619-620. Members of both

 

 
Browne, Thomas 6

 

the Bouverie and Hervey families were Turkey
merchants. Sir Christopher Bouverie was men-
tioned in Browne's description of the house at

Chart (f. 1).
John Bouverie's daughter Elizabeth (d. 1798)

was a friend of Hannah More (see the index to
the William Wilberforce Papers).

Amos G. Browning was a physician in Maysville
Ky. He received his medical education at
Georgetown College in Washington, D. C. He also
worked as a clerk in Congress and as a private
secretary to several U. S. Senators. When the

Civil War began, he resigned his position in the
Auditor's Office of the Treasury Department and
left Washington. It appears that he moved to
Ohio and then to Kentucky to begin his medical

practice,

 
Browning, Amos G, 2

 

Browning collected newspaper clippings and
mounted many of them in a scrapbook which he
asked to be preserved as a record of the early
years of the Civil War. The majority of these
clippings are dated July and August, 1861, and
many of them contain accounts of the First Bat-
tle of Bull Run (Manassas) and its results.

The articles are from both Union and Confederate
papers and therefore present a balanced inter-
pretation of the battle. Numerous articles

were clipped from Democratic papers in Ohio,
Kentucky, and Missouri. These articles are

 
Browning, Amos G, .

 

quite critical of Lincoln and his administra-
tion. Browning's own writings and his regard
for John Cabell Breckenridge, Stephen Arnold
Douglas, and Clement Laird Vallandingham indi-
cate that he too probably was opposed to the
policies of the Republican administration.
Among the unbound clippings are several arti-
cles written by Browning. Their subjects in-
clude the shooting of Philip Barton Key by
Daniel Edgar Sickles, Clara Barton, the New
Harmony community in Indiana, and life in
Washington during the first few months of the

Civil War. =

These young men wrote to their mother and their

were in bitter fighting in Virginia. Levi

on a cavalry scout, and Samuel P. Lockhart was

 

killed on Aug. 21, 1864, at the fight at Globe

as the last man left to help his widowed mother.
However, he, too, was in the trenches at
Petersburg by June, 1864, in the 2nd N. C.
Cavalry.

The history of the Nineteenth N. C. Cavalry
Regiment was written by the Captain of Co. K,
William A. Graham of Hillsborough, for Walter
Clark, North Carolina Regiments, 1861-1865,

duty of this cavalry group was during the

 

 

 
Browning, Hugh Conway 5
winter of 1862 when they served as cavalry
outposts in the Neuse River Valley against the
Union Army. After the fall of New Bern the
Lockharts were based at or near Kinston, from
where they sent many letters home.

The letters of this family group give an
excellent view of North Carolina people during

 

the Civil War. The pictures of Captain John P.
Lockhart and Sergenat Levi Y. Lockhart are
with William A. Graham's narrative of the 19th

Cavalry.

John Holden, Jr. (1808-1878), who went to
Tennessee in 1833. The parentage and activities
of Governor William Woods Holden are discussed
in this correspondence, A number of copies of

William Gannaway Brownlow (Aug. 29, 1805-April
29,1877) began his career in 1829 in East Tenn,
as a Methodist minister but soon turned to po-
litigal journalism which furnished a more fruit-
ful field for the Parson's talents. His con-

nections were seldom severed throughout the re-
mainder of his life with newspaper work in East
Tenn. Brownlow fought secession and remained
true to the Union by joining the Republican
Party. He served as Reconstruction governor of
Tennessee from March i to Feb, 10, 1869

Fourteenth Amendment, which was introduced into
Congress in June, 1866.

problems such as speculation, high prices,

debt and taxation. Governor Brown also wrote
on his attitude towards Confederate conscription
and the raising of Georgia State Troops, as
well as the provisioning of Georgia troops and

aid to soldiers’ families.

Reports, 1888-1894. Brunswick, Glynn County,
Georgia.

 

The Brunswick and Western Railroad Company
was formed in 1888 from the Brunswick and
Albany Railroad that was sold and reorganized
in that year. The headquarters of the company

was at Brunswick, Georgia, from which city

the line ran westward. through Waycross and
Tifton to Albany, Georgia. In 1901 this
company was absorbed by the Savannah, Florida,

and Western Railroad. This line was itself

 
Brunswick and Western Railroad Company 2
acquired in 1902 by the Atlantic Coast Line
Railroad and has remained a part of it since
that year.

This collection consists of 135 volumes of
the financial reports of the Brunswick and
Western for the period from January 1, 1888,
to June 30, 1894. These reports show the
earnings of the company and the subsidiary
accounts and data that are used in determining
them. Th@ asset, liability, and capital
accounts are not included. These records

are divided into annual, semiannual, quarterly,

 

 
Brunswick and Western Railroad Company 7
and monthly reports, and they are filed accord-
ing to these categories.

The annual reports(6 volumes) are incomplete
There are volumes for 1888, 1890, and for the
years ending June 30, 1893 and June 30, 1894.
The reports for 1889 and 1893, however, contain
comparative figures that include 1888 and 1892,
respectively.

The semiannual reports(16 volumes) are
consecutive for the period from January l,
1888, through June 30, 1894.

The quarterly reports(34 volumes) are

 

 
Brunswick and Western Railroad Company 4
consecutive for 1855-1891, 1893, and the first
half of 1894. For 1892 thereports represent
only the first and fourth quarters of the
year.

The monthly reports(79 volumes) are con-
secutive from January, 1888, through June,
1894, except for the report for April, 1892.

There are two or more volumes for a number
of the reports. Frequently the additional
copies are those that were signed by the
auditor.

addition of the James West Bryan family corres-
pondence, Involved with the Bryan family are
the Weshingtons of Kinston, N.C., the Shepards
of Beaufort and New Bern, and the Donnells of
New Bern and Raleigh.

James West Bryan and John Herritage Bryan
were brothers, so that the members of their
family continue their correspondence after the
Civil War. See table at beginning of papers,

 

 
Bryan Family, Papers 2

 

John Herritage Bryan, son of James Bryan
(d. 1806) and Rachel Herritage Bryan, was born
in New Bern, North Carolina, on November 4,1798
and died in Raleigh on May 19, 1870. He
attenced New Bern Academy and in 1815 was gradu
ated from the University of North Carolina.
He was admitted to the bar in 1819 and in 1823
and 1824 served in the state senate. He was
elected as—e-Weie to the nineteenth and the
twentieth Congresses (1825-1829). Declining

 
Bryan. Fainily, Papers 3
to become a candidate again, he returned to
New Bern where he resumed his law practice.
In 1839 he moved to Raleigh and continued to
practice law. In 1821 he married Mary W.
Shepard. He served as a trustee of the Uni-
versity of North Carolina from 1823-1868.
This collection may be divided into three

 

general categories:(l)correspondence; (2) legal
papers; and (3) miscéllaneous items, consis-
ting of speeches, documents, bills and receipts
and numerous writings of Henry Ravenscroft
Bryan, son of John Herritage Bryan.

 
Bryan, Family Papers os 4
There are a number of letters to John

Herritage Bryan from his brother James West
Bryan. Although these letters are largely
concerned with family or routine business or
legal matters, some do contain brief comments
on politics. In a letter from New Bern, dated
February 26, 1826, James W. Bryan remarks that
a recent speech delivered by John H. Bryan in
Washington had been published in the Sentinel
and had made a good impression on the people.
Having just returned from Wayne County, James
Bryan believed that the Quaker interest, which

 

 
Bryan Family..Papers 3

 

was predominant there, was in John’s favor.
Other letters, 1826-1829, deal with John's
political standing in the state, especially
since he was not a wholehearted supporter of
Andrew Jackson, who James Bryan felt, had
“prostrated decency."

There are several letters from William

Biddle Shepard, National Republican member
from North Carolina of the 21st, 22nd, 23rd,
and 24th Congresses (March 4, 1829-March 3,
1837). Ina letter dated September 28, 1826,
Shepard informs John H. Bryan that the Fair-

 
Bryan, Family. Papers _6
field district is unanimous in favor of Jackson.
One of the most interesting letters in the
collection is that written by William B. She-
pard from Washington on January 27, 1830, about
the Webster - Hayne Debate.

In 1850 several county conventions had nom-
inated Shepard as the Whig candidate for gover-
nor; Shepard, however, did not really want
the nomination and understood that Charles
Manly was anxious to secure it. He asked
Bryan's advice.

William Alexander Graham, a leading North

 

 
Bryan. Family Papers 7
Carolina Whig and Secretary of the Navy under
Millard Fillmore, wrote to John Herritage
Bryan from Washington on ‘June 18, 1851. Gra-
ham commented on the President's recent trip
to Lake Erie and spoke in high praise of him.
Graham went on to speak of the attitude of
the abolitionists toward the administration

 

and urged Southerners to support the com-
promise measures of the administration. He
said some Southerners were far worse enemies
of slavery than the abolitionists will ever be.
There are a number of other letters of con-

 
 

Bryan Family Papers 8
siderable interest. On December 15, 1525,

Otway Burns, the famous seaman of the War of
1812 and now a state legislator, wrote to

John Herritage Bryan from Raleigh, criticizing
the past legislative session. David Lowry
Swain, President of the University of North
Carolina, wrote to John H. Bryan on May 5,

1851, stating that Charles, apparently Bryan's
son, had been derelict in attending morning
prayers; he was in danger of being sent home.
In a letter of July 10, 1855, John H. Bryan
declined an invitation to address an American

 
Bryan. Family Papers _ 9.
Party meeting in Raleigh. He nevertheless
expresses his agreement with many of the party's
principles. On February 16, 1856, Francis
Lister Hawks, a native of North Carolina and
@ prominent Episcopal clergyman, wrote John
Herritage Bryan that he wanted to leave New
York which was no longer a fit place for a

 

Southerner. A letter dated June 21, 1904,

addressed to William Howard Taft, Secretary of
War, requests that the extreme western channel
of the Neuse River near New Bern be opened for

navigation.

 
Bryan Family Papers 10
There are in the collection many letters
written by or addressed to Henry Ravenscroft
Bryan, son of John H. Bryan. Most of these
letters are concerned with family or routine
legal or business matters; however, some con-
tain information on post-Civil War politics
in North Carolina. Ina letter to his brother,
William Shepard Bryan, dated May 23, 1866,
Henry Ravenscroft Bryan spoke of the great
depression among the people caused by recent
Congressional action and the great scarcity

of money. In another letter to William Shepard

 

 
Bryan Family Papers | 11
Bryan, dated June 15, 1867, he spoke of the
great despondency in New Bern and the "terrible
despotism" of the military government. He
feared many people would leave North Carolina;
he himself was considering seeking refuge in
Baltimore. The newspapers were afraid to
expose the"rascality" of the military. Gen.

 

Daniel E. Sickles, the military commander of
North and South Carolina, seemed to be worse
than the other "Tycoons" in the South. A

copy of an undated letter (ca. 1900), apparent-

ly sent to the registrars of all precincts in

 
Bryan, Family Papers 12
Craven County, stresses the importance of
getting all white people registered at once;
those registering under the "grandfather
clause" are to be registered on the general
registration book. Henry R. Bryan was chair-
man of the Craven County Democratic Executive
Committee.

 

Two interesting letters, dated April 23,
1873 and October 20, 1873, are addressed to
Henry 8. Bryan from his brother,J. H. Bryan,
who had apparently settled in Petropolis,

Brazil. The letter of October 20, 1873, spoke

 
Bryan, Family Papers. 13
of the high prices in Brazil and expressed fear
that the gradual abolition of slavery would
mean the destruction of the country, since
Brazilians were so lazy. Bryan also spoke
about the churches and schocls of Brazil.

Among the legal papers are a number of land
grants, the oldest being dated September 26,
1735. This grant was to. William Wilson for
three hundred acres in Craven’ County. A
number of papers deal with the sale of lands in
Craven County and Wake County and with the

purchase and sale of slaves. A deed dated

 

 
Bryan. Family Papers 14
August 1, 1837, transfers title of two lots

in Raleigh to John Herritaze Bryan from George
Edmund Badger. The will of Elizabeth Hatch,
dated March 28, 1847, mentions James W. and
John H. Bryan. The pardons granted by Andrew
Johnson to John Herritage Bryan and Henry R.
Bryan are in the collection. There are several
contracts signed by Henry RB. Bryan with men
who were apparently former slaves concerning
share-cropping on Bryan's plantation, "Clere
mont." A few papers relate to the Atlantic
and North Carolina Railroad, in which Henry R.

 

 
Bryan. Family Papers 15
Bryan was a stockholder.

Among the miscellaneous items is a paper
dated October 4, 1855, which describes a field
trip under the direction of Dr. Elisha Mitchell
(1793-1857), Professor of Chemistry, Geology,
and Mineralogy at the University of North Caro-
lina, 1825-1857. There are also two copies
of a sketch of the life of John H. Bryan,
written by his son, William S. Bryan.

Several interesting items of printed mat-
ter are found in the collection. There are
four pages from The Signal (Washington, D. C.,

 

 

 
Bryan, Family Papers 16
July TU, 153) Sealing with the Whig nomination
of Winfield Scott for President and William
Alexander Graham of North Carolina for Vice-
President. There is a small pamphlet entitled
epness ion of the People which urges the
election of Samuel J. Tilden. A clipping from
an unidentified newspaper contains a letter

written by John Thomas Deweese, a Radical
member of Congress from North Carolina in 1867
who subsequently turned Democrat; Deweese
denounced the Republican rule in North Carolina
and charged Governor William W. Holden, Gen.

Joseph Carter Abbott and others with fraud

and corruption. There are several clippings
reporting the death of John H. Bryan and one
reporting the death of his wife, Mary W. Bryan,
in 1881. A clipping from the New York Herald,
April 29, 1888, deals with the plight of the
Negro inhabitants in James City, across the

Bryan Family Papers 18
2496 items and 36 volumes added, 1-12-68, to
the Bryan Family Papers are concerned chiefly
with the family of James West Bryan (1805-1864)
and his son, James Augustus Bryan (1839-1923).
After the death of James Bryan (1769-1806),
his young sons, John Herritage Bryan (1798-1870
and James West Bryan (1805-1864), together with
their mother, Rachel (Herritage) Bryan, formed
a close unit, sharing their financial problems,
The marriage of John Herritage Bryan brought
the Shepards of Beaufort and New Bern into the
group. James West Bryan married into the

 

 
Bryan Family Papers 19
Washington family of Kinston. His son, James
Augustus Bryan, married into the Donnell-
Spaight-Shepard family. Thus the Bryan Family
Papers contain references to all these. prom-
inent names in the Neuse River Valley.

The correspondence opens with letters of
Richard Dobbs Spaight II to John Herritage Brya

 

who was studying law at Grove Hill, Warren Co.,
N.C., in 1817-1818. These letters give a
glimpse of the busy social life of New Bern and
the growth of this section with the opening of
steamboat connections with Norfolk.

 
Bryan Family Papers 20

While John Herritage Bryan served in the. Con
gress of the United States (1825-1829), James
West Bryan sent reports to Washington on local
politics in North Carolina and on family
business. Evidently at this time the Bryans
were founding their legal practice and the
family fortune.

 

From 1828 until 1837 the Bryan papers
describe in considerable detail the working of
the state government of North Carolina. The
Bryans were Whigs, and so reflect the view of
that party in the struggle with the followers

 
Bryan Family Papers 21

of Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren. Many
prominent politicians of North Carolina are
mentioned, among whom are William Gaston,
Richard Dobbs Spaight, John Branch, William
Biddle Shepard, David L. Swain, Henry Seawell,
David Outlaw, Nathaniel Macon, Joseph Gales,
Joseph J. Daniel, Hugh Lawson White, Romulus
M. Saunders, William Henry Haywood, William
Norwood, Paul C. Cameron, John M. Dick, Weldon
N. Edwards, William B. Meares, and Willie
Person Mangum. Evidently the election of
numerous state officials, including the

 

 
Bryan Family Papers 22
Governor, by the General Assembly caused a great
deal of political uproar.

The Reform Convention of 1835 ended this
commotion in the Assembly. James West Bryan
was a member and became a state senator from
Carteret Co., 1835-1836. Evidently he owned a
home in Beaufort, N.C..On June 4, 1835, he
described the difficulty of organizing the
Reform Convention. Nathaniel Macon was elected
its president. The troublesome, long-winded
sessions were controlled by the Whigs.

Theodore Frelinghuysenof New Jersey having

 

 
Bryan Family Papers 23
declined the presidency of the University of
North Carolina, the question of a new president
was debated (June 22, 1835).

In this convention the rivalry between the
East and the West in North Carolina politics
was noted. On June 25, 1835, James West Bryan
wrote of the disfranchisement of boroughs and
the election of the members of the General
Assembly to bienniel sessions.

Back again in Raleigh on Nov. 19, 1835, Brya
described the organization of the new General
Assembly. He was chairman of the Judiciary

 

 
Bryan Family Papers 24
Committee, and as such commented on the naming
of the judges of the Supreme Court of North
Carolina,

On Dec. 17, 1835, he notes that the resolu-
tions of Carteret Co. to deepen Core Sound have
passed the Senate,

In May, 1836, James West Bryan went to New

 

York to engage in business and legal practice,
He stopped in Washington where he met Willie
Person Mangum, Ebenezer Pettigrew, Hugh Lawson
White, and William Biddle Shepard. He writes
of office-seeking and the party “wigwam." The

 
Bryan Family Papers 25
contrast between lively Washington and quiet
New Bern is noted; improvement in the north is
exemplified by the new one-day trip by railroad
from Washington to New York. He sends news of
the conduct of General Santa Anna in Mexico.
Family news in the summer of 1836 includes
comment on the health of Rachel (Herritage)

 

Bryan, the presence of Charles and Mary (Donnell
Shepard in New York, and the annual visit of
North Carolinians to Newport, R.I., and
Saratoga, N.Y. The Bryan family visited Beau-
fort in Aug., 1836, but James West Bryan

 
Bryan Family Papers 26
returned to New York. He wrote of purchasing
supplies there for John H. Bryan and commented
that many Southerners placed large orders for
merchandise in order to make substantial
Savings. At this time a plan was underway to
incorporate a town at Shepard's Point in
Beaufort, N.C.

 

James West Bryan was still in business in New
York in 1837, when he was undecided about
leaving his legal practice for business, He was
staying with Dr. James Augustus Washington
(1803-1847), a prominent physician who was the

 
Bryan Family Papers 27
brother of Bryan's wife Ann Mary (Washington)
Bryan. A great cessation of business in New
York resulted in unemployment for thousands
of clerks, North Carolina banks had not sus-
pended specie payments, as had many Northern
banks,

In July, 1837, the family of Charles Biddle
Shepard was again in New York,

James West Bryan reported an interview in
July, 1837, with Silas Price Carson, Secretary
of State in Texas, who was commissioner to
Washington to secure aid for Texan independence

 

 
Bryan Family Papers , 2e
James West Bryan continued his business in
New York, but failed during the panic of the
late 1830's, so that he had to sell his Negroes
to settle his indebtedness (See legal papers).
His son, James Augustus Bryan (1839-1923)
was sent to McNally's School and Loyola College
in Baltimore before going to Princeton Univer-

 

sity in 1860. During the Civil War he was an
artillerist and ordnance officer, serving on
the staffs of Generals Lawrence O'Bryan Branch

and James A. Lane,
Two sets of letters were written just before

 
Bryan Family Papers 29
and during the Civil War period. One series
is from the involvement in 1863 of Captain
James A. Bryan in a misunderstanding about the
collection of maney for a monument in Raleigh tq
General Lawrence O'Bryan Branch. [Included in
this controversy were George Burgwyn, Will M.
Barbour, and Adolphus Engelhard,

The second series centered in the Donnell
group, a member of which was Mary Spaight
Shepard. Her father, Charles Biddle Shepard
(d. 1847), married Mary Spaight Donnell. The

 

 
Bryan Family Papers 30

 

Charles Shepards and the James West Bryans were
friends of long-standing. Mrs. Charles

Shepard lived in Philadelphia in the 1850's,
but returned to New Bern when the Civil war
began. With the Union occupation in 1862,

she and her father, Judge John Robert Donnell,
came to Raleigh. The marriage of Mary

Spaight Shepard and James Augustus Bryan in
November, 1864, in Raleigh united two large
and prominent groups.

The Donnell family was as successful in

 
Bryan Family Papers 31

 

business as in law and politics, Judge John
Robert Donnell, through his brother Willian,
held large investments in New Orleans, as did
his daughter, Mary (Donnell) Shepard. He
wrote letters of advice to her in the 1850's.
(See also bills and receipts of the Donnell
family in this collection. )

From 1862 until 1864 Judge Donnell received
reports from his overseer, Henry Jones, about
affairs on his plantation on Lake Confort,

Hyde County, N. C. Much comment was made about

 
Bryan Family Papers 32

 

crops, the conduct of the "black people,*
depredations by Union soldiers, and finally
the destructive Union raid on the Donnell
plantation in December, 1863. A few letters
in 1864 commented on lawbreakers, among whom
were the Juniper Bay Buffaloes. Judge Donnell
died at the end of 1864.

The letters of 1863-1865 reveal that a
number of Confederate citizens from the New
Bern area were refugees in the Neuse River
Valley from the Union occupation of the coast.

 
Bryan Family Papers 33

 

Laura Washington (Bryan) Hughes and her
husband, Dr. James Hughes of New Bern, were
at Kinston. The Shepards, Donnells, and
Bryans were living in Raleigh.

Meanwhile, James West Bryan and his wife
were in New York City in April, 1864, awaiting
a passport to enable them to return to New
Bern. Finally permitted to come South in the
summer, they died of yellow fever in New
Bern in October, 1864.

Mary (Shepard) and James Augustus Bryan

 
Bryan Family Papers 34

 

began a series of letters after their marriage
in November, 1864. Captain Bryan returned to
the army in Virginia, unable to secure a
furlough to settle the estate of his father.

A sharp dispute arose with Laura (Bryan)
Hughes over family possessions which were in
storage at Kinston. Mrs. Mary (Shepard) Bryan

gave details of refugee life in Raleigh during
the last months of the war,

Meanwhile Judge Donnell's estate was being
settled. Involved in New Orleans investments,

 
 

Bryan Family Papers 35
the estate was Finally extricated by Robert

Maitland of New York.

At the conclusion of the war James Augustus
Bryan bought at auction for ca. $3,000 his
father's furnishings (see financial papers).
Almost immediately he invested in a lumber
business in Craven County with John H.

Richardson, thus founding the Tuscarora Steam
and Grist Mills. Correspondence of this
company involved New York and Baltimore
business firms. The partnership was dissolved

 
Bryan Family Papers 36

 

in 1567, with James A. Bryan assuming control.
He planned a new mill in 1873, details of which
are discussed in letters of H. T. Guion of
Scuppernong, N. C., and Poole and Hunt Union
Works of Baltimore, Md. Bryan entered the
banking business ca. 1873. He eventually
became president of the First National Bank
of New Bern.

The legal papers of this addition, 1-12-68,
are chiefly deeds and indentures, 1717-1876,
for land along the Neuse and Trent rivers in

 
Bryan Family Papers 37

 

Craven county. They record the names of such
early settlers as Adam Moore, Moses Fogg,
Joseph Mason, John Gatlin, William Perden,
Colonel Edward Griffith, and Joseph Leech. The
latter sold land to Richard Dobbs Spaight in the
179-0's. Spaight also bought land belonging to
Francis Hawks. In time some of this property
came to the Donnells and the Shepards,

After the death of Judge John Robert Donnell
in 1864, his executor, Bartholomew Figures

Moore (1801-1878), gave a legal opinion in
which he summarized the career and holdings of

The financial papers in this addition are
those of James Augustus Bryan and his mother-
in-law, Mrs. Mary (Donnell) Shepard. From New

Bern came household and business receipts
showing supplies purchased from many New Bern

merchants. In this section of the manuscripts
are many shipping papers for lumber, accounts
of lumber sales, and other receipts for the
Tuscarora and the Lake Mills. Shipments of
freight are noted on the Atlantic and North

 
Bryan Family Papers 39
Carolina R.R., the line from Goldsboro to
Beaufort. James Augustus Bryan was appointed
— of this state-owned railway in 1899-
1904,

The Donnell family financial papers begin in
1855 with bills and receipts from the plantatia
in Hyde County. With the deaths of Judge
Donnell and his wife, Margaret (Spaight) Donne
long financial statements begin.

Mrs. Mary (Donnell) Shepard re-established
her home in the North in 1868, when her mother
died. The bills and receipts for the furnishing

 

 
Bryan Family Papers 40
and repair of the home in Englewood, N.J.,
involve many New York businesses, with lists of
prices of furniture, silver, china, and food.
Mrs. Shepard left her financial affairs in the
hands of Robert Maitland and Company of New
York,

The printed materials include a Civil War
broadside from Raleigh and many clippings .
James Augustus Bryan stated that he helped to
restore democratic government to Craven County
after the Civil War. (See the sketch in the
Van Noppen Papers.) Many of the clippings in

 

 
Bryan Family Papers 41
this addition pertain to reconstruction politics
1872-1874, on the national and local levels.
Comment is made on President Ulysses S. Grant,
Charles Sumner, Lyman Trumbull, and B. Gratz
Brown in the election of 1872. Negroes, civil
rights, Senators Benjamin Franklin Butler and
John Alexander Logan, the Force Bill and the

 

suspension of habeas corpus, local reconstruc-
tion in North Carolina, and the activities of
George W. Swepson and James H. Harris are dis-

cussed in the clippings.
The volumes added, 1-12-68, are chiefly

 

 
Bryan Family Papers 42
business accounts and bank books of James
Augustus Bryan for the Tuscarora Mills and the
Lake Mills, 1865-1875.

James A. Bryan married Julia Olmsted of
Princeton, N.J. in 1893. Mrs. Bryan was related
to the Field and Stockton families of N.J. Her
mother, Hannah Boudinot Field, was the niece of
Mrs. Benjamin Rush and the granddaughter of
Richard Stockton (1730-1781), the signer of the
Declaration of Independence. Her cousin was
Captain Robert Field Stockton (1795-1866) of the
United States Navy. James Augustus Bryan had

 

 
Bryan Family Papers __ 43
first married Mary Spaight Shepard whose mother
lived in Englewood, N.J., after the Civil War.
He himself had graduated from Princeton
University in 1860. Thus he probably had known
the Olmsted family of Princeton, N.J., for some
years when he married a second time in 1893.
Julia (Olmsted) Bryan is represented in these

 

papers by a diary of her father, George T.
Olmsted, and a recipe book of the Stockton-
Field family group.

George T. Olmsted (Feb. 15, 1804-187_) began
this diary on Feb. 15, 1834. A previous volume

 
Bryan Family Papers 44
is missing. He was a young engineer and sur-
veyor working on the Delaware and Raritan Canal
who was appointed in 1831 supervisor of the
construction of the middle section of this
canal, while Edward A. Douglas was in charge of
the western section.

On April 22, 1834, Olmsted married Hannah

 

Boudinot Field, daughter of Abigail (Stockton)
and Robert Field of Princeton, N.J. George
Olmsted had family ties in New York City. His
grandfather had been connected with the Brookl
Salt works, and he writes in his diary of H.

 
Bryan Family Papers 45
Olmsted of New York and a brother Charles in
Philadelphia.

When George Olmsted kept his diary, he, his
wife, and his son Robert (b. Apr. 13, 1835),
were living in Princeton, N.J., with Mrs. Field,
his mother-in-law. He was an educated man who
refers to books he is reading and to plays he
attends in New York. The social life in Prince
ton among the Stockton-Field group is active;
tea parties, sleigh rides, and a christening
party are noted. George Olmsted refers many
times to the activities of "Captain S," who was

 

 
Bryan Family Papers 46

 

Robert Field Stockton, and Richard Stockton
Field and their families. Many names recur in
the diary, both in business and in social
affairs. Among these people are Judge Martin
Ryerson, John Potter, Joseph E. Edsall, Asa C.
Dunham, David Bates Douglass, John Renshaw Thom
pson, Julia (Stockton) Rush, Professor Albert

Baldwin Dod, and Drs. Jos@ph and Isaac Parrish,
Events of particular interest to young
Olmsted were the tornado in New Brunmswich, N.J.
and the great fire in New York in 1835. He was
concerned with the possibility of war with

 
Bryan Family Papers 47
France in December, 1835, and January, 1836,
when President Andrew Jackson's special message
is mentioned.

The main portion of the diary concerns the
operation of the Delaware and Raritan Canal.
As engineer George Olmsted made frequent patrols
of the canal and its locks and culverts. He

 

was involved in land surveys, assessing damages
to landowners. along the canal, repairing cracks
and slides, building necessary stables and
blacksmith shops, etc. His wife's cousin,
Captain Robert Field Stockton, had secured the

 
Bryan Family Papers 48

 

charter for the private company to build and
operate the Delaware and Raritan Canal in 1830.
Much of his family fortune was invested in this
project. The diary notes in some detail his
activities. In 1836 the sale of the canal to
the State of New Jersey was debated in the
Legislature, The canal was linked to the Cam-

den and Amboy Railroad. Captain Stockton con-
tinued as president of the company for many
years. His son, Robert Field Stockton (b. 1832),
followed him as president. Noted in the Olmsted
diary are the canal commissioners and the com-

 
Bryan Family Papers 49

 

pany secretary, John Renshaw Thomson. It is
probable that George T. Olmsted came to the
Delaware and Raritan Canal from the Morris
Canal. David Bates Douglass, who worked with
Olmsted, had been with the Morris Canal as an
engineer before he came to the Delaware and
Raritan Canal. Douglass, a Yale graduate of

1813, had been in the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and at West Point as a professor
before he helped to build the Morris Canal.
Mrs. Julia (Olmsted) Bryan came from a very
old family whose home, "Morven", at Princeton,

 
Bryan Family Papers 50
N.J., was still in their possession in the mid-
nineteenth century. Julia (Olmsted) Bryan
inherited an old receipt book (cookbook) from
her mother, Hannah Boudinot (Field) Olmsted.
Hannah and her sister, Mary (Field) Dunbar, had
come into possession of this book through their
mother, Abigail (Stockton) Field, the youngest

 

daughter of Richard and Annis (Boudinot)
Stockton of "Morven", Annis Boudinot married
Richard Stockton, the signer of the Declaration
of Independence, ca. 1762. About the time of
her marriage the manuscript book of colonial

 
Bryan Family Papers SL
receipts was started for her. Mrs. Annis
Stockton added to these early directions as her
own housekeeping progressed. She mentions her
brother, Elisha Boudinot (1749-1818), on p. 30
when she recorded his receipt for curing ham.
Mrs. Annis Stockton was a poetess of some note,
As the generations passed, the change in

 

foods and methods of their preparation is
notable. About p. 73 a new hand begins to
write the receipts, probably that of Abby
(Stockton) Field, Annis' daughter.

It it interesting to note on pp. 103-110 a

 
Bryan Family Papers 52
number of receipts of the famous Mrs. Goodfello
of Philadelphia. One of the Stockton family
may have attended her cookery classes, ca. 180
1815, or at least have known someone who did.
The recéipts in manuscript form are the same ones
which appeared in somewhat more elaborate form
in Eliza Leslie's Seventy-Five Receipts

 

 

(Philadelphia, 1828). Receipts become recipes
as Hannah (Field) Olmsted and her friends enter
directions in the 1850's and 1860's. The final
recipes include some for boxed gelatin and
canned goods. A clipping mentions lessons in

 
Bryan Family Papers 53
cookery by Maria Parloa and another notes ss
Marion Harland's column in the late nineteenth
century.

A section of household remedies is in the
reverse of this notable manuscript volume.

The John Emory Bryant Papers fall into three
main divisions: pre-Civil War Maine; occupation
by U. S. troops, 1861-1864, at Port Royal and
Hilton Head, S. C.; and Reconstruction in Geor-
gia, 1865-1887. The last part of the collec-

tion concerns Bryant's activities working
through the Methodist Episcopal Church of the
North to educate the South, but this section
lacks the details of the earlier papers. No one

 
Bryant, John Emory 2

 

part. of the manuscripts is complete; all
contribute to the history of Bryant as a North-
erner in the South, 1861-1887.

John Emory Bryant (ca. 1835-ca. 1900) came
from Union, Lincoln County, Maine, where his
numerous family had lived for many years. His
father Dr. Benjamin Bryant, was a lay preacher

in the Methodist Church. Young Bryant attended
Maine Wesleyan Seminary at Kent's Hill, alter-
nating in the 1850's study with teaching,
Temperance, abolition, and the position of

 
Bryant, John Emory 3

 

women interested him, and he became active in
Republican politics after 1857.

Evidently Bryant was a strict disciplinarian,
with the result that he changed schools fre-
quently. At the beginning of the Civil War he
was teaching at Buckfield, Maine, where one of
his pupils was Emma Spaulding. Here also he met

Charles Henry Prince, the Buckfield Worthy Pa-
tron of the Sons of Temperance, who later
joined Bryant in politics in Georgia during
Reconstruction. Emma Spaulding married Bryant

 
Bryant, John Emory 4
in 1864, so that some of the letters in the
collection are from her friends and family.
During August, 1861, Bryant became captain of
Company C of the 8th Maine Volunteers. By
November he was aboard the Oriel sailing in the
Union expedition against Port Royal, S. C. His
regimental history of the 8th Maine Volunteers

 

appears (unsigned) in Whitman and True, Maine
in the War for the Union (Lewiston, Me., 1865).

On January 1, 1862, Bryant made a signifi-
cant statement to Emma. He refers to his

 

 
Bryant, John Emory 5
"enemies," who are again conspiring against him.
He has been under arrest for stealing from a
Negro, a charge which was dismissed later. He
says he will come out on top, as he always

looks out for "no. 1." This glimpse of his
personality is prophetic for the career he later
entered.

 

Bryant began to serve as provost marshal in
February, 1862, on Dawfuski Island, S. C.,
where he was in charge of transportation to and
from Fort Vulcan. On March 14, 1862, he writes

 
Bryant, John Emory
that this command of seventy boatmen is "an
answer" to his enemies in Maine. Certainly
his temperance activities were unpopular, both
at home and in the Union Army; and his disci-
pline in the regiment was very strict.

In the fall of 1862 the X Corps of the United
States Army was created with headquarters at

 

Beaufort, S. C. Bryant and the 8th Maine were
in this command doing picket duty at the plan-
tation of Dr. Rosa. The religion of the black
people was described on Sept. 5, 1862, as well

 
Bryant, John Emory 7
as their organization during the absence of
their master. Northern teachers came to do
mission work here,

By December 25, 1862, Bryant had met Major
William Emerson Strong and the Reverend Mans-
field French, who were leaders of the anti-
slavery group at Beaufort, S. C., and whose

 

work resulted in the founding in February, 1863,
of the National Freedman's Relief Association.
By March, 1863, a large corps of teachers had

come to Port Royal sponsored by this group.

 
Bryant, John Emory

Bryant was placed under arrest for four
months early in 1863. He was “at odds" with
Colonel Rust of his regiment. At this time
he states he is going to become a lawyer.

His arrest was lifted by General Rufus
Saxton, whose principal occupation became the
enlistment and organization of Negroes, parti-
cularly ex-slaves, into regiments in the Union
Army. Saxton had Bryant assigned to him for
this special duty, the command of a camp of
black troops. On June 3, 1863, Bryant joined an

 

 
Bryant, John Emory

 

expedition “up river" which brought back 800
ex-Slaves. He declared he had found "a holy
cause," the assistance of a “degraded race,"
Bryant expected to become the lieutenant
colonel of the 3rd South Carolina Volunteers,
a Negro regiment which was being organized,
At this point General Oliver Otis Howard
was made first Commissioner of the Freedmen's
Bureau. The X Corps was under General Quincy
Adams Gillmore. Bryant was impressed by the

great bravery and losses of the 54th Massachu-

 
Bryant, John Emory 10
setts (Negro) in the Charleston Harbor fighting,
The fall of 1863 was spent on scout duty on
Ladies' Island in the Coosaw River and on Barn-

well's Island. On special duty with General
Saxton, whose “confidence" he had gained, he
writes of an expedition to Haywood Plantation to
free its black people. These Negroes, brought

 

back by the Union Army, became part of the
troops organized into regiments.
Meanwhile, the friendship of Bryant and Emma

Spaulding had developed into an engagement to

 
Bryant, John Emory ll
be married. Emma had spent the war years in
sessions at Kent's Hill at the female academy.
For a brief period from April until August,
1864, Bryant went with the 8th Maine to the
battlefront in Virginia. He returned to Maine
on leave in June, 1864, when he married Emma
Spaulding. By Sept. 9, 1864, he was mustered

 

out of the service at the end of afar enlist-
ment. A

Bryant stayed briefly at Kent's Hill in Maine
in October, 1864, before returning to Georgia

 
Bryant, John Emory iz

 

to work as agent in the Freedmen's Bureau at
Augusta under General Saxton, who was appointed
Assistant Commissioner for South Carolina,
Georgia, and Florida. Although his formal
appointment was dated May 15, 1865, Bryant was
engaged in the affairs of the Freedmen's Bureau
before that date. He was suggesting in Septem-

ber, 1865, that northern lawyers be appointed
to its various branches. (His activities are
noted in his scrapbooks and letter books for
this confused year when the Freedmen's Bureau

 
Bryant, John Emory 13
was getting underway. In the 0. R. W. R., I,
vol. XLVII, pt. 3, p. 665, is a report of
Brigadier General Edward L. Molineaux, Depart-
ment of Northern Georgia, which narrates the
disorders of 1865. In the solution of these
disorders Bryant was involved as an agent of
the Bureau. (Bryant is also referred to in

 

August 2, 1865, in the E. W. Kingsley Papers in
this department. )
General Davis Tillson became Director of the

Freedmen's Bureau for Georgia in September, 186

 
Bryant, John Emory 14

 

Bryant almost immediately had trouble with
General Tillson.

His newspaper career began ca. December,
1865, while he was still “sub-assistant commis-
sioner" at Augusta. He was directing the Co-
lored American of Augusta in December, 1865,
when it merged with the Loyal Georgian, the

 

 

paper which Bryant edited for the Georgia Equal
Rights Association.

Emma (Spaulding) Bryant had come to Augusta
by February, 1866, despite the dangerous times

 
Bryant, John Emory 15

 

for outsiders,

In April, 1866, a series of letters began
from Henry McNeal Turner (1834-1915), preacher,
black Republican leader, legislator, and post-
master of Augusta, Turner became a bishop in
the African Methodist Church, 1880-1892. He
was a black politician who remained the friend

of Bryant. The question of Negro suffrage was

acute at the time his correspondence commenced,
Bryant tried very hard to make a success of

the Loyal Georgian by building subscriptions,

 

 
Bryant, John Emory 16
In May, 1866, he was vigorously opposing General
Tillson, and evidently tried to attack him in
the Loyal Georgian. The quarrel resulted in
Bryant's leaving the Freedmen's Bureau to prac-
tice law with Captain Christopher C. Richardson,
formerly of the 12th Maine Volunteers. Charges
against him of defrauding Negroes were dismissed,

 

 

By November, 1866, General Tillson was retired,
but Bryant was out of the Freedmen's Bureau.
This was his first big fight in Georgia.

From this time forward he is constantly

 
Bryant, John Emory 17

 

seeking and not very often holding political
appointments for services to the Republican
Party im Georgia. Isaac Avery called Bryant "an
unexampled manipulator of the black element for
years, until in 1880 he was finally unhorsed."
He combined a deft pen and a glib tongue to
present Reconstruction in its humanitarian

aspects; at the same time he had "a keen clutch"
on the more practical side of the "untutored
colored intelligence,"

Negro leaders, white Republican politicians,

 
Bryant, John Emory 18

 

white teachers of blacks, and Methodist mini-
sters formed the largest group of correspon-
dents. Bryant first used the need for black
education to solicit funds in the North. Then
after 1876 he turned to the Methodist Church
for financial aid in the education of poor
white people. During this time he constantly
worked very hard for the Republican Party in
Georgia, both in the Presidential campaigns
and in local elections.

The second great fight of Bryant's career

 
Bryant, John Emory 19

 

came when he joined the opposition to Governor
Rufus Bullock and his friend, Foster Blodgett,
who came into power in Georgia with the new
state constitution in 1868. The Union League,
highly efficient and secretive, spread across
Georgie, with the Ku Klux Klan rising to combat
it. Bryant in his papers continued to refer to

the League for many years. Intricate maneuvers
and wild scrambles for patronage control fill
the Bryant correspondence, which contains a
morass of names, both local and national,

 
Bryant, John Emory 20

 

By this time Bryant was publishing the Geor-
gia Republican.

Evidently many matters of local politics
were handled for President Grant by James Madi-
son Edmunds, the postmaster at Washington, D. C.
Personelities range from Horace Porter, Simon
Cameron, and Columbus Delano to Joseph E.

Brown, Benjamin H. Hill, and John Pendleton
King. The patronage struggle was ferocious.
Later Roscoe Conkling, Hannibal Hamlin, James G.
Blaine, and Chester Arthur each had his influ-
ence in this fight.

 

 
Bryant, John Emory 21

There is little or no material in 1870 on
Bryant's attempt to become Speaker of the
Georgia House,

By 1871 the figure of Volney Spalding appear
as Bryant's lieutenant in politics and publish-
ing in Atlanta. James Atkins, also of Atlanta,
a white Republican, entered the papers. He was

 

hoping for and secured the collectorship of
customs at Savannah. Bryant wrote to Presi-
dent U. S. Grant and continued to write to

every Republican President through Benjamin

 
Bryant, John Emory 22
Harrison, together with their political lieute-
nants. Not only did he publish Republican
newspapers; he wrote and printed many political
broadsides and pamphlets while in Georgia.

The campaign of 1872 with its great political
activity and resultingly large correspondence
brought to Bryant as a reward for his political
work the deputy collectorship of customs at
Savannah,

By 1872 the Republican Party of Georgia was

split. Governor Bullock fled, but the party

 

 
Bryant, John Emory 23

 

members were left with bitter feuds, one of
which was caused by the attack of Bryant upon
the Negro politician Edward Belcher. His friend
Charles Henry Prince, wrote that many Republi-
cans did not approve of Bryant's appointment to
the Customs House. Nevertheless, Bryant be-
came chairman of the Republican State Central

Committee and was nominated by them and ran for
the Congress in 1874 from the lst District
of Georgia. Part of Bryant's duties at the

Customs House was control of patronage, a

 
Bryant, John Emory au

 

strenuous job because of the constant attempts
to oust incumbents of federal offices. Bryant
supported Blaine for the Presidency, so that he
must have expected rewards from Blaine in the
patronage race,

The Bryants from the beginning of their stay
in Georgia were interested in the work of the
Methodist Episcopal Church among the blacks
and poor whites, On July 16, 1873, Robert T.
Kent described the poverty of the Negro Metho-
dist churches in the Macon District. The

 
Bryant, John Emory 253
friendship of Bryant with the Reverend Erasmus
Q. Fuller, minister of the Marietta Street
Methodist Church in Atlanta and editor of the
Methodist Advocate, is first noted on July 25,
1873, but it dated back to 1868.

By 1876 Bryant and James Atking have become
political enemies, even though both men worked

 

in the Customs House. The third major battle
of Bryant's career raged against Atkins, et al.
The latter published a pamphlet addressed to

the President of the United States attacking

 
Bryant, John Emory

 

Bryant and tried to have him dismissed from the
Customs House. (See printed materials -- pam-
phlets.) President Hayes finally removed Bry-
ant. This terrible struggle in 1876-1877 was
for all practical purposes the end of Bryant's
political career in Georgia, although he re-
mained in the Republican party there for another
ten years,

Bryant retired to Atlanta, where he became
the business manager of the Atlanta Republican
Publishing Company and editor of the Georgia

 
Bryant, John Emory 27
Republican. After 1878 he spent many months

at a time speaking and soliciting funds in the
North for his southern educational work for the
Methodist Church. Though absent, Bryant re-
tained his chairmanship of the Republican State
Central Committee, Many references to and
letters from Methodist leaders enter the corres-

 

pondence, as he tried to emphasize the work of
the Methodist Church in the South.

In 1880 William Anderson Pledger took over
the chairmanship of the Republican State Central

 
Bryant, John Emory 28

 

Committee from Bryant. An able young black
Republican who began party work about 1870,
Pledger was editor of the Augusta Blade and a
temperance worker,

Bryant centered his work on promotion of the
Southern Advance Association in the large cities
of the East. But he still sought a political

position and succeeded in 1884 in securing a
short term as United States Marshal of North
Georgia.

It is interesting to note that Bryant fought

 
Bryant, John Emory

 

for Negro suffrage, but was horrified by the
thought that such a right belonged to women,
Emma Bryant, who suffered through a life of
hardship, poverty, and obedience, would never
accept his position on the rights of women, as
she plainly stated in 1883.

The name of East Tennessee Wesleyan Univer-

sity first appears in that year. Located in
Athens, Tennessee, and supported by Unionists
of the region, this college was ideal for pro-
motion by the Southern Advance Association and

 
Bryant, John Emory 30
the Methodist Church. Its name was changed to
Grant Memorial University in honor of the de-
ceased President. (Later it became U. S. Grant
University; then, Tennessee Wesleyan).

With the election of the Democratic President,
Grover Cleveland, a tremendous turn-over in fed-
eral office holders took place. Bryant and

 

Thomas G. Baker attempted to revive the Union
Leagues of the country, asking Charles H.
Grosvenor to head the organization,

It was becoming very difficult to finance the

 
Bryant, John Emory 31

 

southern educational work which Bryant was try-
ing to advance. In 1887 Emma Bryant took her
daughter Alice to Grant Memorial University,
where she §$aught to support herself and educate
her daughter. Bryant entered business early in
1888 in New York City to secure money to con-
tinue his southern work, but he left in a short

time to enter real estate promotion in Mt. Ver-
non, New York, Here Emma Bryant joined him
after the graduation of Alice Bryant from

Grant Memorial. Bryant took a last fling at

 
Bryant, John Emory 32
newspaper work on the Mount Vernon Chronicle-
Record. He was also involved in local political
controversy in Mt. Vernon. After his death ca.
1900, Emma Bryant went to Ohio to live with her
daughter, Alice (Bryant) Zeller.

The legal papers are miscellaneous in charac-
ter, referring to the events of Bryant's career.

The financial papers are also miscellaneous,
a better picture of the finances of Bryant being
shown by his account books,

The official papers and writings also follow

 

 
Bryant, John Emory oe
the pattern of Bryant's life. They fall into
two groups: political and Methodist. Bryant
wrote many contributions for his newspapers
which he clipped and pasted in small folders,
also doOing the same for the writings of others
in which he was interested.

Among the volumes are copies of the journal

 

kept by Bryant as a young man. Only Volumes 1,
3, and 5 have survived, preserved in abbreviated,
almost illegible form in notebooks. They give a
glimpse of his early life in Maine and at

 
Bryant, John Emory 34

 

Maine Wesleyan Seminary at Kent's Hill, the
events of which form a basis for understanding
the development of his character and career.
Corporal punishment, discipline, and the law
evidently made deep impressions upon him.

Emme Bryant kept two volumes of a journal,
1866 and 1876. The first one is a valuable

addition to the history of the personnel of the
Freedmen's Bureau in Augusta, Georgia. She
describes what the Negroes were doing at that

time.

 
Bryant, John Emory 35
Alice Zeller also wrote. Her autobiographi-
cal sketch contains much of human interest about
the life of her parents from ca. 1870-1890.
Also among the volumes are a number of letter
books, letterpress books, and scrapbooks, all
of which contain valuable materials for the
story of Reconstruction in Georgia.

 

The letter book, 1876-1878, of John E. Bryant
contains his correspondence as well as that of
his assistant in Atlanta, Volney Spalding.

It begins with the campaign of Bryant for

 

 
Bryant, John Emory 36

 

Congress in 1876 and his fight when deputy
collector of revenue at Savannah against the
collector, James Atkins. The founding of the
Georgia Republican in Atlanta is followed by
the fight against the ratification of the new
state constitution in 1877, Reference is also
made to the location of the state capitol at

Atlanta and the Homestead Act of 1868.

The second letter book, 1888-1890, kept by
Bryant is a record of his business ventures in
New York City, as well as a number of letters

 

 
Bryant, John Emory 37

 

on the “Southern Problem,"

Bryant had a young Negro friend, William
Anderson Pledger (1852- ), who kept a letter-
press book, 1875-1879, as well as a scrapbook.
Pledger was a member of a large family. He
received one year of schooling in a mission
school in Atlanta taught by Sarah Jane Twichell
(later Mrs. Edmund Asa Ware). Thereafter he
was self-educated. He served as a railroad
mail guard, as a school teacher, as a Republican
politician, and as a temperance crusader.

 
Bryant, John Emory 38
Biographical notes in the letterpress book

indicate he tried in 1874-1875 to move a colony
of Negroes from Clarke County, Georgia, to Jef-
ferson County, Mississippi, where he expected

to teach school. This experience was a disil-
lusionment for Pledger, who was blamed for any
dissatisfaction which arose among the freedmen.

 

His search for a political appointment for his
Republican Party activity also was unfruitful.
He was desperate for employment. Meanwhile he
was deeply involved in the Independent Order of

 
Bryant, John Emory 39

 

Good Templars, whose "fountains" he visited to
promote temperance among the freedmen,

The Bryant Papers contain three C. S. A.
Army letter books which belonged to Confederate
forces in Georgia. These books were probably
found by Captain Christopher C. Richardson of
the 12th Maine Volunteers who was stationed at

Griffin, Georgia, for a short time in 1865.
Almost immediately Richardson and Bryant began
to use these volumes for their own records.

Volume 1, Mar. 4-July 13, 1864, was from the

 
Bryant, John Emory 40

 

headquarters of Brigadier General Raleigh Edward
Colston's Brigade at Ft. Bartow, Georgia, where
he held a command in the defense of the Savannah
River. The correspondence noted is official.

In this volume Capt. C. C. Richardson entered
lists of Confederates taking the amnesty oath
in 1865 in Brooks, Valdosta, Echols, and
Lowndes counties, Georgia.

These are followed by memoranda from the law
office of Richardson and Bryant in Augusta
which was in charge of a Negro clerk named G.

 
Bryant, John Emory 41

 

B. Snowden. Snowden also kept in this book
the minutes of the Republican Club of Augusta,
Georgia, Mar. 25-Sept. 11, 1868.

Volume 2, Jan. 3, 1863-April 20, 1864,
contains copies of official correspondence of
the Camps of Instruction for Conscripts in the
8th Congressional District of Georgia. The
volume contains details on conscript organiza-
tion, exemptions, substitutes, health, and
personnel, Macon and Decatur, Georgia, con-
tained, respectively, Camps Cooper and Randolph

 

 
Bryant, John Emory baie 42
for receiving these troops.

In this letter book, one year later, Bryant
began his own letter book for the Freedmen's
Bureau at Augusta, where he was serving under
General Saxton. The correspondence, largely
telegraphic, reveals the chaotic conditions
among the destitute Negroes who thronged into
Augusta. Bryant tried to establish a branch
bureau at Hamburg, S. C., under command of Negro
officers and men from the 33rd U. S. Volunteers.

Volume 3, also 1863-1864, is the letter book

 

 

 

 
Bryant, John Emory 43

 

 

of the commandant of “conscription in the 7th
Congressional District of Georgia, centering in
Macon and Griffin, Georgia.

In this book Bryant pasted the letters of
General Rufus Saxton, 1865, and clippings from
the Loyal Georgian, 1866.

Among the scrapbooks which John Emory Bryant

 

was fond of compiling is one dated 1861-1864,
containing letters and papers concerning his
service in the 8th Maine Volunteers in South

Carolina,

 
Bryant, John Emory 4b

 

scribbled in the first pages of this book
are notes made by Bryant at a hearing on the
Freedmen's Bureau in the summer of 1866 at Au-
gusta, Georgia, where a Negro committee answered
the questions of Generals Steedman, Fullerton,
and Tillson.

(General Saxton was in command of the Freed-

men's Bureau in 1865, when he had only two
agents in Georgia. One was Bryant whose ap-
pointment is dated May 15, 1865. Bryant soon
collided with the military, so that he was

 
Bryant, John Emory 45

 

already fighting before General Tillson took
over in September, 1865.)

The Bryant Papers contain three other scrap-
books, 1868-1894, two of which belong to Bryant
and one to William A. Pledger. Both contribute
details about life in Georgia during Reconstruc-
tion. Of interest are the clippings from many
local Georgia newspapers. The Pledger scrap-
book illustrates many phases of Negro life as
well as his career.

Eight scrapbooks were compiled after 1887

 
Bryant, John Emory ee 46
when Bryant was in New York City and Mt. Vernon,
N. Y., and his wife and daughter in Athens,
Tenn. The Zeller scrapbooks concern Grant
Memorial University, temperance, and the posi-
tion of women,

Numerous account books reflect Bryant's
business ventures from 1873 until 1899. Of

 

interest is the register, 1873-1875, of the
staff of the Savannah Customs House with their
contributions to the Republican Party.

The printed materials include loose clippings

 
Bryant, John Emory 4
which follow the pattern of Bryant's career,
giving details of his work in the Freedmen's
Bureau, and as a Republican leader of Georgia
Negroes. After 1876 there are many clippings
on the work of the Methodist Church in the South,
(Scrapbooks contain many mounted clippings.)
Bryant was long involved in publishing to

 

further his political interests; hence his
papers contain valuable printed materials, some
of which are rare illustrations of events
during Reconstruction. The broadsides and

 
Bryant, John Emory

 

pamphlets that came with this collection were
transferred to their respective collections in
this library, but Xerox copies of them were
retained with Bryant's papers.
A picture of the faculty and student body of
Grant Memorial University in 1891 is with the
collection.

Three histories of Reconstruction in Georgia
are important guides to the papers, although
each has a different viewpoint: First, Isaac
Avery, History of the State of Georgia 1850-

 

 

 
Bryant, John Emory 49
1881 (1881); second, C. Mildred Thompson, Re-
construction in Georgia (1915); and third,
Allan Conway, The Reconstruction of Georgia
(1966). Bentley's History of the Freedmen's
Bureau (1955) and Morrow's Northern Methodism

and Reconstruction (1956) are also of great
value.

(1851) and Whitman and True, Maine in the War

William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878) began his
literary career in 1817 after a brief trial at
the practice of law. He was connected with The
Evening Post of New York City and wrote numerous
poems which became popular during his career.

 

His papers are a miscellaneous collection of
letters and copies of his poems.

An interesting letter of Feb. 13, 1839, to
Churchill caldom Cambreleng concerns the method
of settling a bankruptcy case in New York under

 
Bryant, William Cullen. _. 2
a Federal act of 1500.

On Apr. 29, 1843, Bryant wrote to William
Gilmore Simms to relate the events of his
vacation in St. Augustine.

In a letter of July 26, 1844, he enclosed a
copy of a translation of a poem by N. Muller and
recommended to George Rex Graham that John H.

 

Bryant's poems be published in Graham's journal.
Bryant discussed William Bacon Steven's
History of Georgia in a letter to Israel K.
Tefft, Apres 27, LO49.
Letters of 1858 concern his trip to Europe.

 
Bryant, William Cullen 2
A letter of March 2, 1059, to George Harvey alsa
relates to his tour. Bryant discussed monetary
policy and the lack of public respect for
President James Buchanan.

He wrote to Julia (Ward) Howe on Nov. 2l,
1864, to express his regrets that her publisher
had done such a poor job of editing her poetry.

 

Bryant included a letter to Andrew Johnson in
a letter to Lyman Trumbull, Jan. 12, 1866. It
concerned his brother John, but was apparently
forwarded by Trumbull to Johnson and is not
included in this collection. A letter to his

 
Bryant, William Cullen
brother concerns John's poetry and the treatment
of mental illness.

He wrote a letter of introduction for Mrs.
Candace Wheeler to George Bancroft, then
ambassador to Germany (Oct. 9, 1871). Letters
to Mrs. Wheeler include a response to an
invitation for lunch (Mar. 9, 1875) and his
assent to write a poem for a paper to be issued
at a fair to be held by the Y.W.C.A. (Jan. 31,
1876). Mrs. Bryant wrote Mrs. Wheeler thanking
her for her expressions of sympathy at the death
of W. C. Bryant (1878).

 

 
Bryant, William Cullen §

An undated letter to Bryant from Johannes
Adam Simon Oertel enclosed illustrations to
accompany one of Bryant's poems. These illus-
trations were apparently returned to Oertel,
for on the reverse side of his letter is a ppr-
tion of a note to Oertel concerning a visit to
his studio to view this series. The author of

 

the fragment is unidentified. This item was
added when the collection was recataloged.
Other letters include notes from Bryant to
various publishers, autograph seekers, and
similar miscellaneous material. There are also

ond time to Elizabeth Taliaferro Harrison, widow

of Thomas Harrison of Loudon Co., Va. His chil-

wheat to the Valley Mills and perhaps also en-
gaging in bridge building. His children were
rather well educated, being taught in 1813 by
Joel Oxley. Tate Bryarly was the oldest child,
serving in the War of 1812. The other children
were one daughter who married H. C. Dunbar;
Louisa who married a Bryarly; Thomas F., Thorn-
ton, Richard S., William C. F., and Rowland.
The Bryarly family is an excelent illustra-
tion of the typical Va. family of the early 19t
century in that the numerous sons went west and
southwest in settling in Ohio, Tennessee, and

 
BRYARLY, Samuel, Sketch, ae
Mississippi. Tate Bryarly settled in Clarks-
ville, Tenn., and became a very prosperous mer-
chant and bridge builder; Thomas went to Ohio,
while Thomnton and Rowland went to Mississippi.
From this standpoint the letters are interesting
and illuminating, being filled with incidents
relative to conditions in the new regions.

John Buchanan(1772-1844), was born in
Prince Georges county, Maryland. He was educated
at Charlotte Hall Academy, and read law in the
office of Roberk White of Winchester, Va. and of
John Thompson Mason of Hagerstown, Maryland. He

served in the lower house of the state legisla-
ture 1797-1799. He became associate justice of
the Maryland court of appeals in 1806. In 1824

he became chief justice of the appellate court

 
Buchanan, John. (2)

 

 

of Maryland where he served until his death,
except for the year 1837 when he went to Lofridon
to negotiate the sale of state secured railroad
and canal stock.

Buchanan is considered one of Maryland's
greatest jurists. He sought his decisions in the

analysis of social and economic factors which
produced the cause rather than in the compila-
tion of legal precedents.

The collection contains the rppert card for
Thomas Buchanan, then a student at Didkinson
College(1825) and an estimate of the expenses

ently did not do well at Dickinson and brans-
ferred to Georgetown.

Captain Samuel D. Buck of Co. H, 13th
Va. Vol. Infantry, C. S. A. Army, wrote about
1890 his reminiscences*of the Civil War,
Apr. 19, 1861, through 1865, His regiment
gained fame as skirmishers. He did not leave

it till Mar., 1865, when it had literally
been shot to pieces. Col. Ambrose Powell
Hill was head of the regiment till he was
made a brigadier general, and he and his men
followed "Stonewall" Jackson through the fa-

mous Valley Campaign Chancellorsville.
* Over

 
Buck, Samuel D. 2
Capt. Buck fought in practically every major

battle but Gettysburg under Jackson and Jubal
Anderson Early. He was wounded at the Battle
of the Wilderness and returned to service dur-
ing the siege of Petersburg. He gives many
details of troop movements, conduct of gener-

 

als, battles, and camp life. The manuscript
opens with the mobilization of the Confederate
Army around Harper's Ferry, W. Va., and he
comments on health conditions.among the
troops. Lt. Col. James Alexander Walker and
Maj. James B. a officers, later

 
Buck, Samuel D. 3
became Confederate generals. Buck comments

on their careers, especially noting the char-
acter of A. P. Hill. Marches to Romney ,

W. Va., and to Winchester, Va., in 1861,
bring comment on Gen. Joseph Eggleston John-
ston and his opponent, Federal @en. Robert

 

Patterson. After the skirmish of the 5th

Va. at Falling Water, the C. S. A. troops go
to aid Beauregard at Manassas, the only in-
stance Buck remembers when the soldiers were
told where they were going. During the winter
of 1861-62 at Camp ry Fairfax Court House,

 
Buck, Samuel D. &
Va., the camp life of the troops and the
Character of A. P. Hill are described. Mar.
23, 1862, brings news of Jackson at Kernstown,
Va. In April one-year Confederate enlist-
ments expire. The C. S. A. Congress "forces"
each man to stay in the army. Buck's regi-

 

ment is sent by way of Swift Run Gap to the
army of Jackson in the Valley. Here Buck
comments on Richard S. Ewell and "Stonewall"
Jackson as soldiers. The First Valley Cam-
paign by Jackson in 1862 opens with many Con-

federates regarding i and his audacious

 
Buck, Samuel D, 5
secrecy as wild and reckless. His defeat of

Nathaniel Prentiss Banks is described, begin-
ning with the Battle of New Market, May 20,

1862. Turner Ashby's cavalry plays its role,
as Buck and the infantry become "foot caval-
ry." Casualties are described here and else-

 

where throughout the manuscript whenever a
battle is fought. Jackson drives to Winches-
ter, Charlestown, and Harper's Ferry; then he
retreats up the Valley between the armies of
Fremont and Shields. Fighting at Harrison-
burg and Cross mae) » shows the high

 
Buck, Samuel D,. 6
morale of the C. S. A. Army under Jackson.
The death of Turner Ashby leading the 58th
Va. Vols. is described.

Buck comments on the care of the wounded
on the field by the Ambulance Corps. From the
Battle of Port Republic, June 9, 1862, the

 

narrative continues to Richmond and the Seven
Days Battle: The Battle at Gaines' Mill,
June 27, 1862, caused many casualties among
the 13th Va. Vols. Casual mention is made of
the hospital of the Univ. of Va. at Charlot-

tesville, of a i and Liberty Mills.

 
Buck, Samuel D. 7
Then the campaign of Second Bull Run opens

with the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Aug. 9

 

?

1862. Comment on John Pope is always con-
temptuous. The regiment under Col. Jas. A.
Walker in Gen. J. A. Early's division has a
bitter fight at Cedar Mountain, where Buck

praises the gallantry of the Stonewall Bri-
gade. Buck marches with Jackson's army to
the rear of Pope, commenting on army food,

or lack of it. He describes the charge of
Early's Brigade at 2nd Bull Run, goes on to
Chantilly (Ox Hill) a 1, 1862, and the

 
Buck, Samuel D, 8
crosses the Potomac into Maryland to start

the Antietam campaign. Maryland does not
rise to greet the C. S. A. Army. Given a
first lieutenant's commission while at Fre-
derick, Md., Buck goes with Jackson to cap-
ture Harper's Ferry and then on to Antietam.

 

There his regiment serves as "foot cavalry"
with J. E. B. Stuart. The role of John Pel-
ham's Battery, the awful fire, and the re-
pulse of Hooker and Sumner are recorded.
Heavy casualties and retreat follow. The
13th Va. helps A. 7 - hold the ford at

 
Buck, Samuel D. 9
the Potomac. A description of tearing up
railroads in the winter of 1862 is followed
by an account of the 13th Va. at Fredericks-
burg, Dec. 13, 1862, where A. E. Burnside

and the U. S. Army attempt to bridge the
Rappahannock in the face of Barksdale's Missis

 

sippi Brigade. . Longstreet's Corps,

J. E. B. Stuart, and Pelham's artillery,
Jackson from the Valley, Lee, all play their
roles. A. P. Hill's Division fights Reynolds,
and Buck serves in Early's Division as they

come in to am } P., Hill. Comment

 
Buck, Samuel D,. 10
on Hooker's reorganization of the U. S. Army

is followed by the Battle of Chancellorsville,
during which Early's Division remains at Fre-
dericksburg and fights John Sedgwick and the
U. S. Army. Jackson's death brings a eulogy.
In June, 1863, Buck is back in the Valley,

 

fighting under Early at the Second Battle of
Winchester, Va. He thus misses the Gettys-
burg campaign. In the fall of 1863 he de-
scribes actions at Bristoe Station and Mine
Run, Va., serving under Gen. John Pegram. He
becomes a captain "oe 1864, when he

 
Buck, Samuel D, ii
writes a graphic description of a line of
soldiers going into battle (p. 93). His 13th
Va. marches against U. S. Grant in the Battle
of the Wilderness, where Buck gives a vivid
account of the grim battle, the dangers of a
picket line, the casualties, and the confusion

Simon Bolivar Buckner (1823-1914) was born in
Hart co., Ky., the son of Aylett Hartswell and
Elizabeth Ann (Morehead) Buckner. In 1844 he
graduated from the U.S.Military Academy, served
in the Mexican War, taught ethics and infantry

tactics at West Point from 1845 to 1850, resigred
from the U.S.army on Mar. 26, 1855, rose to the
rank of lieut. general in the Confed. army, was

governor of Ky. from 1887 to 1891, and ran for
he vice-presidency on the Gold Democratic tickt

 
Buckner, Simon B.
in 1896.

The four items which constitute this collectia
are two letters, a clipping concerning the death
of Gen.Buckner, and an autograph. The first lett
er is a copy of one that was weitten by Buckner
from Knoxville on June 23, 1863 to Gen. Samuel
Cooper. It @ontains a copy of a brief letter

 

lost by a Federal officer which was written by a
lady in Louisville, Ky. She said that many Fed-
eral troops had been moving constantly through

the city during the past several days, that Gen.
Burnside had been ordered to Washington since it

 
Buckner, Simon Bolivar

was threatened by the Rebels, that his campaign
in Ky. had been a short one, and that a large
number of ambulances had passed through on their
return to Cincinnati. The second letter was
written by Buckner from Alexandfia, La. in Nov.
1864 to a lady cousin. He wrote facetiously
about his subjugation: as a married man.

Buckner to Jesse C. Green in response to
a request for an autograph.

attending Mrs. Carrington's school in Richmond,
Henrico Co., Va., but not a permanent resident

 

of that city. Various subjects, including

cussed. ",..on Tuesday morning cJan. 11, 18483,"

"garden spot" "under any other government."
Having travelled in Cal., Jamaica, New Grenada,
Mexico, and Cuba, Carter is prepared to live

 

elsewhere, presumably Neb. Glowing with en-
thusiasm over various places, especially Cal.

quent land sales in Mo.; travel in Va., I111l.,

St. Louis and other places in Mo. While he has
high praise for Mo. and its environs, he speaks,
too, of insufficient rain for corn and gardens

 

and the failure of the wheat crop. "The ground
is rich and loose," he writes, "the wind blew
all the ground from the roots of the wheat in
march all the wheat died for want of rain...."

But, he maintains, thw worst land in Mo. and

thereabouts is far richer than the best in Va.

The letters written by the women of the
family reveal some interesting facts. During

the war Catherine McGeachy taught school in
Bladen Co. She taught about a dozen students
and received around forty dollars per month,

The scarcity of pins, needles, hairpins, cloth,
ribbon, etc. was extremely trying. The Yankee
raids for food, the “oe of property, and

the fear aroused by the behavior of the freed
Negro are well described by these women.

In the summer of 1866 Catherine McGeachy
married Duncan A. Buie, who was evidently a mer-
chant and farmer at Buie's Store, N. C. The
problems arising from free Negro labor and finan
Cial difficulties weighed heavily on the young
couple. It seems that Duncan later turned to
school teaching. In 1892 Catherine was post-
mistress at Buie, N. C.

On July 25, 1861, Thomas D. "Bulluck," of

his mother “Mrs Bashuva Bulluck." Judging from
the contrast between the penmanship and ex-
pression in this letter and that in most of the

perhaps the son had employed someone to write fo

This collection includes the papers of sev-
eral generations of members of the Bullock
family of southern Virginia and central North
Carolina. The earliest papers are those of
John and William H. Bullock. The bulk of the
papers until around 1870 belongs to a second
John Bullock and his wife Susan M. (Cobb)
Bullock. From around 1875, the correspondence
is directed principally to Judith (Watkins)
Bullock, wife of Walter Bullock and daughter-

 

 
Bullock, John 2
in-law of John and Susan Bullock. This later
correspondence consists of letters to Judith
(Watkins) Bullock from her daughter Rebecca
("Beck") Farrar, her other children, and her
many grandchildren. The last letters are to
one "Buddie" and other wnidentified persons.
Members of the Bullock family were linked

 

by marriage to the Goode, Farrar, Taylor, Boyd,
Hamilton, and Pearson families whose names
apvear frequently in the correspondence. There
are numerous letters to Mrs. Sallie (Tarry)

 
Bullock, John 5
Harrison; but her relationship to the Bullocks
can not be determined* Since these letters
were received with the Bullock papers, they
have been filed with them.

A letter of Aug. 20, 1839, from John Bullock
to his wife describes his efforts to raise
silkworms and to manufacture sikk cloth. A

 

letter dated Apr. 26, 1858, discusses a serious
dispute among the faculty and students at the
University of North Carolina.

cusses Gov. Zebulon Vance (June 24, 1864} and
Braxton Bragg (Feb. 18, 1864). Letters to
Walter describe secessionist sentiment and
racial incidents in Granville Co. after
Lincoln's election (Nov. 22 and Dec. 4, 1860).
There is also an undated role of the Nutbush
Company, 37th Regt. of the militia.
Significant printed material includes three

titled "To the Churchmen ...", is addressed to
the dioceses of the Southeast and discusses
plans for expansion of the paper The Church
Year.

Other topics discussed in the correspondence
include: St. Augustine, Fla. (Dec. 31, 1892);

 

 

Union Seminary, Richmond Va. (Jan. 20, 1837)3
religious attitudes in Tenn. (Dec. 5, 1899);
criticism in N.C. of the Spanish-American War
(Apr. 2 and July 7, 1898); and Shelby, N.C.

(June 28, 1894).

 
Bullock, John 6
The two volumes in this collection are

diaries kept by Mrs. Susan M. (Cobb) Bullock.

A small volume records her trip to the mountains
of N.C. and Tenn. in 1848. A second diary, kept
in one of her husband's account books, is a
daily record from 1869 until early 1871. This
book is a source for much of the information

 

identifying the members of the Sullock family.
Mrs. Bullock mentions the shortage of labor
resulting from emancipation (Jan. 13, 1869),
farming conditions, a severe drought in 1869,

 
Bullock, John 7
and much local news.

The Bullocks were active Presbyterians, and
numerous references are made to the Nutbush
Presbyterian Church, of which John Bullock was
an elder, and other Presbyterian churches and
meetings. Later generations of the Bullock
family were Epicopalians and discuss their

 

churches and priestsin their correspondence.
Information of the Bullocks can be found in

Samuel Thomas Peace’s history of Vance Co.,

zeb's Black Baby, Susan Bullock's diary, and an

 

 
Bullock, John 8
undated letter containing some genealogical
information. A letter of Nov. 17, 1900,
indicates that a member of the family was
collecting the Bullock family papers, but no
other mention of this collection is given.

Mrs. Sally (Tarry) Harrison was the mother
of Judith (Watkins) Bullock. Sally Harrison

 

was married three times, successivély to

Mr. Watkins, Charles E. Hamilton, and

Mr. Harrison. Her correspondence and family
information are also in the William Tarry

Jabez Bunting (1779-1858), Methodist minis-
ter, was stationed after 1533 at the denomina-
tional headquarters in London where he filled
the chief posts of influence and authority.

A letter of Jan. 16, 1836, from George Grey,
Under Secretary for the Colonies, concerned the

use by the Wesleyan MiSsionary Society of a
parliamentary grant for the establishment of
Negro schools in the British West Indies. The
views of Lord Glenelg, Colonial Secretary, were

noted.

This collection consists of five and a frac-
tion letters from Dr. Joseph Davis Heacock,
whose address was Weewokaville, Talladega Coun-
ty, Alabama, to his niece Sarah W. Bunting, a
letter from him to his sister, presumably Sarah‘

mother, and a letter by Joseph D. Heacock's son,
Dr. John William Heacock of Alpine, Talladega
County, conveying the news of his father's

death in 1867.

 
Bunting, Sarah W. 2
According to Thomas M. Owen's Dictionary of

Alabama Biography, Joseph D. Heacock migrated

to Alabama from Chester County, Pennsylvania,

in 1821 and married Rebecca M. Garner of Madison

County, Alabama. They later settled in Talla-

dega County. This, according to E. Grace Jemi-

son, Historic Tales of Talladega, was either in

 

 

 

 

1833 or 1834. One of their sons, Robert Patrick
Henry, who is mentioned in some of his father's
letters, was killed as a captain in the Confed-

erate Army.

 
Bunting, Sarah W. 3
The letters by Joseph D. Heacock contain
information about family members, personal mat-

ters, crops and weather conditions, an Arctic
expedition led by Dr. Elisha Kent Kane, slavery,
and a few other subjects. His adamant defense
of slavery is presented in lengthy detail and
reveals his feeling that the work of the aboli-

 

tionists may cause a disruption of the Union,
He had become a slaveholder, and at least one
of his sons also came to own slaves. The rel-
atives in Pennsylvania to whom he was writing

 
Bunting, Sarah W.

were members of the Society of Friends. He
admonishes that organization for meddling in
the matter of slavery, about which they and all
the abolitionists know very little, he maintain
It appears from comments in the letters that he
kept in touch with a number of Northern rela-

 

tives by correspondence and Managed, despite
their strong difference over slavery, to main-
tain family ties. The fact that he succeeded
in doing this even through the Civil War is ob-
vious from his son's letter in 1867. The

 
Bunting, Sarah W. >:

 

frequent mention of letters not being received
that were said to have been mailed may be re-
vealing about the quality of the postal service
at least in the South before the Civil War.

In the first letter, dated Oct. 6, 1851,
Joseph D. Heacock muses on a daguerreotype his
niece had sent of her mother and his sister,

whom he had not seen since she was a young wo-
man. He says there are many daguerreotypists
in his area and that he had long thought of
learning the art but for one thing he was wait-

 
Bunting, Sarah W, 6

 

ing to see if the ability to produce colored

daguerreotypes would, as was expected, develop
soon. He comments on the death of his brother
about whom his niece had informed him. In this
letter, as in other letters, he expresses deep
religious convictions, and mentions that great

revivals have taken place in that part of the
country. He credits the Baptists, his own
faith, and Methodists principally for the re-
vivals where thousands, among them a "good many
slaves," had accepted Christ.

 
Bunting, Sarah W. 7

 

On Mar. 8, 1855, Heacock wrote a fourteen-
page letter to his niece in response to her in-
quiry as to his opinion of Harriet Beecher
Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. His view was that
Mrs. Stowe had very limited knowledge of the
"African character." In rationalizing about

 

slavery at great length, Heacock compares the
lot of slaves favorably in general with the lot
of poor whites in the North, and in defense of
overseers he states that frequently the master
is the overseer, that self-interest alone dic-

 
Bunting, Sarah W. 8

 

tates concern for the physical well-being of
the slave, and that authority is sometimes nec-
essary to put down the "uproarous singing and
laughter" of the slaves or to put an end to
their quarreling and fighting among themselves.
He guestions her view of Twelve Years a Slave

 

by the freeman Solomon Northup, reminds her
that if three to four million "barbarians" were
turned loose on the Southerners through emanci-
pation that the Northerners would be out of
reach of them, says he feels the frenzy of

 
Bunting, Sarah W. 9
opposition in the North is about to burst the
Union asunder, but expresses the view that if
his niece and others in the North would make a
realistic examination of slavery the doctrine
of abolition would evaporate. He adds that he
writes more in sorrow than in anger on the sub-

 

ject of slavery.

In a letter of Nov. 12, 1855, Heacock tells
his niece that he is glad to learn that she and
a large proportion of the Society of Friends are
opposed to the rash measures adopted by the

 
Bunting, Sarah W. 10
abolitionists. He explains why her suggestion
that the Government purchase the slaves and dis-
pose of them in the way that it found to be
most expedient is an impractical suggestion.

In reply to her report that Mrs. Lucretia Mott
and other female Quaker preachers had been

 

kindly received and well treated during their
travels in the South he informs her that it was
not characteristic of Southerners to insult and
abuse strangers without good reason, "more es-
pecially females." Other matters dealt with in

Arctic region that was led by Dr. Elisha Kent
Kane, the death from illness of a valuable
young Negro man owned by his son Robert P. H.,
politics, especially the decline of the Ameri-

can Party, and the low price of cotton. The
death of Dr. Kane early in 1857 is mentioned
in Heacock's letter of Apr. 1, 1857. In re-
porting in that letter on his daughter Agatha
A. Williams and her husband, who is a cotton

 
Bunting, Sarah W. 12
commission merchant, Heacock describes briefly
the work and life style of such merchants, and
how cotton gins operate, their cost, and their
producing capacity. In his letter of October
8, 1858, he describes the harvesting of cotton
by slaves.

 

In writing on Oct. 13, 1867, Dr. John W.
Heacock reveals his own religious faith, ex-
presses his desire that the family ties with
the Northern branch of their family continue to
remain intact, comments briefly on the "oppres-

 
Bunting, Sarah W. Lo

 

Sion and tyranny" under which Southerners were
being forced to live, and states that many far-
mers in that area are so dispirited over the
difficulty of getting their farms cultivated,
exorbitant taxes, the greatly reduced price of
cotton, and the trials of using "free-Colored

labour" that they have given up farming since
they cannot even earn enough to cover the ex-
penses of their farms.

to "the Sanitariams" as a nuisance, to "nighting-

Lizzie F. Burch entered Trinity College in
1896 as a freshman. The Trinity College Bul-
letin lists her as a regular student through
her junior year, but she is listed as a special
student for 1899-1900.

 

The collection consists of themes Miss
Burch wrote as a sophomore, junior, and senior
for English courses. Three of the themes de-
scribe certain aspects of Trinity College, and
one argues that lynching is unjustifiable.

 
Burch, Lizzie F. a
Papers that appear to be articles include one
on child labor in North Carolina and one on the
moral effects of a shorter working day. For
the paper on child labor the author collected
opinions from a number of people, including
mill executives in North Carolina and educator
Charles Duncan McIver.

 

The several college notebooks of Lizzie
Burch are as follows: Five for English courses
one of which is identified as being William P.
Few's course; one is for a social science course

one for an economy course taught by Jerome Dowd;

at least one for a history course; one written

possibly two for a Latin course; and possibly

he wrote about the New School Virginia Synod of

the Presbyterian Church in the United States

Burlingame, After graduation from the
University of Michigan in 1841 and Harvard Law

School in 1846, he settled in Boston. He
married Jane Livermore in 1847, and they had
three children. In that same year he was
admitted to the Massachusetts bar. Burlingame

 
Burlingame, Anson 2
had a distinguished career in public service
including membership in the Massachusetts
Senate in 1852, in the Massachusetts Constitu-
tional Convention in 1853, and in the U.S.
House of Representatives from 1855 to 1861.
From 1861 to 1867 he served as U.S. Minister to
China and for two years following his appoint-

 

ment in 1868 was special minister to foreign
powers for the Chinese government, He died in
St. Petersburg, Russia.

The letter was written to Burlingame by

 
Burlingame, Anson 2
Hardie Hogan Helper from a prison in Salisbury,
N. C. He discussed his financial problems,

and related that he had been jailed unjustly
because of allegations that he had "been
circulating his brother's work on slavery."
This was probably a reference to Impending
Crisis of the South (1857) by Hinton Rowan
Helper.

Sir Richard Burn (1871-1947) entered the
Indian Civil Service in 1891 after completing
his education at Oxford. His official career
included the following positions: under
secretary to the government of the United

Provinces of Agra and Oudh, 1897; superinten-
dent of the census, and subsequently of the
sazetteer, 1900; editor of the Imperial Gazet-
teer of India, 1905; secretary to the govern-
ment, 1910; chief secretary, 1912; commis-
sioner, 1918; 3, oo: Board of Revenue,

 

United Provinces, 192 ; and acting

 
Burn, Sir Richard 2
finance member, 1926. He retired in 1927.

The library acquired these manuscripts with
some official documents of the United Provinces
concerning the Tenancy Acts. Several of the
oamphlets had Sir Richard Burn's name on them.
One of the letters is addressed to "Sir Richard,"
and the other concerns the Tenancy Act. The

 

Report of the Agra Tenancy Act Committee of
the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh of 192
lists Burn as a member of the committee,

On Aug. 12, 1928, Mr. Gokul Chand, the
revenue agent at Sasia, Gorakhpur, United
Provinces, explained e how several parts of

 

 

 
Burn, Sir Richard eR TEE
the Tenancv Act operated to the detriment of
the tenants, and he also discussed the education
of his grandson who was destined for govern-
ment service.

On May 17, 1935, Sir Sita Ram, President
of the Lezislative Council of the United
Provinces, wrote from Lucknow. He commented

 

on the Congress Party's majorities in the
lezislature and the position of the Speaker

who wished to take part in politics, a departure
from British parliamentary practice. He also
commented on the swearing in of the acting
rovernor; Congress > Party ministers were

 
Burn, Sir Richard 4
present for the first time at a Government

House ceremonial. Sir Sita Ram also noted

some inadequacy in the draft Tenancy Bill.
Enclosed in the letter was a clipping in which
Owen Clough, South Africa's official representa-
tive in Britain, opposed the proposal to

contest the Speaker's seat at the next general
election. He feared that the loss of continuity
in the office of Speaker in the British House of
Commons would involve that office in politics.
He discussed the history of this question in
several colonial parliaments, especially those
of South Africa with r he was familiar.

George Burrington (ca. 1680-1759) was colo-
nial governor of North Carolina during 1724-
1725 and 1731-1734.

His first administration was under the gov-
ernment of the Lords Proprietors. There is a
copy (14 pp.) of their instructions of June 3,
1723. Another set of undated instruétions

(23 pp.) appears to date from the same time;
they are Burrington's orders to enforee the
laws relating to trade and navigation. Neither

 
Burrington, George 2
of these documents is published in The Colo-
nial Records of North Carolina.

Two of Burrington's letters are addressed
to an influential friend in England, a Mr.
Knight. On July 1, 1731, the Governor discussed
former Gov. Sir Richard Everard, the Assembly
and the Council, the public's antipathy to

 

 

the systems for quit-rents and the acquisition
of land, his friends on the Board of Trade, and
his enemies, Nathaniel Rice, John Montgomery,
William Smith, and Martin Bladen. On Feb. 27,

 
Burrington, George =
1732, Burrington wrote about his conduct of the
public business, Martin Bladen, and his friends
on the Board of Trade.

Armistead Burt (1802-1882) was born of revo-
lutionary stock in Edgefield Co., S. C., studied
law in Pendleton; then moved to Abbeville Court
House which remained his residence throughout
life. In 1828 he married Martha Catherine Cal-

houn, the eldest daughter of William ("Cotton
Billy") Calhoun, brother of John C. Calhoun.
From 1843 to 1853 Burt was a member of the lower

house of the national Congress. Frevious to
e

that he had been a member of the state legisla-
ture, and of the Nullification Convention.

 
Burt, Armistead. Sketch (2)
Throughout his life Burt carried on an extensive
correspondence with prominent South Carolina
politicians. While he did not see active ser-
vice during the Civil War, Burt did perform the

w,selfish duty of managing the affairs of estate,
etc. for those who were at the "front." It is
interesting to note that the last meeting of the
Confederate cabinet was held at the home of Burt
in April, 1865. The collection is exceedingly
rich in matters political during that decade of
Crises, 1850-1860; and the period of Calhoun
onan Fp 1832-1848. Letter of Sept.4.1830 is
from the FREE TRADE eo RIGHTS PARTY,

O-5-92, Sometime in the past a number of
letters from John ©. Calhoun to Burt were trans—
ferred from this collection to the John C. Cal-
houn Papers, and several letters from Thomas
G, Clemson to Burt were added to the Thomas

G. Clemson Papers.

15 items added, 9-9-66: Letters to Burt

 

from Robert Barnwell Rhett, Alfred Moore Rhett
and Benjamin Rhett. In the letters from 1844
to 1846, R.B. Rhett discussed national and
state politics. Rhett affirmed his seces-

 
Burt, Armistead 4
Sionist position and sought Burt's support.

The letters written in 1855 and 1856 are
concerned with the settlement of John Bull's
estate, while letters dated Apr. 3, 1868 and
Feb. 4, 1869, reveal the financial difficulties
of the Charleston Mercury, edited by R.B.
Rhett, Jr., and the economic conditions pre-

 

 

vailing in the S.C. low country. Correspon-
dence of 1868, 1870, and 1871 indicates the
extent to which the Rhett family finances had

been reduced.

These items were transferred from the

19 items added, 3-24-67 (transferred from

from Thomas Green Clemson and one from Gideon
Lee, Clemson's son-in-law. Letters of 1872,

 

1873, and Oct. 17 and Nov. 24, 1878, concern
the settlement of the Calhoun estate. Burt was
Clemson's attorney and assisted him in restoring
his depleted finances. A letter of Nov. 16,

1873, notes the economic hardships experienced

 
Burt, Armistead 6
in upper South Carolina.

Wade Hampton III is the subject of several
letters. Clemson expressed his support for
Hampton in a letter dated Nev. 10, 1876. He
criticized the dishonesty pervading much of the
state's public affairs in this and several
other letters (1877-1880).

He was appointed an honorary commissioner to
represent the U.S. at the Paris Exhibition of
1878, but wrote Burt on Mar. 5, 1878, that he
could not attend unless his expenses were paid.
He also noted that he had committed himself to

 

 
Burt, Armistead
appear in court in a case involving Homer Virgil
Milton Miller, his former neighbor in Pendleton
S.-C. The date of the trial might prevent him
from attending the exhibition.

This case is again the subject of a long
letter dated Oct. 17, 1878. Clemson was
especially critical of the corruption in S.C.

 

He condemned the manipulation of public affairs
for private gain by the press and public
officials, particularly judges and the interests
of Charleston and the News and Courier.

The remaining letters refer to Clemson's

Burton, Gilbert. Biography of Sir Philip Mus-
grave, 1680. “Edenhall," County Cumberland,
England.

 

Gilbert Burton, rector of Edenhall Vicarage,
wrote a contemporary biography of Sir Philip
Musgrave (1607-1678), recounting his colorful
career in the English Civil Wars and under the
Restoration. Sir Philip, commander-in-chief of
Cumberland and Westmoreland counties, was a

staunch Royalist. He fought at Marston Moor.
The Scottish invasion of North England is noted,
together with the plundering of Musgrave estates
(they were finally sequestered) and the siege

 
Burton, Gilbert _ 2

of Carlisle. The fighting in County Cumberland
is noted; the execution of Charles I is followed
by Sir Philip's exile in France and Holland

with Charles II. Echoes of the invasion of
Scotland by Royalist forces are noted. Sir
Philip joined the Countess of Derby on the Isle
of Man, where as governor, he was beseiged at

 

Peel Castle by rebelling Manx forces. News
came of the decapitation of the Earl of Derby
after the battle of Worcester in 1651. Sir
Philip surrendered and returned to England,

where he and his son struggled to retrieve fami-
ly estates. He suffered many hardships before

 
Burton, Gilbert oe 3

the Restoration of King Charles II, when he
again became an honored leader of County Cum-
berland. An Eglanby (Aglionby) protest against
his rule is suppressed in 1668, when Sir Philip
was governor of Carlisle. Much family gene-
alogy is recounted, and many parliamentary
leaders are named. The biography was written
by the vicar of “Edenhall." Sir Philip was
evidently a patron of the church, his son
Thomas embracing a career in religion. The
manuscript was written in the late seventeenth

century, as spelling obsolete after 1700
is used in the text (1.€., "concernment, manger,
physitian," "satt in PBarlament!" "hee," etc.).

 

 
Burton, Gilbert 4

The seventeenth century manuscript was ed-
ited by Samuel Johnson (Carlisle, 1840). Its
details are substantiated by the Earl of Clar-
endon's History of the Rebellion.

Many of Sir Philip's letters are in the
Public Record Office in London, England.

The Duke University Manuscript Department has

 

 

the Aglionby-Yates Papers from Jefferson County,
Virginia, and County Cumberland, England. De-
tails of Edenhall and the Musgraves in ‘the 19th
céntury occur here. The Aglionby-Yates branch
(which came to America in the late 1700's) in-
herited the family estates in England in 1854.

The volume is a letterpress book containing
copies of the business correspondence of James
H. Burton, engineer, inventor, and farmer. He
was an engineer by profession, but took to farm-
ing after 1873 for reasons of his health. Befor
this date he was employed as chief engineer of

 

the Enfield Royal Small Arms factory in England,
where he perfected and patented (1859) a pro-
cess for the construction of steel gun barrels
by a combined method of drilling and rolling
the metal. The process waa also patented in

 
 

Burton oe wu 2
the Tntted States (1860), where James Tyler

Ames, a friend of Burton and head of the Ames
Manufacturing Co. of Chicopee, Mass., was give
a one-half interest in the patent. Burton was
later employed by two other small arms fact-

ories in England, Greenwood and Batley of Leeds

and the National Arms and Ammunition Co. of
Birmingham, Then, in Sept., 1873, Burton's
poor health forced him to leave England. He
returned to the U. S., and to his farn,
"Harwood," located near Middleburg, Va. Burto
never lost his interest in the manufacture of

 
Burton , James H,. 3
small arms, and planned to resume his career
as soon as he regained his health. However,

a suitable opportunity never seems to have
offered itself. He spent the remainéer of his

life (at least until 1894) farming and dabbling
in real estate in Va. and Ga,

 

Much of the English correspondence, 1872-
1873, as well as Burton's later letters to
friends in England, largely concerns his
attempts to secure some sort of remuneration
either from the British or American govern-
ments, or from private manufacturers in Eng-

 
Burton, James H 4
land and the U. S., for their use of his pro-
gcess of manufacturing steel gun barrels. This

SAprocess, which 1s described by Burton in a

A letter of Aug. 6, 1873, was adaptable only to
breech-loading rifles, which came to be used
extensively only after 1871. But by this date

 

Burton's English patent had been allowed to
expire, while in 1873 the U. S. government
refused him an extension of his patent on the
grounds of "want of novelty." Meanwhile, his
process was being used by the companies for
which he worked in England, and in the U, 8S,

 
 

Burton ames H. 5
it was adopted by Remington & Sons (Spring-
field, Mass,), the Providence Tool Co., and
the U, 8S. Government Armory at Springfield.
Burton, as his letters show, became quite
bitter over the whole matter. He was able
finally to obtain some satisfaction from the

National Arms & Ammunition Co. (cf. letters
of Aug. 11, 1873 & Jan. 9, 1877), but in spite
of petitions to his sgnator and to one of the
members of the House of Representatives for
Va. (Mar. 13, 1876), hts efforts to receive
some small payment for the benefits of his

 
Burton, James H, 6
process to American manufacturers were un-
successful.

Burton's letters from England contain
interesting observations regarding labor con-
ditions in that country during 1872-73, which
he described as highly favorable to labor

 

(cf. letters of Apr. 22, 1872 & Feb. 24, 1873).
In addition, in many of Burton's letters there
is occasional reference made to the business
affairs of various armaments companies, both
in England and the U. S.: Remington & Sons,
and their use of his process (Aug. 1, 1872 &

 
 

Burton, James H, 7
Mar. 25, 1873); the Winchester Repeating Arms

Co., and its contract with the Turkish govern-
ment in 1872 for 200,000 Martini-Henry rifles
(Aug. 5, 1872); the contract of Greenwood &
Batley (Leeds, England) in 1872 with the
Russian government to supply the machinery and

tools for a small arms factory at Tula (Aug.
31, 1876); the National Arms & Ammunition
Company's contract with the Prussian govern-
ment in 1872 for new breech-loading rifles
and ammunition; the Providence Tool Company's
contract with the Turkish government for

 
Burton, James H, 8
800,000 Martini-Henry rifles (Feb. 16, 1876).
Burton also corresponded from England with ©
James Tyler Ames in Chicopee, Mass., regarding
their common interest in his process; and late
in 1875, Burton was employed for a short period
by the Ames Manufacturing Co. (cf. letter of

 

Dec. 23, 1874). In 1874, Burton's two sons
worked for the Winchester Repeating Arms Co.,
New Haven, Conn., one as a machinist and the
other as a draftsman,

The bulk of the material after Sept.,
1873, deals with Burton's farm business -

 
Burton, James H, 9
orders for supplies, receipts, sales of stock
and produce, etc, -; and there are numerous
letters concerning either the sale or pur-
Chase of farm land and real estate in Va.,

W. Va., and Ga. Burton sold his original
farm, "Harwood," in Feb., 1878. For a

 

time he contemplated moving to Ga. - he owned
land near Macon - and setting up in the cotton
seed o11 business. Farming in Va., he noted
in 1879, was no longer profitable because of
increasing competition from grain fields in
the western U. 8S. (Dec. 11, 1878; Jan. 4, 1879

 
Burton, James H, 10
instead, however, Burton purchased farm land
in W. Va.; and two years later, in 1880, he
sold this land and returned to farming in
Va., first at Kernstown, then at Winchester.
Burton never resumed his profession as an
engineer,

was ordained as a deacon in the Virginia Confer-
ence in 1833 and as an elder in 1837. Burton
served Methodism from 1833 until his retirement
in 1889, His appointments were in both Virginia
and North Carolina and included several terms

of trying to supplant Burton as presiding elder
of the Petersburg District, and praised Burton
as a preacher and administrator.

On Jan. 15, 1863, Dr. Thomas Palmer Jerman,
a member of the Methodist church at Ridgeway in

 

Warren County, N.C., asked Burton to preach reg-
ularly for the church and discussed some of its
problems and activities.

there are many from her childre to one

of letters reflecting the social life of an

Benjamin F. Butler(1818-1893) was the son of
Capt. John “utler, who served with Jackson at KM
New Orleans, After graduating from Waterville
(now Colby University), he began pracitcing law
at Lowell, Mass. where he established a high

reputation as a criminal lawyer. Entering pol-
itics as a democrat in 1853, he served in the
Mass. legisleture tintil 1859. He represented his

state at the Charleston and the Baltimore

conventions in 1860, withdrawing from the lat-
ter when African slave trade was “approvingly
advocated". He answered Lincoln's call for troo
and in May, 1861, was placed in command at Fort-
ress Monroe, Va. While here he refused to retur
some slaves that came within his lines, saying

that they were contraband of War. With Farragut

Fisher in 1864 caused Grant to remove Butler
from his command.

After the war Buller was a member of Congress
until 1879 and took an active part in the im-
peachment of President Johnson. In 1882 a wing
of the democrats united with the republican
and Butler was elected governor, after several
unsuccessful campaigns.

The collection is small. One etter shows

Negro. The other 18 an invitation to a memorial

Iberville, La. 14@ pieces 1888.
In 1748 Thomas and Eleanor(Parker)Butier left
Kilkenny, Ireland to settle in Carlisle, Penn.
where two of their seven children were born. The
five sons, Richard, William, Thomas, Percival,
and Edward, proved illustrious soldiers in the
Revolution. Edward later moved to Bennessee and

 

it was there that his son, Edward George Washing
ton Butler, was born in 1800. The death of his
father in 1803 left the young Edward to the care

of Andrew Jackson, who evidently entertained a

 
Butler, Edward Geo. Washington (2)

warm affection for his ward. E.G.W.Butler grad-
uated from West Poing in 1820 and remained in
the army until 1831, serving on the staff of
Edmund Pendleton Gaines for seven years as senidq
aide-de-camp. About 1825 Butler married Frances
Parke, daughter of Eleanor Parke (Custis) and
Lawrence Lewis of Woodlawn, Va.(see Lewis, Law-
rence MSS., Duke University Library). Butler
resigned from the army in 1831 to engage in
sugar and cotton cultivation in Louisiana and

 

 
Butler, Edward Geo. Washington (3)
Mississippi, where he remained until his death
in 1888. Except for a short time when Butler
re-entered the army as colonel of the dragpons
and served in the Mexican War, he does not seemm
to have entered public life, although the cor-
respondence shows he was tremendously interested
in national and state affairs. Butler had sev-

 

eral children:Laurence Lewis,served in the n-
federate Army and later moved to St.Louis;Edward
was killed in battle in 1861; Isabel married

George Williamson. There were probably two other

 
Butler, Edward Geo. Washington (4)

children, Caro and William, although it is im-
possible to determine this from the correspond-
ence.

The collection is of considerable imporf&iance.
The family connections were imprtant and there
are several letters from Andrew Jackson, Robert
E. Lee, and Jefferson Davis on personal and fami

 

ly matters. Letters from James Buchanan, Edmund

Gaines, Braxton Bragg, and James Slidell shed

much light on the building of railroads, economig

problems of slavery,annexation of Texas, the Mexi

can War,the Kansas-Nebraska question,Lincoln's

election,the Civil “oe of norte
tion

 
Butler, Edward “George Washington. (5)
and other matters of national importance. The

letters of Alexander Duncan,of Duncan,Sherman &
Co.,cotton factors of N.Y.C.,who spent much time
in Eng.,contain many interesting and valuable
comments on American and European affairs. The
collection is valuable because it covers a long
period (1821-1888) ,because of the contents, and
because of the persons involved.

most of that year he was with Gen. Gaines on a
inspection trip in Ga. Part of the time they

were at Broken Arrow and the Creek Agency mak-
ing an investigation of Indian affairs. In

addition to expressing his sentiments toward
Miss Lewis, he says he hopes John Q. Adams did
not connive at the disgraceful coalition which
raised him to the presiidency, mentions the
evidence that is being uncovered of the corrupt
negotiations on the part of white men with the
Creeks which led to the Treaty of Indian Spr-

Butler wrote from New Orleans in 1831 to
his wife Frances about the possibility of buy-
ing some slaves. In May 1832 Mrs. Lewis wrote
her daughter Mrs. Butler an informative letter
in which she mentioned the artist John Gadsby
Chapman and George Poindexter.

There are letters from Lawrence Lewis to
Butler about his financial difficulties. By
1843 the Butlers were living at "Dunboyne, "
La. During that year he wrote to Chas. M.
Conrad, who was seeking reelection to the U.S.

attack on Andrew Jackson. Mrs. Butler wrote
in 1847 about reports she had heard on the
Mexican War and her attitude toward Pres. Polk.
There is a letter written from Washington in
1850 which mentions the debate on the Compro-
mise of 1850, the rejection of Soulé's amend-

 

ment, American intervention in Cuba, and a
bill Senator Thos. J. Rusk of Texas had intro-
duced for the expansion of the army for the

Isaac O. Sutler died at Loda, Illinois in
1857 and there is a mass of material relating

to the settlement of his estate for which Lela-
nd W. Butler was executor. Issac's oldest son,
Thomas, carried on a long and interesting
correspondence with his uncle, Leland, until

the latters death in 1883. Thomas sold
agricultural tools and implements and evidently
did a good business. Periodically he would
write his uncle that he was moving to Iowa or
Colorado, but family obligations always pre-

vented this. His letters throw some side

light on economic conditions from 1860-to 1883.
Patrick H. Butler moved to New York and

worked for vgrious mercantile establishments.

He was unsuccessful in every business <iventare
and wrote numerous letters to his father and
brother, asking for money and assistance of one
kind and another. His wife inherited a large
farm in Amelia county from her father. Patrick

never succeeded in raising sufficient funds to
equip the farm and it was not a success in any
sense. After Patrick's death in 1876, his
daughters and sons took up his requests for

assistance. One son moved to Iowa, and Nannie
married a Methodist preacher, William E. Payne.
Leland W. Butler was the only one of the

fambly who ever attained any degree of financial
success. He established himself at Hewletts as
a tobacco farmer and seems to have branched out

 

into other businesses: His success made hi
less fortunate relatives request, and at times

almost demand, monetary assistance. Leland's

daughter was educated at W. T. Chandler's
school at Bowling Green, his son Austin at
Blenheim, Albemarle county, and Issac at
Randolph Macon. The Butlers were Methodists
and consitent subscribers to the Richmond

 

Christian Advocate. There are some papers
relating to a quarrel between Hillary McCland-
ish and Jd. T. MSumpass of the Western Hanover
Circuit. There is no indication that the

Butlers were interested in politics although it

seems that Leland was a "readjuster" in 1881
The collection is large. It contains a
great deal about the Butler family and sheds
some interesting side lights on social and
economic conditions in Illionois and in Virginia

 

The accounts of Issac and ~eland W. Butler
are perhaps the most valuable part of the
collection as they cower a long period of time
and show what was bought and the prices of

various commodities.

This collection, consisting largely
of letters to Louisa Butler from her
brothers, Dr. R. S., Altamount T. and
Thomas C,, falls chiefly in the Civil
War period. All of the brothers served
in the Confederate Army; Thomas C. died

in the hospital of Camp Winder at Rich-

 
Butler, Louisa Sketch (2)

 

mond May 7, 1862. Altamount R. survived
the war as did R. S., although the lat-
ter died, evidently from exposure during
the war, in 1874. R. 3. Butler was a
physician, who before and after the War
lived at Palatka, Florida. Louisa Butler
with her sister, Clarinda, lived with
their mother at Gone Mountain, Ga., for
the most of the period covered bv this
correspondence. At the outset of the

correspondence, however, they lived at

Lawrenceville, Georgia, but soon after
the war they moved to Atlanta.

 

In addition to revealing conditions
in the army and civilian life during the
Confederate period, the letters reveal

poverty. It seems that Louisa and Clarin-
da Butler lived with their mother and de-
pended on small sums of money sent by
their brothers. R. S. Butler's letters
