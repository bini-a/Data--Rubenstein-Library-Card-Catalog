William Smith, M. P. (1766-1835) was an
important figure in English politics for about
50 years. He was interested in many reform
measures, This collection’240 items is con-
cerned primarily with his’ activities relative

to the abolition of West Indian slevery, al-
though there are a few items outside of this
area,

Among the 100 letters in this collection

there are many of considerable interest and
importance. Outstanding are the 24 letters of
William Wilberforce (1759-1833); these discuss
such topics as: religion, sickness in the family
his sickness which forced him to leave the House
of Commons, his family and his desire for more
private life with them, his relatives, political

 

disappointments, trips and engagements, publishes
ers, criminals in Great Britain and their pun-
ishment, resolutions and plans for the abolit-
ion of slavery,the anti-slavery society, the

and approving Smith's actions; some of them
mention Wilberforce, also. A letter from J.
Yule in Edinburgh of August 13, 1792 tells of
the poor Scottish peasants who are being driven
from their lands to make foom for sheep which
are more profitable. Three letters from James
Muir betweenl793 and 1797 discuss the case of
his som who has been banished for fourteen years
for joining the Society for Parliamentary Re-
form. Alletter from John Longley on January 31,
1796 tells of a book which he has just published

on parliamentary reform and discusses various
aspects of the English government from the view-
point of a reformer. Thomas Coke on March 16,
1809 writes of the different slavery laws in
Jamaica. A lengthy letter from Andrew Wedder-
burn, a large Jamaica plantation owner, on Nov-
ember 12, 1813 discusses the condition of the

Negroes after a storm, their food supplies,
sickness and death, his attitude toward their
care, the various uses of the land, the crops
raised, the market for produce, the purchase

 
Smith, Willian. Papers. Sketch. 6
and hiring of slaves, and shinments to England.
A number of letters from Bermuda, Nevis, St.
Vincent, Barbados, and Berbice contain similar
discussions. An unusually good letter comes from
a planter in St. Vincent, April 4, 1816. Some
of these planters! letters give in rather em-
phatic terms the case of the planters against
the abolition of slavery. There is a copy of a
sermon preached at Port Royal, Jamaica, June 7,
1822 on the anniversary of the great earthquake
(1692) which comtains a very frank and open

 

 
Smith, Willian. Papers. Sketch, =e
criticism of the moral life of Port Royal.

One of the most interesting items in the col-
lection is a letter from John Horseman, July 15,
1817, which includes the text of Robert Southeys
poem entitled "To the Exiled Patriots." The orfly
known publication of the poem ig in Samuel
Taylor Coleridge's, Essays on His Own Times,
(1850) I, 19-20. Horseman's edition of the poem
contains sixteen stanzas ag compared to Cole-
ridge's ten. In addition eight of the lines
are different in the two editions.

 

 

 
Smith, Willian. Papers. Sketch, 8
several letters from Thomas Clarkson in 1825-
18°7 discuss the methods to be used in the drive
for complete abolition of slavery. A letter
from T. Gisborne in 1829 accuses Smith of being
a Papist. A lengthy pefition in 1829 signed by
95 "principal native inhabitants" of Bombay,
India, protests to the House of Commons against
certain grievances and asks redress. A letter
of Gilbert Salton in Bermuda in 1832 comments
with keen insight on the recent Reform Act, on
Irish indepvendence, andon the types of Christian

missionaries in the West Indies; later letters
from him give considerable details regarding the
ourchase of a@ life insurance policy in England.
Different letters in 1833 tell of the methods
and problems involved in the abolition of slav-
ery. A letter from James Stephen announces Wil-
berforce's death, July 29, 1833; also a letter
from Wilberforceé's son, Robert, tells of the
death. There is a copy of a petition to Rev.

H. W. Wilberforce signed by 127 members of both
houses of Parliament requesting that William

 

 
Smith, William. Papers, Sketch. LO
Wilberforce be buried in Westminioster Abbey and
that they be granted permission to attend the
funeral, Several letters between the Clarksons
and William Smith shortly after Wilberforce's
death concern Robert Wilberforce's proposed life
of his father and his ideas of attacking some of
Thomas Clarkson's claims for himself in the ab-

 

olition movement.

5 items added, 1-12-61. This addition
consists of two leaflets from the Greek Com-
mittee in London and of three letters which are
addressed to William Smith - two from Prince
Alexander Mavrocordato, an official in the
revolutionary Greek government, and one from
John Orlando, a Greek Deputy. On June 24, 1823,
Mavrocordato asks Smith's support for a mission
which the Greeks are sending to England. The
Greek emissaries hope to obtain a loan, as well
as publicity, for their cause. Mavyorcordato

 

 
Smith, Willian, 16
also expresses (July 4, 1823) to Smith the
appreciation of the Greek government for his
efforts in its behalf. Orlando thanks (July
15, 1826) Smith for his help, and he refers to
an unspecified decision which is expected from
George Canning (7). There are two leaflets
from the Greek Committee of which Smith was a

 

member. One leaflet (4 pp. ) contains an address
in behalf of the Greek revolutionary cause (May
3, 1823), a list of the members of the Greek
Committee, and a list of seven resolutions which
were adopted at a public meeting on May 15, 182

William Alexander Smith (1843-1934), capital-
ist, operated business enterprises in Anson
County and its vicinity and invested in a
considerable number and variety of businesses
in North Carolina and other states. His
initial fortune came from a mercantile store
during 1866-1886, Thereafter until the begin-
ning of the 1900's, he was a cotton textile
manufacturer. From the early years of his

 
Smith, William Alexander 2
business activity until the 1930's, he was an
investor and maintained an office at Ansonville
where he styled himself variously as a banker,
broker, capitalist, and purchasing agent. His
investments were valued at $180,000 in 1933.
They included automobiles, banking, commercial
finance, cosmetics, furniture, insurance,

 

lumbering, patent medicine, personal loans,
railway cars, real estate development, the
textile industry, tobacco processing, and the
mining of gold, copper, and mica, The papers

 
Smith, William Alexander 7
include correspondence, reports, and financial
Statements. He also owned and operated a
substantial farm. Major interests were educa-
tion, the Episcopal Church, and the United
Confederate Veterans. Information about state
politics is scarce and scattered. A biographi-
cal sketch of Smith appears in Samuel A. Ashe,
Biographical History of North Carolina (Greens-
boro, N. C., 1905-1917), VI, 434-442, Consi-
derable information is in Smith's Family Tree

Cotton textile manufacturing was a continuing
topic of the papers from the 1880's to the early
1930's. It is represented by Smith's manage-
ment of the Yadkin Falls Manufacturing Company
and the Eldorado Cotton Mills from the mid-
1880's into the first decade of the 1900's and
thereafter by information about his investments

 

in various textile mills, mostly in North
Carolina.

After his success in the mercantile business,
Smith moved into cotton textile manufacturing.

 
Smith, William Alexander 7
He was the president of the Yadkin Falls Manu-
facturing Company and of the Eldorado Cotton
Mills that had their factories at Milledgeville
in Montgomery County. Yadkin Falls was incor-
porated in 1883 and continued until it went into
receivership in about 1896 (noted in letter of
Jan. 7, 1897). References begin in 1883 and
are numerous in the later 1890's. Volumes

from the mill include a Letter Book, 1887-1888.
An Account Book, 1876-1887, contains a variety
of records among which are the expenses for

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 8

 

the construction of Yadkin Falls's factory,
1883-1884 (pp. 100-103, 138-143), and an inven-
tory of mercantile goods purchased by the com-
pany from John* Snotherly (pp. 156-157).

Smith's Letterpress Book, 1867-1890, includes
company correspondence in at least 1886. A
contemporary map of the mill appears in Trinit
College and Mills of Randolph, Guilford, Mont-
gomery, and Davidson Co.'s, N. Carolina (New
York, 1889). ~

 

 

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 9
Eldorado Cotton Mills was organized in 1897,
and correspondence and reports on its operations
are very numerous through 1902 and scattered
thereafter until 1906. A number of volumes
belonged to the company: Letter Book, 1899-190
Time Book, 1898-1903; General Store Ledger,
1900-1903; and bank, check, dividend check, and
deposit books, 1898-1902.
Eldorado supplied goods to the Tucker &
Carter Rope Company of New York that operated
a factory at New London in nearby Stanly

 

 
Smith, William Alexander LO
County. Correspondence with this firm was
heavy during 1898-1902, and a legal and finan-
cial controversy occupied much attention in
1914-1919. In 1905 Smith withdrew from textile
management when the Eldorado factory was sold
to Tucker & Carter (letters of Jan. 27, 28).
Two prominent individuals associated with
Smith at this time were Francis Johnstone
Murdoch and Lee Slater Overman, Murdoch, an
Episcopal clergyman at Salisbury, was also
a textile executive. He organized the Salisbury

 

 
Smith, William Alexander ck
Cotton Mills and the Rowan Knitting Company

and was a president of Yadkin Falls. There are
more than fifty letters, 1890-1920, from Mur-
doch, mostly during 1890-1898, and numerous
references to both his textile and ecclesiasti-
cal work. Overman, who became a U. S. senator
in 1903, was involved with Eldorado, and his

 

seventeen letters date during 1897-1900.
References to him also appear at this time.
Smith was a friend of James William Cannon

and an investor in his textile mills, and there

ences to him, to Cannon Mills, and to the other
companies that he operated, such as Wiscassett
Mills, Cabarrus Cotton Mills, and Amazon Cotton
Mills.

omith invested in a number of textile mills,
mostly in North Carolina and at least one in
South Carolina. Some are included in a list
of his stocks on Feb, 17, 1925. Statements
from his guardians in the 1920's-1930's list
the investments; they are filed among the

 

 
omith, William Alexander 13
Legal Papers. References in the papers include
financial statements as well as correspondence,
Durham Hosiery Mills and the Lillian Knitting
Mills (Albemarle) were noted with some fre- ©
quency, especially in the 1920's. Other mills
about which there are one or more references
include (see the Subject Catalog for dates):
The Charlotte Handkerchief Knitting Co.;

Corley Mills, Inc. (Greenville, S. C.); Cum-
berland Plush Mills, Inc.; Eastern Manufacturing
Co.; Great Falls Manufacturing Co.; Holt-

Carolina and Massachusetts were discussed dur-
ing 1900-1903 when Bennett Dunlap Nelme, Smith's
adopted son, attended them. The textile indus-

* He changed his name from William Bennett

try in Rhode Island was noted a few times.

Real estate was another of Smith's financial
interests. He was a stockholder in The
Stephens Company that developed Myers Park,
an exclusive residential area in Charlotte,
and there are many references to that endeavor
and others during 1911-1925. He was president
of the Carolina Construction Company, but the
references to it are not numerous (1904-1908).

George Stephens, director and president
of The Stephens Company, was also president and

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 16
vice president of the American Trust Company of
Charlotte of which Smith was also a stockholder.
The bank handled transactions for Smith, and
there is a very extensive series of letters

from Stephens during 1910-1924 in which banking,
real estate, and other investments were dis-
cussed. There are also a considerable number

 

of routine business letters from Paul Cameron
Whitlock and Word Harris Wood who were also
officials of the American Trust. References to
banking in North Carolina are numerous from

 
Smith, William Alexander Bs
1893 into the early 1930's. In the 1890's the
Wadesboro branch of the Bank of New Hanover
failed, and Smith sued it. Several banks appear
in his lists of stockholdings (Feb. 17, 1925,
and legal papers, 1920's-1930's). The First
National Trust Company at Durham helped Smith
with investments during 1922-1924, He was a
stockholder of the Pee Dee Trust Co. of Florence
S. C., for which there are references in 1909-
1913. Correspondence was extensive with the
National Securities Company of Greensboro

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 18
during 1923-1925.

Commercial finance figured prominently in
the papers in 1922-1925, for Smith had invested
$10,500 in the Southern States Finance Company
of Charlotte. This firm was absorbed by Hare
& Chase, Inc., of Philadelphia in 1925.

The mining industry--gold, copper, and mica--
is extensively represented in the papers.
Smith joined with a relative and other business-
men in Georgia and Alabama in mining investment.
Material on the Eagle River Mining Company

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 19
(gold) in Alaska abounds during 1905-1916.
The Montana Consolidated Gold Mining Company
also appears in many manuscripts of 1905-1918.
The Monarch Mining and Smelting Company (copper)
at Wickenburg, Arizona, received considerable
attention during 1906-1918. Smith also invested
in the Spruce Pine Mica Company, Inc., that had
a factory at Spruce Pine, N. C., and there are
papers about it (1924-1933).

Insurance companies appear in the papers
during 1906-1920, for Smith was a stockholder

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 20
of two Greensboro firms - the North State Fire
Insurance Company and the Dixie Fire Insurance
Company...

Transportation investments included both the
railroad and automobile industries. The
Edwards Railway Motor Car Company of Sanford,
N. C., produced a gasoline powered passenger

 

car (papers of 1923-1925 and 1927). There are
numerous references, 1922-1932, to the David
Buick Carburetor Corporation (absorbed by the
Dunbar Carburetor Corporation). Information of

 
Smith, William Alexander 2
1922-1923 appears on the Fox Motor Car Company,
manufacturer of an automobile with an air-cooled
engine. Construction of the Winston-Salem
Southbound Railway through Ansonville was noted
in 1910-1911.

The papers include material on a variety of
other manufacturing concerns in which Smith
invested in the 1920's: the Carolina Remedies
Company of Union, S. C., producers of shampoo
and other items, that was absorbed by Caroco
Laboratories, Inc., of Washington, D. C. (ex-

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 22
tensive papers, 1922-1925); the W. L. Hand
Medicine Co. of Charlotte (1923-1925); the John
E. Hughes Co., Inc., of Danville, Va., a
tobacco processor (1922-1924); and the Forsyth
Furniture Lines, Inc. (1922-1923).

Electric power production was new to the
state when Smith negotiated during 1901-1903
with persons who were interested in the water
power at his mill site. In 1901 he and others
incorporated the Yadkin Falls Electric Co.

(Legal Papers).

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 23

There are about a dozen references to the
lumber industry in North Carolina, 1916-1925.
Among the volumes are the Steam Mill Account
Books, 1851-1861, of Smith & Ingram who operated
a sawmill in Anson County. Letters of 1850-
1851 concern the acquisition of steam machinery
to run the sawmill.

 

Three publishers appear in the papers. The
Stone Publishing Co. of Charlotte printed
Smith's history of the Anson Guards in 1914
about which there was considerable correspon-

 
Smith, William Alexander __ 24
dence, Benjamin Franklin Johnson, a Washington
publisher, included a biographical sketch of
Smith in his Makers of :America about which
there was correspondence in 1915-1916. Charles
L. Van Hoppen of Greensboro printed Samuel
A'Court Ashe's Biographical History of North
Carolina that was noted during 1905- 1911. There
are several letters from Ashe on historical
and other matters. He wrote the sketch of
Smith in the Biographical History.

Smith owned the family farm of 1500 acres

on the Pee Dee River, and his reputation in
agriculture was sufficient for the state to
appoint him a delegate to the Farmer's National
Congress at Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Agree-
ments with tenant farmers are scattered through
the legal papers, 1903-1932, and the corres-
pondence, account books, and bills and receipts
may include related material. These records
also contain information on the cotton trade -
prices, condition of the crops, selling routes,
etc. A. Sydney Smith & Son of Charleston was

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 26
a cotton factor with whom Smith often dealt in
the 1890's. At that time cotton factorage was
a declining or expiring business as Smith
reported. The correspondence does not become
numerous until the 1880's and 1890's, and
earlier agricultural transactions are recorded
among the legal and financial papers that were

 

grouped together under the estates of relatives
that Smith administered. They included his
father, William Gaston Smith (1802-1879), his
grandfather, John Smith (1772-1854), the

 
Smith, William Alexander aS
latter's wife, Mary (Bellew) Smith (1775-1872),
and others. Records of cotton sales and lists
of slaves appear in these papers. The estate
papers are grouped together but are not arranged
chronologically because of their number, varied
Sizes, and lesser utility. The Letterpress
Book, 1867-1890, has many letters about the
settlement of W. G. Smith's estate.

The volumes add to the picture of the
agricultural economy of Anson County. Account
pooks of blacksmiths, 1840-1857, belonged to

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 28
James B, Lindsey, Lindsey & Morton, Elliott
& Tyson, Eligah W. Elliott, and possibly Charles
Ebenezer Smith. Grist mill operations appear
in two account books of John Smith (1835-1858)
and of William G. Smith's Grassy Island Mill
(1860-1864). The papers also include material
on the Norwood Milling Company (Norwood, N. C.)
in 1906-1908,

Two generations of the family engaged in
mercantile business, William G. Smith's ledger
dates from 1835-1845. His brother, Joseph

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 29
Pearson Smith, operated on a larger scale with
stores at both Wadesboro and Ansonville for
which there are account books from the 1840's
and 1850's. At Wadesboro he also sold and
repaired buggies and carriages according to his
advertisement in the North Carolina Argus

(Apr. 7, 1859, p. 3). His Ledger, 1858, records
Sales and repairs, and it appears to be differ.
ent and separate from the Ledger, 1855-1858,
that is cataloged for Eli Freeman, a carriage
repairman, who advertised at the same time.

 

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 30
William A. Smith began his fortune by opening
a store in 1866. His cashbook, 1875-1902,
includes store accounts until its sale in 1886.
A Purchases Journal, 1875-1877, lists various
elements of cost, such as freight, insurance,
discounts, etc. He was a partner of Charles A.
Smith (not a relative) in running a store in
1887-1889; the store failed, Charles A. Smith
left the state, and W. A. Smith had to pick up
the pieces, according to his Letterpress Book,
1889-1895. A ledger, invoice book, and inven-

 

 
Smith, William Alexander BPO
tory (includes a financial report) survive from
this business.

He maintained an office at Ansonville in
which he conducted his financial operations.
Letterheads described him variously as banker
and purchasing agent (1894), capitalist and
broker (1898), general purchasing agent and

 

supplier (1905), and general purchasing agent
(1915). Four ledgers (1875-1933), a daybook
(1885-1893), and letter and letterpress books
(1867-1895, 1909-1910) and a box of many small

 
Smith, William Alexander ae
account books represent his dealings. His
position as a source of loans for the community
is neatly summarized in the Inventory of Notes
and Accounts Receivable that has alphabetical
lists for 1886 and 1890. By 1926 Smith was
under the legal guardianship of his wife and
adopted son whose reports of the 1920's and
1930's list his investments that were estimated
as worth $180,000 in 1933. A small Stock
Dividend Ledger, 1931-1934, records investment

income,

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 33
The legal papers include numerous deeds,
plats, etc., that, unlike the correspondence,
are abundant for the decades before the Civil
War and begin in the late 1700's,
The following paragraphs concern politics
and Smith's interests in Civil War history,
the United Confederate Veterans, education,

 

the Episcopal Church, the Freemasons, and medi-
cinal spring resorts.

Smith was not professionally active in
politics, but he had political connections

 
Smith, William Alexander 34
because of his prominence in the community.
There are scattered letters on elections in
North Carolina, 1890-1920, especially the Demo-
cratic primary of 1912 in which Walter Clark
campaigned unsuccessfully. Courts, the Demo-
cratic Party, and county government in the
state were noted in a few instances. Smith

 

participated in the good roads movement that is
represented by scattered manuscripts of 1906-
1927, especially 1916. He was a first cousin
of Mary (Mollie) Ann (Nelme) Crump, mother of

 
Smith, William Alexander 35
Edward Hull Crump ("Boss Crump" of Memphis,
Tennessee), and there are several letters from
them and about the family and Crump's political
career, Biographical and genealogical infor-
mation about him is in Smith's Family Tree
Book, Genealogical and Biographical...
(Los Angeles, 1922). Other relatives lived in
northern Mississippi and in Memphis and Shelby
County, Tennessee, and there was some comment
on politics there between 1881 and 1911.

The Civil War material is retrospective

 

 

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 36
rather than contemporary. Smith served with

the Anson Guards from 1861 until he was serious-
ly wounded at Malvern Hill on July 1, 1862.

He wrote a history entitled The Anson Guards,
Company C, Fourteenth Regiment, North Carolina
Volunteers, 1861-1865 (Charlotte, N. C., 1914).
There was considerable correspondence about

 

 

 

 

this work during 1911-1915. Several reminis-
cences are filed among the writings. John J.
McLendon, a sharpshooter, described events from
the Seven Days before Richmond in 1862 until

 
Smith, William Alexander 37
the end of 1863. There are many letters from
McLendon at the time when he was planning to
write the regimental history. Thomas J. Wat-
kins's narrative of July, 1864, to April, 1865,
was based on his diary and recorded the regi-
ment's activity under General Early.when it
returned from the raid on Washington to campaign

 

in the lower Shenandoah Valley. William Carr
Power, a Methodist minister, was chaplain of

the Guards. An incomplete manuscript contains
his reminiscences. He was also the author of

 
Smith, William Alexander 38
an autobiographical sketch and of a biographical
sketch of Col. Risden Tyler Bennett. Edmund F.
Fenton wrote about Malvern Hill, Extracts of
April 1-13, 1865, from the diary of Giles
Buckner Cooke of General Lee's staff chronicled
the retreat to Appomattox (enclosed in his let-
ter of Sept. 21, 1923). Causes and historio-
graphy of the war were discussed in the 1920's
and 1930's by Samyel A'Court Ashe and others.
The designing of the Confederate flag and the
raising of the first flag of secession in North

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 39
Carolina at Ansonville (about which Smith pub-
lished a pamphlet) were also subjects of corres-
pondence in these years. Secession was noted

in 1915-1917. Smith was a prominent member

and official of the United Confederate Veterans,
and its correspondence is scattered through

the papers from 1898, sometimes in abundance...
He was commander of the N. C, Division, U. C. V.
in the early 1920's. There is occasional mater-
ial from the United Daughters of the Confed-

eracy.

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 40
Education was a concern of both Smith and
his father who contributed their time and money
to various institutions, William Gaston Smith

was chairman of the Board of Trustees of the
Carolina Female College at Ansonville (char-
tered, 1850) about which there is considerable
information in letters, bills and receipts,

 

ledgers, and writings. W. A. Smith published
a pamphlet entitled Old Carolina College.
During 1906-1910 he sponsored Nona Institute
at Ansonville that was oriented toward the

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 41
Episcopal Church. He was a trustee of the
University of the South at Sewanee that appear-
ed in the manuscripts from 1892 to 1920. His
studies at Davidson College were interrupted
by the Civil War. There are scattered letters
about the school, 1880-1932. Bennett Dunkap

 

Nelme, his adopted son, was educatéd at textile
schools and mills, and there was comment about
New Bedford and Lowell Textile schools in Mass-
achusetts (1902-1907) and about North Carolina

Sate College

 
Smith, William Alexander 42
(1900-1903). There were various references to
the public school system in the state, Contro-
versy over the content of history textbooks
occurred in 1921. A number of academies and
colleges appeared in the papers, usually because
of connections with students or faculty:
Albemarle Normal and Industrial Institute,

 

Charlotte Female Institute, Lilesville Insti-
tute, Pee Dee Academy, Pocket Academy, St.
Mary's, Salem Female Academy, Salisbury Normal
and Industrial Institute, Selma Academy, and

 
Smith, William Alexander 43
Southern Industrial Institute, all in North
Carolina; others were Pittsburg Academy in
Texas and a school at Uniontown, Kentucky.

The church was another foremost interest of
the Smiths. William Gaston Smith was architect
of the Methodist church at Ansonville, and
there is a contract of Nov., 1842, for its

 

construction (Legal Papers). William Carr
Power's reminiscences (filed among the writings)
are those of a Methodist minister as a chaplain
in the Civil War. W. A. Smith was a prominent

 
Smith, William Alexander 4d
layman of the Episcopal Church and the patron
of All Soul's Church at Ansonville. He was a
friend of Bishop Joseph Blount Cheshire from
whom there are more than 120 letters of 1892-
1931. Another such friend was Archdeacon
Edwin A. Osborne whose letters of 1887-1920
number seventy. Smith regularly attended the
diocesan conventions and was a member of the
Executive Missionary Committee. Mission work,
local churches and ministers, and general
references to diocesan affairs appear in the

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 45
papers from 1880 to 1928 and also in the file
of writings. He was a member of the Board of
Managers of the Thompson Orphanage from its
inception, and there are references during
1887-1927. He was a lay delegate to the Pan
Anglican Congress at London in 1908, but there
is little information about it. At this time

 

he became a friend of William James, an employee
on the estates of the Earl of Carlisle.

Letters from James and his wife continue into
the 1930's and include references to the

 
Smith, William Alexander 46
family of Lord Carlisle.

W. A. Smith was a Freemason, and his wri-
tings include an undated history of Carolina
Lodge, No. 141, of Ansonville. A volume con-
tains the lodge's minutes of 1906-1925.

His health was bad at times, and he visited
medicinal springs in the decades after 1890.
Those described in letters of Smith and others
were: Cleveland Springs, Lincoln Lithia Spring,
Moore's Springs, and Rocky River Springs in
N. C.; a spring at Troy, S. C.; Hampton Springs,

 

 
Smith, William Alexander 47
Florida; Tate Spring in Tennessee; and Crockett
Arsenic-Lithia Springs in Virginia. Consult
the Subject File for specific dates.

A small diary and notebook (19 pp.) 1765=
1789, of James Auld is filed among the writings.
He was probably a family connection, for the
name of Auld appears occasionally in the Smith

 

genealogy. Auld moved from Dorchester County,
Maryland, to Halifax, N. C., in 1765, farmed,
ran a store for Joseph Montfort, and was clerk
of the court. In 1771 he became clerk of the

 
Smith, William Alexander 48
court in Anson County. The diary records these
years, includes accounts of 1766 for legal
work at Halifax (some of it for Montfort), and
contains family names and dates. Auld's first
name was identified by references in The Colo-
nial Records of North Carolina.

There are folders of genealogy, mostly notes
collected for the work on the Family Tree
Book, Prior to its publication in 1922 the
correspondence contains much family data.

The pictures include Smith and numerous

Letters of William D, Smith, being entire-
ly Civil War correspondence to his wife and
family somewhere in North Carolina. Smith
was with the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry. His
letters are poorly written and contain little
of value. However, in the undated material

is a letter telling of the very young and
poorly equipped boys being sent to the South-
ern front, and in the same letter Smith
speaks of two men in his brigade shot for

desertion.

The chief information to be found in this
collection is commodity prices, especially of:
cereals, including flour, which Smith was fur-
nishing for many retail dealers in Union County
during the Civil War and at least a decade later
Included also is a clipping of some length

taken from The Independent (New York) under date
of July 23, 1863, in which there is a scathing
denunciation of the recent draft riots in New
York. The editorial is entitled "The Northern
Rebellion," which is referred to as the instiga-

tion of Copperheads among the higher officials
of the state.

During the months of May and June, 1865, there
are several letters in which a soldier, James B,
Haslet, reports to his family on his experiences
and observations at various stopping places on
his "mustering out" maneuvers. On May 19 he
writes from Crestline, Ohio, that rumor has it
that a train carrying Jefferson Davis, as a
captive, is scheduled to pass through that city
on the next Sabbath, and his corps is there to
present a possible raid to release him, in-
stigated by the numerous Copperheads in that

vicinity.

burning a bridge,

As a U. &. Congressman, Smith received let-

W.N.H.Smith(1812-1889), was the son of Wm.
Lay Smith of Lyme, Conn.and Ann Harrell of Mur-
freesboro, N. C. He was educated at Yale and was
admitted to the N.C. bar in 1834. He immediately
moved to Texas, but remained there for only a

short time, returning to Murfgeesboro where he
married Mary Olivia Wise. In 1840 he was a whig
member of the House of lle and in 1848 he

was a_member of bhe Senate. In 1849 he was elect
ed solicitor and served until 1857 when he was

 
Smith, William Nathan Harrell. (2)

 

an unsuccessful congressional candidate for the
American party. He was elected in 1859 and ser-
ved until March 1861.

Opposed to secess&on he struggled to obtain a
compomise, but the call for troops decided the
matter for him. He has the distinction of being
a member of all the Confederate congresses. In
1865-1866 he was again a member of the state
assembly and supported a liberal policy towards
the freedmen. He supported President Johnson's

 
Smith, William Nathan Harrell. (3)

 

policy and was a delegate to the National Union
Convention in 1866. He opposed Radical control
of the state and to counteract this, he took ant
active part in the organization of the Conserv-
ative party. He was, in 1871; one of Governor
Holden's council in the impeachment trial and
dezivered all arguments. He became chief justice
of the state supreme court in 1878 and served mn
until his death.

This small collectim contains only two

 
Smith, William Nathan Harrell. (4)

 

Pieces. One concerns the election of Smith to
the Union Literary Society. The other, while
incomplete contains interesting comments on
Richmond in 1862, on England's attitude towards
the confederacy, and the attitude of the Negro
towards the War.

The Mss. added Nov. 9, 1937 contain twelve
letters written to Smith while he was a member
of the Yonfederate Congress. They contain

requests for pass ports, for additional supplies

for soldiers, for permission to be transferred
from regtient to another etc. The citizens of
Noriobk were so impressed by the Merrimac that
they wished additional ships of that kind to

be built. The money was to be raised by sub-
scriptions and the vessel was to patrol the

 

coast around Norfolk, Va., and Elizabeth Vity,
N.C. It is not certain with what success the
Broposition met. The remainder of the letters

deal with legal and business matters, with the

This collection contains the family correspon

County, Va, of William Smithson, probably her
father, and of her brothers and sisters. It is
neither a very interesting nor a very valuable
set of letters,

The earliest letters, written in the early

 

1320's, are to and from William M. Smithson of
Lunenberg. He was a commission merchant ané the

of 1863 he was stationed at James Island,
Charleston where he remained for several

 

months. In the late summer of 1863 he was
moved to Kenansville,Duplin county N.C.

The company was then moved to Virginia and

mother was evidently a widow,for Edgar often
wrote adviding her on financial matters and
regretting there was no one to hélp her with

Thomas Arthur Smoot (1871-1937), clergyman,
was the son of James Franklin and Virginia
(Brittingham) Smoot. He received the A.B.
degree from Trinity College, Durham, N.C., in

1895, and studied at Vanderbilt University in
1897-1898. In 1898 he married Leila Gilchrist
McGirt. They had three children: Thomas
Arthur, Edward Brittingham, and Mary Lily.
Smoot was headmaster of Trinity High School
(Trinity, N.C.) and then was professor of

.

physics and chemistry at Greensboro Female
College (Greensboro, N.C.) until 1900. In that
year he was ordained a minister in the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South. He served several
churches in Virginia and North Carolina before
his death in 1937: Fayetteville, Durham, and
Wilmington, N.C,, until 1910; Norfolk, Va.,
1910-1914 and 1929 until his death; Richmond,
Va., 1914-1922; and Dafmille, Va., 1922-1929.
He wrote numerous articles for religious per-

This collection consists mainly of regular
Sunday and Wednesday-night sermons delivered
at the churches Smoot served. There are only
three letters, none of which is very informa-
tive. There are also, however, several clip-

 

pings, some of which are of Smoot's writings,
as well as copies and drafts of his addresses
and writings. An address, dated July 17, 1856,

and bearing the name “Rev. J, F. Smoot" written

er urges the graduating class of an unnamed
Southern college to become good writers in
order to influence the tone and course of
American politics.

Smoot's own writings and sermons concern
Christianity, the Methodist Church, and the
Bible almost exclusively. Though relevant
social, economic, and political issues are
mentioned in terms of applying the messages of
his writings and sermons, there is no specific
discussion of such topics. The value of the

collection lies mainly in Smoot‘s applications

Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet.
Papers. Nutwood, Surrey, England

 

Sir James Carmichael-Smyth, First Baronet
(1779-1838), British army officer and colonial
governor, was the son of Dr. James Carmichael-
Smyth (1741-1821) who was one of George III's
physicians. Sir James Carmichael-Smyth had a

distinguished career in the Royal Engineers.
During the wars with France he served in South
Africa, Spain, Holland, and Belgium and was on

Wellington's staff at Quatre Bras and Waterloo.

 
 

Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 2
At Wellington's behest he inspected fortitica-
tions in the Low Countries and the West Indies
in 1823 and in Canada in 1825. His service
as a colonial administrator was as governor
of the Bahamas, 1829-1833, and as lieutenant
governor and governor of British Guiana, 1833-

1838. It was a time of stress in both colonies

because of the emancipation of the slaves, and
Carmichael-Smyth's actions (and the policies

of the Colonial Office) earned him the gratitude
of the magre population and the hostility

the planters. Upon

of many o

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 3
Wellington's recommendation he was created a
baronet in 1821. He wrote a number of books
about military subjects, Canada, and the West
Indies. His wife was Harriet Morse, daughter of
General Robert Morse. Their son, Sir James
Robert Carmichael, Second Baronet (1817-1883),
was a leading figure in the company that laid
the first submarine telegraph cables, those
between England and the continent in the 1850's
(in soe he resumed the surname of Carmichael
only).

The papers are principally useful for the

 

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 4
governorship of the Bahamas and British Guiana,
the submarine telegraph business, and the estate
of General Francis Dundas. Information about
Carmichael-Smyth's military career and his in-
spection of defenses in America is very limited.
The collection consists of family letters, diar-
ies, accounts, legal papers, etc.

The collection is arranged in the following
groups: letters; legal, financial, and miscel-
laneous papers; a submarine cable file; a file

on the estate of General Francis Dundas ;printed

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet
material; clippings; pictures and drawings;
oversize items; Latin compositions; and volumes.
A list of the events in Carmichael-Smyth's

early life and military career is in his Journal
(18 pp.), 1793-1819, that is written at the
beginning of Lady Carmichael-Smyth's Diary,
1819-1834,

 

Information about Carmichael-Smyth's mili-
tary career during the wars with France is very
limited, for there are only a small number of
manuscripts prior to the 1820's. His reconnais-

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 6
sance and advice led to the assault and capture
of Bergen-op-Zoom in the Netherlands in 1814.
In June of that year there is an account for
Secret service payments for missions associated
with that battle. He wrote a series of letters
to his wife during Sept.-Oct., 1818, from Cam-
brai where the army of occupation was about. to

return home. On Oct. 17, he gave his personal
evaluation of John Borthwick Gilchrist, the
Hindustani scholar who was seeking a post in

the Oriental Institution at London.

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 7

Carmichael-Smyth made two trips to America to
study defenses. In 1823 he went to the West
Indies. There are no letters from the islands,
but he did write about the Duke of Wellington's
reaction to his report (Apr. 1, 1824, and May 18
1825). The second inspection tour was in Canada
in 1825. His letters to his wife from Canada

 

are mostly personal in content, but he commented
about his work and his colleagues, John B. Har-—
ris and Sir George Charles Hoste.

During 1829-1833, Carmichael-Smyth was gover-

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 8

nor of the Bahamas. His son returned to ng Lane
for his education, and there is a series of let-
ters, 1831-1833, written to him by the Governor
and his wife. At that time the aholition of

slavery was approaching, and the policies of the
Colonial Office had aroused the hostility of the
slaveowners, The Governor was a champion of the

 

rights of the slaves and free colored people of
the islands. He prosecuted owners for mistreat-
ing slaves, and he encouraged the free Negroes
whose numbers were augmented by the settlement

 
 

Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 9
at Adelaide and Carmichael of persons réleased
from captured slave ships. These policies
aroused fierce opposition. In 1832 the Gover-
nor dissolved the Assembly and ruled without
it. The letters contain frequent comment about
the struggle with the Assembly and its adherent
the condition of the slaves and free colored

people, and the 2nd West India Regiment with
which Carmichael-Smyth also had difficulty.
His attitude toward his responsibilities is per-

haps revealed more openly in these intimate

Lady Carmichael-Smyth's Diary, 1819-1834, re- ©
cords activities in the Bahamas, but only in
brief entries except for seven pages in which

she reviewed the governorship at the time of her

departure in June, 1833. The diary is a good
indicator of the people with whom the Governor
associated.

In 1833 Carmichael-Smyth was advanced in the
colonial service by appointment as lieutenant

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 11
governor of British Guiana (and as governor in
1836). He had hoped for a more healthful cli-
mate, but the Colonial Office needed his skill
and experience at Georgetown during the diffi-
cult period when the sleres were being emanci-

pated. The appointment was explained in four
private letters from Lord Ripon and Lord Howick.

The Lieutenant Governor and his wife had favora-
ble initial reactions to the colony (letters of
May and August). Their son soon joined them,
and there are no further letters about Guiana

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 12
except for one of Feb. 11, 1838 (enclosed on
Dec. 24, 1850), in which Carmichgel-Smyth pro-
tested about his salary. He died at Georgetown
on March 4, 1838. Lady Carmichael-Smyth's
diaries during 1833-1838 are still basically a
record of activities and the coming and going of
people, but they contain more political comment,
occasionally with some details, about Guiana
than about the Bahamas,  .Strmgles with the
planters, the condition of the Negro population,

and the military establishment were the main

 

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 13
topics.

There are scattered family letters from the
1840's to 1952 relating to: Sir James Robert
Carmichael, Second Baronet; Sir James Morse Car-
michael, Third Baronet; his cousin, Sir James
Forrest Halkett Carmichael; and others. Nota-
ble items include: a political letter of Sir

 

William Hutt, M. P., Jume 14, 1848; Sir James
Robert Carmichael's appeal to the Colonial
Office for employment, Dec. 24, 1850 (with refer

ences to his father's career as a colonial gov-
ernor); Thomas W. J. Connolly's letters of 1860

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 14
about his projected biographical work on the
Royal Engineers; a letter of 1865 from Sir
Robert H. Schomburgk, the explorer; and a let-
ter of 1875 from Sir David Monro, a New Zealand
politician, about economic policy there (the
Monros were cousins of the Carmichaels). Sir
James Morse Carmichael had no children. A copy
of his will of 1901 is enclosed in a letter of
1924, The will lists seven paintings bequeathed
to the National Gallery; they are also noted in

a letter of 1901 from Poynter, the Gallery's

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 15
director. Some family portraits are also listed
and some of the painters are named. On Oct. 17,
1818, Carmichael-Smyth mentioned having his por-
trait painted by a French artist. An inkstand
given to an ancestor by the poet George Keate is
noted in the will.

Carmichael-Smyth served under General Francis

 

Dundas (d. 1824) at the Cape of Good Hope and
was one of the trustees of his substantial -
estate. A folder of eight detailed manuscripts,

1818-1827, concern the estate. They include
legal documents, minutes of the trustees, and

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 16
financial statements.

Sir James Robert Carmichael, Second Baronet,
was chairman of the first company that laid a
submarine telegraph. A Submarine Cable File of
twenty-two items, 1852-1860's, has records about
the company that constructed the cable between
England and Belgium in the early 1850's. A
principal figure was John Watkins Brett who
built the first submarine cable,-the one between
England and France, about which there is a pam-
phlet, Convention Relative a la Communication

par des Conducteurs Electriques entre Londres

 

 

 

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 17
et Douvres (1852). There is also comment about
the relationship of the companies operating the
French and Belgian cables. The papers include:
Brett and Carmichael's application for the Bel-
gian concession in Jan., 1852; their correspon-
dence about security money in March, 1852; Car-
michael's explanation to Lord De Mauley, May 28,
1852, of why the concession was made in Carmich-
ael and Brett's names; memoranda on the con--
tracts for manufacture of the cable, July-Aug. ,

1852 (several similar memoranda are undated); a

 

 

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 18
minute on the settlement with Brett, July 25,
1853; letter of Aug. 8, 1853; and enclosed
account about the disposition of 21,200 shares;

notes (watermark of 1860) about the Belgian
Concession, 1847-1852; and other items. Letter-

heads give the com

pany's name as the Sub-Marine

 

Telegraph Company |

between Great Britain and

the Continent of Europe. Among the volumes,

Lady Carmichael-Smy

th's diary includes brief

references during 1850-1861 to her son's acti-
vities with the submarine telegraph business

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 19
and the construction of cables in various parts
of Western Europe. Dividends from several sub-
marine telegraph companies are recorded in Car-
michael's bankbooks of 1865-1871 and 1875-1880.
Carmichael and Brett signed as the directors and
founders of the Sub-Marine Telegraph Company and
of the European and American Telegraph in their
letter of Jan. 12, 1852.

Lady Harriet (Morse) Carmichael-Smyth's "Mem-
oranda of most of the circumstances of my life"

(55 pp.) records events through 1810. A note on

 

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 20
page one states that these memoirs were “begun
15th April 1810." Pages 1-48 are on paper bear-
ing watermarks of 1809, and the last seven pages
bear watermarks of 1812. The memoirs are prin-
cipally about family and social life. They have
interest for the many references to her father,
General Robert Morse, who was inspector general
of fortifications in Britain during 1802-1811.
These references are brief and personal, but
they should be useful to a biographer. Many

prominent families are mentioned, particularly

 

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First” Baronet 21
that of Sir John Simeon, First Baronet, whose
children Richard and Emily were close friends of
Harriet Morse and her elder sister Sophia.
courtship of Richard Simeon and Sophia Morse

(d. 1810) is a poignant story; their romance was

 

opposed by the parents for financial reasons.
Lady Carmichael-Smyth's Diaries (2 vols.),

1819-1863, are continuous except for 1839-1849.
Family activities and those of friends and rela-
tives were recorded in brief entries. Their

value for the careers of her husband and son

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 22
has been noted above. There is also a literary
matter, for in 1818 her husband's younger bro-
ther, Major Henry William Carmichael-Smyth, mar-
ried the widowed mother of William Makepeace
Thackeray. There are numerous references to
visits by Thackeray--but without further comment
Lady Carmichael-Smyth usually recorded the names
of guests, so the references might be useful for
associations. The earliest notice of Thackeray
may be that of March 7, 1827, and there is one

at least as late as 1851. A few similar refer-

 

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 23
énées might be y

co Carmichael-Smyth died on September 23,

870.

Sir James Robert Carmichael's Diary, 1839,
contains brief entries about his activities in
England and Ireland. In June he went to Ireland
as aide-de-camp to the lord-lieutenant.

References to the Monro family can be found
throughout the family correspondence and diarie
Carmichael-Smyth's sister Maria married Dr.
Alexander Monro (1773-1859), the anatomist. His

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 24

 

son Alexander is probably the one mentioned so
often in the diaries.

There are four account books. The earliest
is entitled "Nutwood Cottage-taken lst Septem-
ber 1819, Memoranda as to Expenses in furnish-
ing Nutwood Cottage-and in building and improv-
ing there." Carmichael-Smyth took over Nutwood

Cottage in Sept., 1819 (See Lady Carmichael-

Smyth's diary for Sept. 9). Bankbooks of 1865-
1871 and 1875 +1880 ‘are for Sir’ James. Robert

Carmichael's account with Messrs. Ransom, Bou-
verie & Co. of London. A small volume is the

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 25
account from the auction at Frome on June 15,
1888, of the books of Major Robert Carmichael-
Smyth (d. 1888), brother of the Governor.

A folder of legal, financial, and miscel-
laneous papers, 1800-1920, includes a baptismal
certificate, a marriage settlement and certifi-
cate, a will, an army commission, grants of
honors, financial accounts of Sir James Robert
Carmichael, 1837-1841, and other items belong-
ing to various members of the family. The codi-
cil of Sept. 2, 1879, to Robert Carmichael-

 

 
 

Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 26
Smyth*s will is useful for identifying members
of the family.

The pictures and drawings include: a photo-
Beart of Sir Francis Chantrey's bust of Governor
armichael-Smyth in the cathedral church at
Georgetown, British Guiana; a lithograph of a
drawing of Government House at Nassau in 1832

(the origin of the picture is explained in a let
ter of July 3, 1832); pencil drawings of Trini-
dad and Dover, apparently by Sir James Robert
Carmichael; two plans, 1855, of the Paris apart-

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 27
ment where someone in the family was born in
1856; four photographs of unidentified persons;
and two other drawings.

There is a folder of Latin compositions, 1827-
1828, of Sir James Robert Carmichael while a
student.

The Printed Material, 1843-1919, includes:

a petition of ca. 1843 relating to the judicial
career in India of David Carmichael-Smyth; a
bill of complaint from a lawsuit of Sir James
Robert Carmichael in 1860; a leaflet, ca. 1861,

 
Smyth, Sir James Carmichael-, First Baronet 28
with correspondence from the latter*s claims
against the Colonial Office for obligations in-
curred when his father was in British Guiana; a
memorandum of May, 1879, in which Sir Jams
Morse Carmichael advised the government how to
manage and publish statistics; an undated leaf-
let about the poet George Keate that includes

his poem addressed to Dr. Carmichael-Smyth upon
the occasion of presenting him a silver ink-
stand (of which a picture is included); and

other items.

Thomas Smyth (1808-1873), Presbyterian
clergyman and author, was born in Belfast,
Ireland. His father, Samuel Smyth, was a
businessman and a ruling elder in the
Presbyterian Church. After suffering financial
reverses, the family moved to America in 1830.
Thomas Smyth was educated in Belfast and London,
and at Princeton in the United States. On
Oct. 4, 1831, he was ordained to the ministry,
and he then became pastor of the Second
Presbyterian Church ‘oe where he

 
Smyth, Thomas (1808-1873) 2
lived for the rest of his life. His theolog--
ical works are extensive. The Complete Works
of Thomas Smyth, D.D. were published during
1908-1912 in ten volumes. A biographical sketc
is in the Dictionary of American Biography.

The collection includes the small manuscript
volumes of twelve sermons or tracts, 1830-1861,
of which only three have been published in the
Complete Works. Several sermons concern
communion, and there are one each about
death, sanctification, the nature of sin,
commerce and Christianity, civil polity and
Christianity, and the i celebration

 

 

 

 

 

 
Smyth, Thomas (1808-1873) D
of the Second Presbyterian Church in 15861.
Three volumes are apparently parts of a sermon
or tract that Smyth wrote after the capture of
Fort Sumter. He usually dated the sermons

and often noted on them the dates and places
where they were delivered. A listing of the
sermons is in the Autograph File; it includes

 

notations about their publication, when this
is known.

Most of the sermons may be in Smyth's
handwriting. However, there are enough
dissimilarities in style to raise doubt about
what handwriting is ~ a his. Consequently,

 
Smyth, Thomas (1808-1873) 4

 

none of the sermons have been designated as
holograph on the cards in the Autograph File.
Several Smyth letters in other collections

also have variant styles of handwriting. His
paralytic stroke of 1850 affected his writing,
at least initially. See Thomas Smyth,

Charles Snow (1803-1884), physician and drug-
gist, who migrated, along with his brothers
Henry Adams and Zabdiel Boylston Snow, from
Fitchburg, Mass., to Tuscaloosa. They were the
sons of Dr. Peter and Elizabeth (Adams) Snow of
Fitchburg. Charles Snow practiced medicine in
Tuscaloosa Co. and managed the drug department
of Henry A. Snow and Company, of which he was a
partner. He was a Whig and Episcopalian.
Married: (1) Oct. 7, 1828, to Sarah Myra
Perkins; (2) May 24, 1831, to Virginia Penn.

and sister in Saco, Maine, and Fitchburg. The
last letter is addressed to his wife in March
1850 from New York, where he had gone to buy
goods.

To his mother he writes about the business
he and his brothers are engaged in; their heal-
th; religion and social life and customs, es-
pecially the celebration of Christmas and Jack-
son's victory at New Orleans, in Tuscaloosa; two
murders in the state by slaves, one of a master
and the other of an overseer; his dislike of the
practice of medicine; the election of his

 

 
Snow, Charles 4
brothers to the local board of aldermen; re-

election of Henry to the board of directors of
the State Bank; their purchase of a Negro boy,
aged fifteen; and his attitude toward slavery.

To his wife he mentions his visiting Cong-

ress while stopping off in Washington. He saw
Henry Clay and Vice-President Fillmore and de-

 

scribes their personal appearance. Calhoun,

he says,was absent from sickness. He did not
attend President Taylor's "presentation night,"
but he saw his horse "Old Whitey," and describes
the horse and his stable, He says there is

he never feels safe on southern boats but that
he does on northern ones.

Snow Family. Papers, Elyria, Lorain Co.,
Ohio

 

This collection contains the letters of two
members of the Snow Family, Horace N. and
Samuel W., who were probably brothers, Horace
served with Company I of the Eighth Volunteer
Infantry in 1861 and 1862. In October, 1862

he was admitted to the Mansion House Hospital,
where he became a clerk after he recovered his
health, He was honorably discharged in December
to join the Military Telegraph Service. Samuel

 
Snow Family

 

served with the Twenty-Fifth Iowa Volunteer
Infantry, which, at least by 1865, was in the
Fifteenth Army Corps, First Division, Third
Brigade, According to the Official Records, he
was acting assistant adjutant general in Febru-
ary, 1865, and by March was assistant adjutant
general of volunteers, Evidently he was pro-
moted from lieutenant to captain in that month
also. There is one letter by Ed. H. Hazen,

a steward in the First Division, General
Hospital in Alexandria, Virginia.

Most of the letters in the volume were

written by Horace to his parents and sister in
Ohio. His army career was spent mainly in
Virginia, in such places as New Creek, Camp
Chase, Luray, and then the hospital in Alexan-
dria. As a military telegraph operator, he
wrote from various headquarters in Virginia,

 

such as Yorktown and Ft. Magruder, as well as
from Jamestown Island, Bermuda Hundred, Farm-
ville, Lynchburg, and Richmond. He told of the
movements of troops and of the telegraph lines

and operators. Two interesting letters of
April 8 and 10, 1865, give some details of the
surrender at Appomattox. There is one letter
written by Hazen to Horace's sister Fannie
telling that her brother is in the hospital in
Alexandria. A few letters in the period,
1863-1865, were from Samuel Snow. He was
wounded in battle and wrote from a hospital in
Marietta, Georgia, in 1864. Ina letter of
March 28; 1865, he told of Sherman's campaign
in the Carolinas in which he participated.

Milwaukee, Milwaukee Co., Wisc.

 

These papers are primarily mimeographed items
produced by the Socialist Party, U.S.A. This
organization grew out of the Socialist Party of
America, beginning particularly in the late
1960s when a group within the Socialist Party
formed the "Debs Caucus." The members of this
leftist-oriented group considered themselves to
be in the tradition of Eugene Debs and Norman

Thomas. In 1972, the Socialist Party voted to

 
 

Socialist Party, U.S.A. 2
merge with the Social Democratic Federation. At

this point some members and locals withdrew from
the organization, while others decided to remain
within the "Debs Caucus." Also, the Union for
Democratic Socialism was formed in an attempt to
bring all leftist socialists together, At the
end of the year the Socialist Party, which was

officially now called the Socialist Party-Demo-
cratic Socialist Federation, U.S.A., became the
Social Democrats, U.S.A, Reacting negatively to

this change, socialists asked the Socialist Party

 
 

Socialist Part U.S.A 3
Of Wisconsin to host a national convention in

order to unite the old "Debs Caucus." The re-
sult was the formation of the Socialist Party,
U.S.A. in May, 1973, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
The organization supports democratic socialism
and social control over industry, and opposes
communism, Frank P. Zeidler, former socialist

mayor of Milwaukee, became the national chair-
person.
Zeidler, a long-time socialist, donated these

papers. He was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in

 
 

Socialist Party, U.S.A 4
1912, the son of Michael and Clara (Nitschke)

Zeidler, He attended Marquette University, the
University of Wisconsin, and the University of
Chicago. Zeidler's public service included
holding local offices, as well as his tenure as
mayor of Milwaukee, 1948-1960. Also, he has
served on the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO

and the Executive Board of the American’ Munici-
pal Association. Since 1960, he has been self-
employed, primarily as a management consultant
for universities and governments. Zeidler has

 
 

Socialist Party, U.S.A. 5
served as Secretary of the Milwaukee County Cen-
tral Committee of the Socialist Party and hes
held the same office for the Socialist reaty of
Wisconsin. In 1976, he was the presidentia
candidate of his party.

The papers, although spanning the years 1951

to 1976, concentrate mainly in the 1973 to 1975

period. As is usual with this type of material,
“cp general subject entries were made for it,
fo)

although autograph cards were prepared for the
numerous Ziedler items.

 
 

Socialist Party, U,S.A, 6
In the general papers are the press releases,
letters, and statements produced by the Social-

ist Party, U.S.A. Included also are some min-
utes of National Conventions and National Action
Committee and National Committee meetings. There
is information on Mayor Henry W. Maier of Mil-
waukee and a platform for 1976. Many of the

press releases are from the Information Service
of the party. The Zeidler material includes
articles about him as well as letters and state-

ments he made in behalf of the party. There is

 
Socialist Party, U.S.A, pte 7
information, which was prepared in 1975, on the
Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates of
the Socialist Party, U.S.A. for 1976, who are
Zeidler and John Quinn Brisben, respectively.

The miscellany consists of items collected by
the Socialist Party, U.S.A. from outside groups
or individuals. The Socialist Parties of

 

Illinois and Madison, Wisconsin, are represented
as well as information on Brisben as the social-
ist candidate for mayor of Chicago in 1975.

There is a folder for the Socialist Party of

Socialist Party of America Preface

 

The reorganization of the early records
of the Socialist Party of America was started
in the summer of 1964. With about 210,000
items and 23 volumes at that date, these papers
which contain a great variety of materials, are

arranged in this reorganization with the aim
of securing the greatest ease in locating na-
tional and state party papers, as well as manu-
script materials pertaining to individual
Socialists, Five divisions of manuscripts

 
Socialist Party of America Preface 2
have been acquired since 1942,

The first group has been described in the
Guide to the Manuscript Collections in the
Duke University Library by Tilley and Goodwin.
Later papers to 1940 are described in the main
file sketch which follows this preface.

 

 

 

The activities of the Socialist Party in
various states is well depicted, each local
group being represented by leaflets, publi-
cations, correspondence, and some organiza-

tional files. Of note after Aug. 11, 1911,

 
Socialist Party of America Preface 3
is the work of the head of the Information
Department, Carl D. Thompson.

Also of note is a file of Communist infor-
mation kept by the party on the radical element
which became the American Trotskyites. A few
copies of letters by Leon Trotsky together

 

with miscellaneous minutes and programs of the
Workers’ Party and the Revolutionary Workers'
Party comprise the bulk of this file. Hugh
Oehler, A. J. Muste, P. Eiffel, T. Stamm, Jay

Lovestone, Max Schachtman, and other Commun-

 
Socialist Party of America Preface 4

 

ists are involved. The 1919 expulsion of the
communists, represented by the Party in Michi-
gan, is reflected in the general correspon-
dence, while the 1937 expulsion of this group
is shown in the national office files.

Papers in this department for the organization
of this collection. Autograph cards for works
and correspondence have been made to 1940 for
the leading Socialists, but the papers are so
voluminous that many individual party members

 
Socialist Party of America Preface 5
from local groups have not been autographed.

In July, 1874, several New York sections
of the Socialist International formed the
Socialist Labor Party. In June, 1897, Eugene
Victor Debs organized the Social Democracy of

America, a plan for Socialistic colonization.
In 1898 he repudiated his own plan and formed
the Social Democratic Party. In 1901, how-

ever, the Social Democratic Party merged with

 
Socialist Party of America 2

certain less revolutionary elements in the

Socialist Labor Party to form what has been

known since as the Socialist Party of America.

The complete proceedings of the Unity Confer-

ence of 1901 begin the National Office File.
Of this party Eugene Debs was the out-

 

standing figure until his death in 1926.

Since then Norman Thomas has been the leader.
Though it has had many difficulties and emer-
gencies, the Party has managed to maintain its

basic integrity until the eve of World War II,

 
Socialist Party of America

 

when it split over the problem of isolation
vs. intervention.

The ups and downs of the Party are easi-
ly seen in its papers, for they contain,
(1) the office files of Carl Thompson from
1901 to 1938--all the varied correspondence

on matters of campaign, personal membership,
organization, finance, polity; (2) thousands
of press releases of the Party; (3) broad-
sides issued by National, State, and Local
offices; (4) circulars; (5) photographs; (6)
letter-books; and (7) court records. These

 
Socialist Party of America 4
came to a total of approximately 95,000 pieces
in 1956.

The material for the period from 1900 to
1910 is limited, but practically all of that
which is in existence will be found in this
collection. There are the letterbooks of the
early national secretaries and the proceedings

 

of the conventions. Such office correspondence
as there was, largely that of Carl D. Thompson
and the beginnings of his Information Depart-

Ment, will be found here. Much of the material
from the year 1905 to the year 1911 consists

 
Socialist Party of America 5
of copies of bills introduced into the Wiscon-
sin Legislature, that state having been a
stronghold of Socialism fromthe first. The
main issues reflected in these early years are
not national ones, but such things as treacher-
ous local officials and difficulties with the

 

lower organizations. There was also in this
period a strong effort to have municipal
utilities operated under Socialist principles.
There is indication, too, that the Party was
at this time giving its aid in a very wise
way to ps, gage s Movements (see letter of

April 2

 
Socialist Party of America 6
The years of World War I were not good

ones for Socialists in America. Part of their

creed is the condemnation of war--never popular

in time of war. Some of the Party members

personally acted by this belief and many of

them were very energetic to try to persuade

 

others also, For this reason a number of So-
cialists were accused of interfering with the
draft and of refusing to report for duty when
called to service. The whole Socialist Party
came under the distrust and suspicion of the
Government. Elements in these papers reflecting

 
Socialist Party of America

this are:

1) A letter from Upton Sinclair to President
Wilson (Oct. 22, 1917) protesting the
Socialists’ loss of civil liberties.
Among other things, they had been refused
the use of the United States Mails.

2) Court papers and correspondence concerning
several young Socialists who had evaded
the draft or refused to report.

3) Court papers and correspondence of Socialists

accused of sedition for teaching and

 

 
Socialist Party of America 8
agitating against the draft. Most
notable in this connection is the five
volume complete court record of the trial
of Victor Berger and others in Illinois
in the latter part of 1918. Also a let-
ter or two from Earl Browder's brother
concerning Earl's trial.

 

4) Extended efforts, beginning in this period,
to gain amnesty from the Government for
political prisoners.

The Socialist Party of America has always

 
Socialist Party of America 9
been opportunistic in its approach, Its aim
has been that of other Labor and Socialist
Groups--to do away with capitalism and substi-
tute an economy by and for the producer, but
it has attempted to do so by peaceable means--
election of political officials, etc. There

 

have been in it, however, elements of the
more radical movement which might be called
revolutionary Socialism, the uprise and revolt
of the worker to overthrow the capitalistic
system by force, Encouraged by the Russian

 
Socialist Party of America 10
revolution of 1917, this element began to as-
sert itself and this situation, too, is found
outlined in this collection. There are pieces
of private correspondence and Party correspon-
dence about the situation, There are outlines
and agenda for the conventions, There are in-
dications of opposing conventions meeting simul-
taneously in the same city, sometimes in the
same building. The controversy came to a cli-
max in 1919 when the more radical group seceded
from the Socialists. This group again split,
the extreme left wing forming the Com-

 

 
Socialist Party of America 11

 

munist Party and the center-left, the Communist
Labor Party, Especially enlightening on this
are the bound copies of the proceedings of the
national conventions of 1919 and 1920.

The. early period of the history of the party
is marked by correspondence of state secre-

taries and various members of state parties,
most of whom were concerned with local reforms
and most of whom remained on the local level.
Among these party members were the following:
Thomas W. Williams of California, T.E, Latimer
of Minnesota, Clarence Gilbert Hoag of the

 
Socialist Party of America nn lla
American Proportional Representation League,
Charles A. Mullen of New York, M. J. Scanlan of
Massachusetts, Charles H, Morrill of Massachu-
setts, Christian M. Madsden of Illinois, Ben-
jamin Wilson of Kansas, W. H. Kingery of Wash-
ington, A. Grant Miller of Nevada, Karl F. M.

 

Sandburg of the People's Money League, E. H.
Kiefer of Wisconsin, Daniel W. Hoan of Ohio, J.
Graham Phelps Stokes of the Intercollegiate So-
cialist Society, H. E. Thompson of North Dakota,
Charles Edward Russell, A. James MacDonald of
New Mexico, C. H. Conner of Montana, J. Mahlon

 
Socialist Party of America 11b
Barnes, Debs's 1912 campaign manager and head
of the American Freedom Convention, E. H. Thomas
of Wisconsin, Samuel E. Beardsley of Connecti-
cut, Robert Ringler of Pennsylvania, Walter C.
Cook of Georgia, and Walter A. Cook of New York.
The early national secretaries did not leave

 

extensive records until the term of Adolph
Germer. John M. Work and Walter Lanfersiek,
both of whose correspondence appears in the pa-
pers, left few papers. The early letter books
of Mailly and Butscher are thus very valu-
able. In the period, 1915 to 1920, Otto

 
Socialist Party of America llc
Branstetter, his wife Winnie, Camille Huysman

of Belgium, Julius Gerber, Victor Berger,
William James Ghent, and many other prominent
Socialists begin correspondence with the nation-
al office and Carl D. Thompson. Such older
members as John Spargo and John C. Chase are

 

also represented in the files. George Roewer,
Jr., of Massachusetts is also represented by
letters some of which describe the defense of
Kate Richards O'Hare and her final pardon from
the federal penitentiary.

The next extensive interest in the Socialist

 
Socialist Party of America lld

 

Party appears in the MSS, in 1923. At this
time the members had recovered from the arrests
and the confusion of the First World War. Otto
Branstetter had moved the Party into new Head-
quarters in Chicago, from which his Prison Com-
fort Clubs had sent cheer to the members behind

bars. By 1921 Eugene Debs and many others were
free again, The Party began to put forth very
active efforts to organize and spread the move-
ment. Speakers were sent out over the country
to educate laborers on the principles of the

 
Socialist Party of America 12
American Socialist Party and then to organize
them into city groups, known as Locals. If
there were several groups in a city they were
designated as Branches of the local. The most
famous of these speakers was Eugene Debs. Dur-
ing the war he had been imprisoned on an espio-

 

nage charge and no efforts could secure

his release until 1921, at the very close of
the year. As soon as he had recovered some-
what from the ill health occasioned by his
imprisonment, he plunged into the work and was,
by reason of the affection and esteem in which

 
Socialist Party of America +5
he was held, the most effective of the speak-
ers. Although he was their candidate and
spokesman, Debs was never the policy-former
of the Party but the one whose sturdiness of
character held it to its course,

Much opposition in this period, especially

 

in Indiana (home state of Debs), came from the
Ku Klux Klan. This is not strange, since the
work of the Party has seldom known faith or
race, Relations with the Catholic Church were
not always the most amicable (not the Party's
fault) but there were good Catholic Socialists,

 
Socialist Party of America 14
and many of the Party Leaders from the begin-
ning were those of Jewish faith. Color and
race, too, have been disregarded in Party or-
ganization. Socialists have tried to aid
Negroes, naturalized aliens, and even resident
unnaturalized aliens. For this reason the
Ku Klux Klan in 1923 tried terrorism not only
on the Socialist leaders but also on those
among whom they worked.

In the years just preceding the Depression
of 1929, the work of Socialist organization was
difficult. Most workers had good-paying,

 

 
Socialist Party of America 15
comfortable jobs, and there was Little of

the labor unrest on which the Party thrived

by its very nature. Finances were hard. It

is true that in June, 1929, the Party in New
York opened Radio Station WEVD, but in the

Same year the National Office had $400 and $500

 

notes which it was unable to pay.

In the same year, too, began a great re-
vival of interest in Socialism. In August,
1929, a young man named Clarence Senior was
made Executive Secretary. In his youth and
enthusiasm he plunged into a most active pro-

 
Socialist Party of America 16

 

gram of organization and membership- gaining,
which greatly revived the Party. An able,
experienced, and shrewd secretary was not
needed as much at this period as at others
in the Party's history because the collapse
of prosperity and the. wave of unemployment
were driving workers back "into the fold."
One of the chief elements in this revival
was the Party's "Jimmie Higgins" contest.
"Jimmie Higgins" was the prototype of the or-
dinary lay Socialist, not in Party employ as

Ject was for these lay Socialists to gain re-
eruits to the Party and to the Young Peoples!
Socialist League (see below). First prize
was a trip to the Vienna conference of the
Socialist International. Also a vital part
of the campaign was the "Socialist Forward
Drive," an effort in 1931 to raise sufficient
finances to properly execute the program of
the Party. None of its financial drives,
however, quite came up to its hopes or expec-
tations.

Membership, however, did grow tremendously.

Many locals were formed in New England, in
Califormia, in the Northwest, in the Middle
West. About the .end of 1931. the MSS. indi-
cate that interest and activities in the
Party began to look forward to the Presiden-
tial election of 1932. Soctalistic and Capi-
talistic papers alike began to predict a great
campaign for the Socialists. People of note
began to lend their support, notably Heywood

cis J. McConnell, John Haynes Holmes, Oswald

Sherwood Eddy, Robert Benchley, and Fannie
Hurst promised to write articles and most of
them did. Incidentally, there is an inter-
esting letter (Sept. 20, 1932) from Fannie
Hurst in which she states she has decided to
cast her vote for Roosevelt and the immediate
situation instead of "casting it into the
future."

The predicted vote to be polled by the
Socialist Party in that 1932 election was
3,000,000. The actual vote was between
875,000 and 900,000. Debs had received 919 ,=

799 in 1920. It was evident that the So-

cialists had built their hopes too high. Per-
haps the glowing predictions of their oppo-

nents had been designed to augment this situ-
ation. At any rate, the work of the Party in
the years following that election never quite

achieved the high pitch of the years before.
In 1933 the national office did not have money
to pay its telephone bills. The Party did

not cease to function; it merely concerned
itself with less gigantic, though perhaps
equally essential, endeavors.

Another problem of the period about 1930-
33 was reflected in efforts of the Socialists
to free fom Mooney. That problem was the con-
flict with the Communists. At this time the.
Communists seem to have been exerting all their
effort to discredit the Socialist Party and to
proselyte its members, using the Socialists
themselves as dupes. The real campaign to
free Tom Mooney began about 1932 with a
number of organizations united in the ef-
fort. The "Free Tom Mooney Congress" in
1932 was almost exclusively Communist, how-

 

 
Socialist Party of America _ 22

 

ever, and was used by the Communists to fur-
ther their own interests more than Mooney' s.
The MSS, in this period reflect various phases
of the Socialist-Communist struggle. In the
Labor file is William Green's report to the
President’ of the United States on Communist

activities in 1933.

The Socialist Party was vitally interested
in the plight of the share-croppers. There is
rather extensive correspondence on the mat-~-
ter of the condition of the 'croppers in Ar-
kansas, beginning about January, 1934. Howard

Kester, a Socialist, was associated with the
Southern Tenant Farmers' Union.* When the
crisis arose in Arkansas he went immediately
there and began to write to the National Of-
fice on the progress of the situation. Norman
Thomas also went to the scene and there are
letters of his, and letters about his presence

there. The incident 1s well outlined by the
letters and mimeographed enclosures of this

period.
Running throughout the set are letters and
other items concerning the Socialist publica-

Socialist Party of America 24
tions. In the earlier years every local
wanted its own newspaper, and they were almost
invariably poorly managed and improperly fi-
nanced so that only one or two of them had
any prolonged existence. One monthly maga-
zine in New York, The New Leader, has been
published for a good many years | now. In 19-
34 the Party began to publish a weekly news-
paper, The Socialist Call, which attained
national circulation. No. local publications
ever seem to have justified their own exis-
tence except the New York Call, of which the

 

 

 

 
Socialist Party of America 25
Duke University Library has a complete file.

Many of the papers for the years 1936,
1937, and 1938, include letters and other items
of the Young People’ s Socialist League. This
was an organization formed in the early years
of the Party to inculcate Socialist principles
in Young People. It was open to any young

 

person between the ages of 15 and 30. Mem-
bership in it was distinct from membership
in the Party, though one could belong to

both if he was of voting age. In 1936 the
e Yi

national headquarters o

psels, as

 
Socialist Party of America 26

 

they were called, were with that of the
Party, and its correspondence is as profuse
as that of the Party.

One must admire, with few exceptions, the
Party workers as they are depicted in the
Socialist Papers. Thomas, Senior, Morris

Hillquit and others were sincere, energetic,

businesslike, and unselfish, But this is not
always reflected in the Y.P.S.L. The letters
of the field secretaries and organizers often

 
Socialist Party of America 27
show very little of the energy, sincerity,
or purpose of the leaders of the parent
Party.

The work of the Socialists with the chil-
dren of workers was through a society
known as the Red Falcons of America. It

 

seems to have had some elements of the Boy
Scout movement, but never received the at-
tention given the Young People's Socialist
League.

Another phase of interest of the Party

 
Socialist Party of America 28
was Labor Colleges, of which the most famous
was the Brookwood Labor College at Katonah,

New York. In 1936 it organized the Debs Column
to go to Spain to aid the Spanish people in
their struggle against the Spanish Fascists,
and founded the Norman Thomas Home for Spanish

 

Orphans, These are only samples of the many

activities to which it lent its support.
There were other organizations too, which

were not directly endorsed by the Socialist

Party, but which had Socialist officials or

 
Socialist Party of America 29

 

leaders at their heads. These include the
League for Industrial Democracy, of which
Norman Thomas was a director; the Proportional
Representation League; the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored People;
and the Rand School of Social Science.

Added 8-28-48, 1 printed copy entitled,
"International," and 5 items MSS, music.
Additional papers (1914-1940) were cataloged
on 8-30-56. The Socialist Party papers de-
scribed in this sketch are arranged in three
categories: (1) correspondence,

 

2) national
office, and (3) Y.P.S.L.

Although the bulk of the correspondence,
which comprises the most important category,
was written during the 30's and in 1940, there
are a number of letters dated between 1914 and
1930. Important among the early letters are
those dealing with “® YPSL (Young People's

 
Socialist Party of America _ 38

 

Socialist League). The YPSL, Like the parent
party, suffered the dissension that resulted
in a split of the Socialists and Communists,
and the letters throw some light on the split
in the YPSL. They also give information con-
cerning: the organization of the YPSL in New

York City and throughout the state of New York
(1919); the history of the YPSL (1920); ri-
valry within YPSL after the split (1921, 1923,
1925, 1935); and the work of the yipsels (name
given to members of YPSL), especially during
national election campaigns.

 
Socialist Party of America 39
The dissension that beset the Yipsels was

an outgrowth of the controversy and antago-

nism that persisted within the Socialist Party,

even after the Communists broke away. During

the 30's the "Old Guard," a minority faction,

was forever at odds with the "Militant"

 

members, who counted Norman Thomas among

their number. The antagonism, which began
with opposing ideas concerning the fundamental
principles of socialism, showed itself in
various ways, being implicit in the following:
the attempt to remove Clarence Senior from his

 
Socialist Party of America 40

 

position of Executive Secretary of the party;
the removal of the Socialist Call (official
newspaper of the party) from New York to Mil-
waukee and the attempt made to move it back to
New York (1939-1940); the dispute over the lo-
cation of the National Office (30's); the po-

 

sition of the Socialist Party with regard to
organized labor (organized labor was the sub-
ject of much of the correspondence for 1939);
and the election campaign tactics (1936). Some
wanted to ally the Socialist Party with the
Farm Labor Party; some wanted to form a labor

 
socialist Party of America 41
party similar to the British Labor Party; and
some wanted simply to control the labor vote.
by converting workers to socialism; infil-
tration of key labor positions was a Communist
tactic, not a Socialist one.

The extent of the dissension was apparent

 

not only in the YPSL and National Office but
also among the members of the staff of the Call
(1936) and in the state organizations: Indiana
ieee): New York and New Jersey (1935); Con-
necticut, Kansas (1935); Pennsylvania (1935,
particularly Reading) California (1936),

 
 

Socialist Party of America 42
Ohio (1936). The Jewish branch broke away

from the Socialist Party.

Although the antagonism between the Old
Guard and the Militants weakened the party,
the position the party took concerning the
United States and World War II caused many of

the most convinced Socialists to resign. The
Socialist Party went on record, as the let-
ters show, favoring strict neutrality for

the United States. This meant no help for
Great Britain and came to megan only moder-
ate preparedness for the United

 
Socialist Party of America 43
States. Throughout 1939 and 1940, the Party
appeared to spend most of its energy on the
issues of war, neutrality, and preparedness,
much to the neglect of socialist principles
and criticism of ‘decadent capitalism.’ This
position was based on the erroneous evaluation

 

of public opinion regarding the relation of
this country to the war in Europe. True, the
United States was in an isolationist mood, as
the Socialist leaders recognized, but citizens
were sufficiently militant to accept peacetime
conscription. And . wo introduced a

 
Socialist Party of America 44
new force against the Socialist position -
nationalism.

When the Socialist Party opposed conscrip-
tion after it became law, many members resigned
because they could not reconcile opposition to
law with their duties as citizens. At the same

 

time, some members resigned because they thought
the Socialist position favoring moderate pre-
paredness was a breach of true Socialist prin-
ciples. Notable among these persons was Meta
Berger, the wife of Victor Berger, who was
accused of being sympathetic toward, if not a

 
Socialist Party of America 45

 

member of, the Communist Party. The fact that
Norman Thomas, who campaigned in 1940 on the
issue of war, received less than 100,000 votes
for president illustrates the incorrect evalua-
tion of public opinion, especially in view of
the optimism shown in much of the pre-election

correspondence.

Aside from the war issue, the Socialist Par-
ty campaign of 1940 (Norman Thomas and Maynard
Krueger), like the one of 1936 (Norman Thomas

and George Nelson) provided a full view

 
Socialist Party of America 46
of the many and varied activities that make up
a presidential campaign: the preparation for a
national convention; the planning of speaking
tours; the arduous task of collecting funds;
the work of the state and local organizations;
and the work of the YPSL and various youth

 

organizations, created especially to support
Socialist candidates, After elections, these
youth organizations were fertile ground for
recruitment for the Socialist Party .

One of the most difficult problems that
the Socialist Party r solve each election

 
Socialist Party of America 47
year was that of getting on the different
state ballots. Each state makes its own laws
for admitting a party on the ballot; thus
there are forty-eight sets of rules, many of
which involved the presentation of a specified
number of voters' names on a petition. Much

 

of the work of gathering signatures was done
by one paid party worker aided by members of
the YPSL and members of newly created youth
organizations. From the reports submitted

by these people to the National Office come
many amusing “sé experiences in the

 
Socialist Party of America 48

field, such as the collection of only twelve

cents from a rather large political rally.

There were also reports of violence in several

states - Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois (1940).
The Socialist Party, while it exerted

every effort, never believed that it would win

 

a national election; that is, Socialists saw
victory far in the future. The purpose of
their conventions and campaigns, as stated
privately, was to inform and educate for future

pactery. Of course they wanted and worked
for a large vote, for, as it is explained

 
Socialist Party of America 49
in the correspondence, a large vote not only
attracted the much desired attention but also
stood as a thumping protest against the pro-
grams of the traditional parties. But in the
20's and 30's education was the major aBpee-
tive. This was stated by Thomas and illustrat

 

ed by the amount of Socialist literature, by
the classes offered in principles of Social-
ism, by the Rand School of Social Sciences, by
the work of the Labor Research Front, ‘= the
letters of the regular party workers, and by
the tenor of Thomas! a

 
Socialist Party of America 50
The Socialist Party, in nearly all its
endeavors, found itself in competition with
the Communist Party, and this competition pro-
vided a fruitful source of information and
opinion on the Communists. The Socialist
Party papers show how Communist and Socialist

 

thinking differed on such important questions
as the Stalin-Trotsky rivalry and break, the
Soviet purges during the 30's, Communist acti-
vity during the Spanish Civil War, the Nazi-
Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the proper re-
lationship of the “6 States to the Euro-

 
Socialist Party of America Si
pean War, and the control of organized labor.
Also, from the Socialist papers come the
names of some organizations that were alleged-
ly Communist fronts, the names of some Com-
munist periodicals (Equality and New Masses),
and many comments on the strength and weak-

 

nesses of the Communist Party in the United
States.

While the Socialist Party of America was
concerned primarily with. domestic matters, it
also maintained some contact with the Socialist
organizations in “~@ Puerto Rico, Mexico,

 
Socialist Party of America 52

Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay. In Mexico,

Clarence Senior, Executive Secretary of the

Socialist Party, 1929-36, set up in 1940 a

Socialist information center in Mexico City,

and because of the work of Senior, the Social-
ist Party was in closer relationship with

 

Mexico than any other country. Senior's let-
ters show that the Socialist Party of America
had nothing to do with Trotsky and his follow-
ers, who arrived in Mexico soon after Senior's
first trip to Mexico in 1936.

Of the many ~“~@ connected with free-

 
Socialist Party of America 53
dom and justice that the Socialists backed,

with varying degrees of success, was that of
freedom for Mooney and Billings, jailed for
their alleged part in the preparedness day ex-
plosion in San Francisco in 1916. Both Mooney
and Billings gained freedom in 1939. Other such

 

projects were the fight for an anti-lynch law,
criticism of the violence in Florida (1935),
the fight against Frank ("I am the law") Hague
of New Jersey, the fight in behalf of the
DuQuoin, Illinois, boys, who had been convict-
ed unjustly of manslaughter, the aid given

 
Socialist Party of America 54
the Loyalists during the Spanish Civil War and
the criticism of the Non-Intervention Committee
for not stopping German and Italian aid to
Franco and his rebels.

Other causes and organizations either of
interest to or supported by the Socialist

 

 

Party were: the Red Falcons (Socialist Organi-
zation for Children); Southern Tenant Farmers'
Union; U.A.W.A. (United Auto Workers); Negro
Congress (1938); Teachers' Union (1939); Jane
Addams Peace School (1939); Cannery Workers
(1940); German Bundis (1940); U.A.W.-C.I.0.

Miscellaneous subjects treated for one
reason or another in the correspondence are:

Socialist Party of America 56
president of Finland after the Russo-Finnish
War; story of the Socialist Party records un-
til 1930; Victor Reisel's work against Com-
munists in labor organizations; list of for-
eign language publications in the United
States favoring the Socialist Party (1940);

 

comment on German military strength (1940);
the preparation-ef Lithuania for war by the
Soviet Union (1940); comment on conditions of
German prison camp Stalag 1113, "somewhere
near the Polish frontier" (Oct. 16, 1940); the

endorsement of “se by John L. Lewis

 
Socialist Party of America 57
(1940); opinion of Hitler by a German (1940);
activity of the press of the Social Democrats
of Germany (1939); refusal of some to conform
to the conscription law of 1940; and a copy

of a message sent to Abraham Lincoln and signed
by Karl Marx.

 

The Socialist Party Papers reveal two out-
standing facts about the party: the poverty
of the Socialist Party and the extremely com-
plicated and difficult job of trying to main-
tain a political party, especially one that
demands loyalty to a given

 
Socialist Party of America 58
set of principles and one that has no patron-
age for rewarding the faithful.

The poverty of the party could be illus-
trated in a thousand ways by a thousand dif-
ferent letters. For example in July, 1936,
one member complained: "We can't get our

 

platform printed, we can't get our buttons,
special leaflets:'or new pamphlets because our
credit is gone and cash is nil. Most state
and local organizations are using the first
money that comes in to put themselves back on
their feet... ." ‘6 of the regular party

 
Socialist Party of America 59
workers, such as the Executive Secretary,
worked without receiving their salary. Field-
workers hitchhiked from place to place; local
officers worked in the summer at other jobs so
they could afford to work for the “movement"
during the winter. Letter after letter from
the National Office asked for contributions of

 

any size, and any substantial contribution
(over $50.00) was received with elation. Also,
the Call was forever in need of money, as the
many letters concerning the newspaper show..
Poverty was only an added obstacle to the

 
Socialist Party of America 60
Maintenance of the Socialist Party and one that
would have been removed if the party had be-
come popular. But the drudgery of keeping the
party alive between presidential elections
must have been a monumental task, one that
certainly required patience, common sense, and

 

a sense of humor (characteristics displayed
by the better executive secretaries, Clarence
Senior and Arthur G. McDowell). The contrast
between the drudgery of the "between years"
and the feverish activity during an election
year is a study in ‘eo The editor and

 
Socialist Party of America 61
staff of the Call, the Executive Secretary
and staff, and Norman Thomas appear to have
carried the burden, as the letters for 1936
and 1940, which are full of information con-
cerning what goes into a political campaign,
show.

 

The letters also provide some insight in-
to the principles held by: Norman Thomas, the
Man most responsible for keeping the party
alive after 1928; Clarence Senior, one of the
most successful Executive Secretaries; and
Arthur G. McDowell, r successful as

respondence, national office papers, Y.P.S.L.
records, and the New York State Party files
all bring the records of the Socialist Party

of America down to 1966. Strong emphasis

on foreign affairs, pacifism, civil rights,
and student activities prevail in the papers.
Erich Fromm and Michael Harrington are among
the Socialist writers. Since 1957 the na-
tional party and the Social Democratic Federa-

 
Socialist Party of America 70

 

tion have been united in the same party.

Not only do the Socialist Party Papers reveal
the original split between militants and
conservatives in the mid-thirties in the
national office papers and correspondence,
they also contain records of the Social

Democratic Federation under August Claessens,
Algernon Lee, and Louis Goldberg, from 1936-
1957, as well as the papers concerning the
attempts to bring togablier the two factions
of the party. An unsigned and undated
statement by Norman Thomas on this split

 
Socialist Party of America 71
is placed at the beginning of the 195/ Nation-
al Office box, as it seems to have been written
at the time the two organizations were coming
together again.

The letters, carbons, notes, press releases,
seeing 4 clippings, pamphlets, and leaflets of

°

 

Norman Thomas from ca. 1920 dominate the So-
cialist files, showing his profound influence
on its thinking and activities.

files of William Becker, who was variously titled
as National Labor Secretary as well as Labor and
Organizational Secretary of the Socialist Party.
In addition he was Labor Editor of The Socialist
Call. These files had been a part of the Labor
Archives, but when that collection was cataloged,
it was discovered that these items should be a

 

part of the Socialist Party Papers.

Although most of the Correspondence is Becker
there are a few letters of Harry Fleischman, Na-
tional Secretary of the Socialist Party, and
Charles (Calogero) Taibi, Organizational Secre-
tary of the Party. Some_of this correspondence

 
Socialist Party of America 93

 

relates to the cooperation of socialists and
labor unions as well as to labor union members
who are interested in socialism.

The files, which span the years 1942-1950, are
organized alphabetically, with a folder for each
labor union included. Some of the American Fed-
eration of Labor unions are the National Farm
Labor Union, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and

Butcher Workmen of North America, and the Hotel
and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Interna-
tional Union. The Congress of Industrial Organi-
zations union folders, which primarily contain

 
 

Socialist Party of America 94
printed material, include the National Maritime

Union of America and the United Electrical,
Radio and Machine Workers of America.

Only two —— unions comprise this ad-
dition. The Mechanics Educational Society of A-
merica folder contains a Harry Fleischman letter,
and the International Association of Machinists

folder has a clipping about the union.

In addition to the correspondence, these files
contain mimeographed statements and press releases
as well as union propaganda. There are many

 
Socialist Party of America :

 

publications of unions, such as bulletins, agree
ments, constitutions, convention proceedings,
pamphlets, and leaflets, Becker also received
some information concerning The Socialist Call.
There is a folder entitled, “National Labor
Committee Mailings," which is primarily the
mimeographed correspondence of Becker and

Fleischman in regard to the National Labor Com-
mittee of the Socialist Party. The "Singer
Strike" folder contains clippings about the

strike at the Elizabeth (New Jersey) Plant of

 
Socialist Party of America 96

106 items and 1 volume added, 1-21-77: Cor-
respondence, resolutions, and some minutes, in-
cluding mimeographed material. These papers,
1965-1972, pertain primarily to the Democratic
Socialist Federation of the U.S.A., a group
which united with the Socialist Party-in about

 

1972 to form the Socialist Party-Democratic So-
cialist Federation, U.S.A. The correspondence
is mainly that of James S. Glaser, who was Na-

tional Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Fed-
eration of the U.S.A. Included are resolutions

 
Socialist Party of America 97
on various topics, such as human rights and
Israel, as well as minutes of meetings and con-
stitutions. There also is a City Central Com-
mittee file for New York.

1660 items added, 1-31-77: Papers of the
Socialist Party of New York, which span the years

trated during the period, 1966 to 1973. In-
cluded are correspondence, minutes, resolutions,

financial papers, and convention proceedings,
1968-1972, of the local party. Most of the ma-
terial is either mimeographed or typed.

Folders in an alphabetical arrangement cover

such

 
Socialist Party of America 99
topics as Aleksander Solzhenitsyn, Peace Groups, the
Young People's Socialist League of New York, and Civil
Liberties Union. Some political campaign material, for
example pertaining to Henry M. Jackson's campaign for
President and the Ryan-Abzug race, is also incorporated
in the subject files. Several folders contain minutes
and other papers of the City Committee of the party, and
other folders pertain to internal matters such as mem-
bership and constitutions.

After Louisiana was transferred from France
to the United States in 1803, the French in-
habitants felt a need for mutual aid, and this
desire by French New Orleanians led eventually

to the formation in 1843 of the Société
Frangaise de Bienfaisance et D'Assistance
Mutuelle de la Nouvelle-Orléans. The purpose
of the Society was to advance the moral

condition of its members, to provide assistance
during misfortune, to encourage the mutual wel-
fare, and to propagate the principles of

The volume is the Society's Register of
Members, ca. 1873-1898. The names of the mem-
bers are arranged by letters of the alphabet
and, within each letter of the alphabet by date
of admission into the society. There are
columns for names, ages, dates of admission to

 

the society, places of birth, and notations,
many of them dates of death. Many members were
born in France. The volume contains 212 pages
and an index, and most, but not all, of the

pages were used.

The Society's name does not appear on the
volume, and identification of its ownership was
obtained elsewhere. The names of most members
can be found in the city directories of New
Orleans. The deaths of three members in 1892
were traced into a newspaper, L'Abeille de la

Nouvelle-Orléans. In each case, the obituary
was followed immediately by an announcement by
the Society calling upon its members to assist
at the funeral. The obituaries checked were

 

 
Société Frangaise de Bienfaisance et D'Assistance
de la Nouvelle-Orléans 5
those of Germaine Barthe, Philippe Paul Chabert,
and the widow of Paul Dupont. It is clear from
the occupations of these people and of others
noted in the city directory that the Society's
membership was broadly based.

This volume was copied probably in the 1870s.
The earliest dated notation is 1873. Most of
the entries, exclusive of the notations, were
written by one person probably at one time.

The volume remained in use until 1898, the

 

 
Société Frangaise de Bienfaisance et D'Assistance
de la Nouvelle-Orléans 6
latest date of the notations. The latest date
for admissions into the Society was 1892 as
recorded under many letters of the alphabet by
which members’ names were arranged and listed.
The earliest date of admission was 1843.

Other records of this type are available at
the Historic New Orleans Collection, Royal
Street, New Orleans.

Solomons, M. J. Scrapbook, 1861-1863. Savannah
Ga. Sketch,

 

The M. J. Solomons scrapbook is a large and
detailed collection of newspaper clippings cov-
ering all sections of the Confederacy during the
first year and a half of the Civil War. This is
a panorama of Confederate life as told by its
newspaper reporters.

The Solomons family, led by Abraham A, (1816-
1899) and his wife Cecelia (Moses) Solomons came
from Charleston in 1845 to Savannah, The family
were druggists; Abraham's brother, Joseph M.
Solomons (1826-1921), was associated with him.
Joseph entered the “or service during

 
Solomons, M. J, a.

 

the Civil War. M. J. Solomons was in the gro-
cery business in 1849-1851, and his ledger for
those years was used as a basis for the scrap-
book. In 1867, the Savannah Directory lists
Abraham, Joseph and M, J. Solomons as druggists
living in the vicinity of Barnard Street in Sa-
Vannah,

The scrapbook has certain peculiar character-
istics. Prices of food and drugs are listed in
its clippings. Many items concern Southern wo-
men and their activities in the Confederacy from
raising money for a gunboat to actiné as spies
for the South. There S clippings directly

 
Solomons, M, J. 3

 

from the Bowling Green (Ky.) Daily Courier. The
war in the West receives more space than Virgin-
ia and the other Eastern theaters, Robert E,
Lee is barely mentioned, but John H. Morgan, P.
G. T. Beauregard, and Braxton Bragg have many
references, The scrapbook shows a marked bias

 

against Abraham Lincoln; many poems and clippirgs
denounce him, There is also a notable collec-
tion of Southern poetry about the Civil War.

The compiler was very much interested in reports
of arrests, depredations, and atrocities by Un-
ion troops at the ~“~é such generals as

 
Solomons, M. J. 4
Benjamin Butler,

It is not unreasonahle to presume one of the
women of the M, J. Solomons family group collec
ed the clippings. It is also not unreasonable
to presume she had relatives in Kentucky or in
the Confederate service in the West,

The reporting of battles is detailed, Many

 

Georgia regiments are described #® action. Un-
fortunately, the arrangement of clippings is not
exactly chronological,

The battle of First Bull Run made a profound
impression on Confederate imagination, That vio

tory and the conduct of General Butler in New
Orleans receive more space than any other sub-
jects. The following listings give a few refer-
ences to the more important topics.

The chronology of the war is given in detail
through 1862 (pp. 91, 367). Tennessee's record
is summarized (p. 390), and the organization of
Georgia into military divisions is noted (p.
370). The causes and consequences of the war
are reviewed in its first year (p. 107). A pic-
ture of the war unfolds in Virginia, North Caro-
lina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Ken-
tucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Arizona, Florida,
and Missouri, Events in Richmond, New Orleans,
New Bern, and Charleston (pp. 111-113), are re-

ported in the newspapers, Shepherdstown, Va.
(pp. 63, 85) is conspicuous for Union raids and
arrests of Confederate citizens. Much indirect
information develops on Confederate social life,
A glimpse is given of civilian life in the bor-
der states (p. 163) and in areas occupied by the
Union Army (pp. 184-185).

The economic side of the Civil War is reflec
ed in price quotations for food, drugs, and im-
ported goods (pp. 195, 161, 377, 406, 419, 474).
Lack of cotton cards (p. 191) and salt (p. 109)
is paralleled by Gov. Vance's appeal to N, C.

 

 
Solomons, M. J,

 

for clothes for soldiers (p. 67) and by a direc~
ory of salt works and their output in S. C. (p.
1 e
Connected with the interest in prices is the
reporting of Jewish commercial activities and
retalitory treatment by Confederates (pp. 95,
155, 406). A Jewish prayer at the dedication of

a Savennahysynagogue (pp. 445-446) is also giv-
en, Montge Mery , la.

The life of Negroes during the war, both in
relation to the Confederate owners and to the
Union Army and government is noted (pp. 86, 99,

 
Solomons, M. J.
150, 210, 478, 7349, 262, 349, 428).

Women in the Confederacy received many news-
paper notices, e.g. on spying, making clothing,
and raising money for gunboats. Their role in
espionage is exemplified by Rose O'Neal Greenhow
and Norah McCartey, among others (pp. 64, 66,
80, 83, 137, 150, 156, 160, 164, 167, 169, 179,

 

183, 221, 232, 261, 266, 270, 278, 292, 374,
391, 394, 403, 405, 423, 432-434, 481). Arti-
cles on arrests and hardships suffered are not
uncommon.

The campaigns and battles of the war are re-

 
Solomons, M. J. 14
ported by reports of correspondents, by soldiers’
letters, by proclamations of generals and offi-
Cials, and by general orders. Practically all
fighting from skirmishes to battles to campaigns
is described. The emphasis is in the war in the
Mississippi Valley. As most of these reports
are filed in haphazard order, it is necessary to
look through the entire scrapbook for material
on any one military event. The most important
references are listed as follows:

is mentioned (p. 206).

The Civil War gave rise to many interesting
adventures and incidents, The arrests for poli

 

ical reasons (p. 100 for example) and sequestra-
tion of property (p. 87).by both sides had im-
mediate repercussions among civilians, Union-
ists on the North Carolina coast (p. 102) were
led in Dec,, 1861, by Marble N, Taylor at Hat-

Solomons, M. J. 24

 

The Wm. G. Brownlow case (p. 105) in Tennessee
and Union bridge burnings there were serious mat
ters for Confederate authorities (pp. 103,105,
107, 158-159). The "Great Locomotive Chase" in-
volving Union spy Andrews in April, 1862, is
noted (pp. 170, 237). Guerilla fighting is des-
cribed in a poem (p. 361), and is reported also
from Alabama and Missouri (pp. 365-366, 420).
The Confederate press printed accounts of activi
ties of Congressman Edson Baldiwn Olds of Ohio
and of C. L. Vallandigham, and reported N. Y,.
advocacy of compromise with the South as a way
to peace (pp. 464, 466): Democratic opposition

 
Solomons, M. J, 25
to Lincoln and the Republicans is evident.

A lighter note is struck by the poets, such
as Henry Timrod, who wrote "Christmas" (p. 364).
A Confederate letter to Santa Clause comes from
Virginia (p. 361).

Confederate camp life is portrayed by sol-

diers' letters. The prisoners of war are excharg

 

ed (p. 390) under a cartel set up in July, 1862,
by Generals John Dix and D, H,. Hill (pp. 444,
448). See also pp. 401-402 for notes on treat-

ment of prisoners, Medical conditions at the

 
Solomons, M. J. 26

 

Battle of Winchester, May, 1862, are described
(p. 290). Health conditions of the Union Army
of Occupation in Louisiana, particularly mortal-
+1 ae analyzed by Dr. Samuel Cartwright (p.
312).

Among the aspects of foreign relations touch-

ed is the tense situation with Great Britain (p.
450). Lord John Russell and Seward correspond
on the blockade. Gideon Wells writes on the
Trent Affair (p. 452). On Dec. 22, 1862 (p.401)
M. F,. Maury writes to the London Times attack-
ing Lincoln and a fe the condition of the

Sommers was a native of Lillington, North
Carolina. He was educated at various schools
in N.C., including Ebeneger Academy, and at
the New Orleans Medical College from which he
Was graduated in 1859 or 1860. With the
beginning of the Civil War Somers became a

 

surgeon with the Confederate forces, and served
chiefly in Mississippi and Tennessee. It was
during this service, apparently, that he met

Miss. Maria H. Ewell, whom he married on

 
Somers, William D.

December 25, 1864.

In the year following the war he endeavored
to establish himself in medical practice at
Memphis, Tenn., while his wife remained at her
mother's home in La Grange, Tenn. In 1866
Somers established his household in Memphis,
but within two years moved to Collierville,
Tenn., where he resided for the memainder of
his life. In Feb., 1871, Mrs. Somers died,

leaving four children. In 1873 Somers married

her sister, Ella Ewell. For a time Somers
conducted a paper called The Spirit of the Age.

The war material is of some value, though
much of it consists of letters to "Tiny,"
Somers' pet name for his wife. The letters of
1865 particularly show the difficulty of

deriving an adequate income from almost any
occupation. The later letters are typical
family correspondence of the Reconstruction

Period full of small tribulations, illness,

debts, and poverty.

Orleans Parish, Louisiana. 44 items. Sketch.

 

This collection of letters and papers, all
in French, provides interesting material on a
variety of subjects. For the most part it con-
sists of letters, twenty-two in number, written
by Pierre Soulé, ” chiefly to Henri Rémy, but

there are also a few letters, poems and arti-
cles which are of a literary nature, a number
of them unsigned and undated.

Henri Rémy was not only Soulé's legal asso
late but, so said Soulé, his dearest friend from
whom he had no a } whose literary abil-

 
Soulé, Pierre 2

ity he admired.

The earlier letters deal largely with legal
Cases and with local politics. Among the later
letters are two written from Washington in 1850,
when he was serving as Senator from Louisiana,
in which he discusses Henry Clay, the attitude

 

of various journals and papers toward Clay; the
activity and influence of "Bennet," who was pro-
bably Henry Bennett, Representative from New
York; and his own "proud speech, "

Soulé was imprisoned for more than seven

 
Soulé, Pierre 3

months in Fort Lafayette and then was exiled to
Cuba where he remained for some two years. His
first letter, after his release, was written on
board the Roanoke on the 5th December 1862. It
gives a rather vivid account of his sufferings,
of his release and that of Mazureau, of his

 

reception in New York, of the conditions under
which he chose exile, and of the evils of the
customhouse in Louisiana and the destitution
which had fallen upon the people.

Later letters from Havana and from Marianao,
about nine miles from i speak bitterly of

 
Soulé, Pierre 4

 

conditions in Louisiana and New Orleans and of
the hypocrisy of the regime and the outrages
inflicted. One of the most interesting letters
of this period is a long one, written Mar. 5,
1863, in which Soulé discusses in much detail
the reasons for the attitue of England, Russia,

and France, the reaction of the legislatures of
Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, and Kentucky to
the threat of French intervention, and his own
reasons for believing that France would not

enter the war.

 
Soulé, Pierre 5

 

“In one of his letters he flays the conduct
of the ladies of New Orleans and of the assembly
held at St. Charles where General Banks was ass-
ailed in an oration which "surpassed in ignominy

. anything ever produced" and of which he
was heartily ashamed.

Later letters are full of the situation in
Charleston and his absorption in the drama being
enacted there. After his return he wrote from
Charleston of a trip he made to Florida with
General Beauregard. He speaks several times of

the Diario de la =e » the official publi-

 
Soulé, Pierre 6

cation of the naval station in Cuba, and of its
accurate and fearless accounts.

In connection with the situation in Charles
ton there is a lively letter from N. Soulé to
Rémy in July, 1863, in which he tells of his
work as Captain and inspector adjutant general

 

of the department which included North and South
Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Soldiers were
required, he said, to furnish their own horses,
were allowed $.40 a day for use and service,
were obliged to spend about $24.00 a month for

 
Soulé, Pierre ?

their upkeep, including corn and hay, etc. All
the young gentlemen from Louisiana, of whom
there were 78 from the best families, seemed to
prefer the light artillery, were very happy, and
would not change for anything in the world, he
declared,

 

Among other letters are three from a Ch.
Ferrand Ladraselle(?) to Rémy about the educa-
tion of children intrusted to care; a delightful
and tender letter from J. Norgués to his daugh-
ter Louisa; and a printed letter from Terence
Carriére to the voters of the parish of St. Tam-

 
Soulé, Pierre 8

 

many in 1845, giving the changes which had been
made in the constitution of Louisiana and which
he had supported in the convention and asking
for their support of able and experienced men
in the coming election.

Rather surprising to find in this collec-

tion are a number of papers which are chiefly of
literary value. It is possible that Rémy used
some of them or intended to use them in the
weekly journal of which he was editor in 1854-
1856. One is a brief note of no date and sig-
nature, giving the motives because of which the

 
Soulé, Pierre 2

writer had resolved to die—a love affair.

There is also an unsigned and undated dis-
course on the need of being loved, on the influ-
ence of nature, and the finding of God in soli-
tude.

 

One poem to Mlles. Marie and Adéle Donnet

also has no signature nor date. There is one
poem signed by a Wm. Joseph and another love
poem which seems to be in the same handwriting.

Some of the most interesting are "Letters
on Guadeloupe," addressed to "Lucile." The

 
/
Soulé, Pierre 10!

poems are interspersed with descriptions of life
on Guadeloupe, the slaves, Creoles, social cus-
toms, ete. The last has at the end a statement
that Guadeloupe was the birthplace of Léonard,
formerly well-known poet. It is probable that
these "letters" are copied from some of the

 

poems and writings of Nicolas-Germain Léonard,
poet of the 18th century, who was born in Guade-
loupe, educated in France where he spent many
years, but who kept returning to his beloved
Guadeloupe where he died in 1793.

 
Soulé, Pierre 11

The last document of this collection is a
long critical article by Ch. L on the per-
sonality and poetry of Adrien Rouguante. Adrien
and Dominique Ro ette were perhaps the best-

 

known poets of thé day in Louisiana. A letter
from Emile Deschamps, a French poet, to Domin-

ique in 1859 speaks highly of their work. Both
belonged to the romantic school, as did Des-
Champs himself. This article should be of value
to one interested in the poetry of the mid-nine-
teenth century in America,

South. Carolina Federation of Labor. Papers.
Charleston, Charleston Co., S.C.

 

The South Carolina Federation of Labor (AFL) was or-
@nized on Oct. 26, 1914, in Columbia by fifty-four dele-
gates from thirty local unions. The purpose of this
organization is "to agitate such questions as may be for
the benefit of the working classes and mankind in general

in order to obtain such legislation as will be beneficial
to them and to oppose all objective and unjust laws."
Officers were elected at this first meeting, C. L. Wilson
being elected as the first president. Resolutions

 
South Carolina Federation of Labor

 

concerning a compulsory education bill, the barbers
license law, twice-a-month pay day, and a law providing
for air brakes on street cars were passed at the initial
meeting.

Annual conventions of the South Carolina Federation of
Labor are held in various cities throughout the state.
By the time of its second convention, the Federation had

expanded to include sixty delegates from forty-five local
unions. In these conventions many matters are touched
upon, such as laws pertaining to education. The Federa-
tion has continued to grow, especially in the 1920s, when

 
South Carolina Federation of Labor

 

the textile employees began to affiliate with the Federa-
tion after they were organized. More details concerning
the history of the Federation may be found in the
Proceedings of the 16th Annual Convention of the South
Carolina Federation of Labor (1930) in the printed mater-
ial of this collection.

The correspondence, although spanning the years 1931

 

 

to 1947, is primarily the files of Aloysius Flynn as

President of the South Carolina Federation of Labor from
1940 to 1942. An@mployee at the U.S. Naval Shipyard in
Charleston, Flynn has had an active and varied career in

 
South Carolina Federation of Labor

 

the labor union field. For biographical information, see
the 3lst Annual Convention, South Carolina Federation of
Labor, p. 53 (June 27, 1946) in the printed material with
this collection.

There are some letters in the correspondence also of
Fred E, Hatchell, Secretary-Treasurer of the Federation.
The topics discussed in the correspondence are quite

 

miscellaneous in nature, including conventions, resolu-
tions, union meetings, subscription books, and a judicial
appointment.

In the printed material and miscellany is a series of
convention proceedings of the Federation from 1928 to

 
South Carolina Federation of Labor

 

1953. Included also are convention proceedings of the
Tennessee Federation of Labor in 1950. Other printed
items are reports, reviews, and convention yearbooks of
the South Carolina Federation.

The two serial publications with this collection are
The South Carolina Federationist (the official endorsed
organ of the Federation, published in Columbia) and The
Boilermakers Journal (official organ of the International
Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders and
Helpers of America, published in Kansas City, Kansas).
The volume is the Roster of Officers and Delegates of

 

 

 
South Carolina Federation of Labor

 

the Metal Trades Council, 1919-1921, Charleston, S.C. It
also contains two pages of expenses and receipts for
1921. (This volume was missing, 3-23-84)

Since this collection has not been cataloged in detail,
the entries made for the Autograph File may be incomplete.
Correspondence usually was indexed when there was a signi-
ficant number of letters for a person throughout the
collection, Only general subject entries have been made.

Papers, 1860's-1880's

Petersburg, Dinwiddie County, Virginia

2 items & 2 vols.

 
South Side Rail Road Company. Papers. Peters-
burg, Dinwiddie Co., Va.

 

The South Side Rail Road Company was first
chartered by the state of Virginia in 1846 to
build a line westward from Petersburg into
Nottoway County. The charter was amended in
1849 and 1850 to permit extensions to Burkeville

and to Lynchburg. The railroad was completed
between Petersburg and Lynchburg in 1854. Also
in 1854 the company purchased the City Point
Railroad from the city of Petersburg. This

 
South Side Rail Road Company 2
route ran eastward from Petersburg to City Point
on the James River. The City Point Railroad

was chartered in 1836, ran its first train in
1838, was unsuccessful, and was purchased by the
city of Petersburg in 1847 and renamed the Ap-
pomattox Railroad. In 1870 the South Side, Nor-
folk and Petersburg, Virginia and Tennessee, and

 

Virginia and Kentucky railroads were consolidat-
ed into the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Rail-
road Company that provided a continuous line be-
tween Norfolk and Bristol. In 1881 the A. M. &

 
South Side Rail Road Company 2

 

O. was sold and re-organized as the Norfolk and
Western. William Mahone, whose papers are in
the Manuscript Department, was president of
both the South Side and the A. M. & O. His pa-
pers should be consulted. Information on the
history of the South Side Rail Road is in
Herbert Clarence Bradshaw's History of Prince

 

Edward County, Virginia. The existence of the
Appomattox Railroad is documented in James G.
Scott and Edward A. Wyatt's Petersburg's Story,
A History, p. 96. The spelling of the South

 

 

 
South Side Rail Road Company 4

 

Side Rail Road Company's name is based upon an
1858 broadside (listed in Southeastern Broad-
sides Before 1877) and notations in the manu-
script volumes.

The Stockholders Register apparently dates
from 1870, for the date of Sept. 16, 1870, is
written on a summary sheet attached to the in-

 

 

side front cover. The Register records the
names of stockholders and the number of votes
entitled to be cast by each stockholder. _ Such
a complete list would have been needed when the

 
South Side Rail Road Company 5
railroad was merged into the A. M. & O. in 1870.
There were 13,710 shares and 4,371 votes. The
two largest stockholders were the state of Vir-
ginia (8,035 shares) and the city of Petersburg
(3,000). The town of Farmville (124 shares) was
among the stockholders. Many individuals were
also stockholders. Among them were David Dunlop
and David B. Tennant whose tobacco manufactory
records are part of the British-American Tobacco
Co. Papers.
The Bondholders Register was apparently in

 

 
South Side Rail Road Company 6

 

use during the 1860's and 1870's. Dated nota-
tions are 1869-1875. The dates listed with the
bonds are their future due dates, 1862-1900.

Dates of

issue and dates of the accounts are

usually not provided. The accounts are entered
mostly under the names of persons and corporate
bodies that owned the bonds. There is one sec-

tion for
of bonds
for both
pomattox

 

specific bond issues. Numerous issues
are represented in the volume. Issues
the South Side Rail Road and the Ap-

Railroad are numerous. Notable bond-
South Side Rail Road Company

holders include Randolph-Macon College, the city
of Petersburg, David B. Tennant, and Judge
Thomas Ruffin of Hillsborough, N.C. The ac-
counts contain columns for (not all of them are
always used): number of bond, amount of the
bond, when due, rate of interest, number and
amount of each coupon, aggregate of coupons,

 

aggregate bonds and coupons, amount guaranteed
bonds, and amount unguaranteed bonds.

The two items are lists of stocks and bonds.
One of these items is a list of bond issues,

 
South Side Rail Road Company 8
1868-1877, one of which is Appomattox River
Bonds of 1877. The latter bonds may relate to
the Upper Appomattox Company or the Lower Ap-
pomattox Company that were for many years re-
sponsible for keeping the Appomattox River nav-
igable. The other item (1880's?) is a computa-
tion with dates in the 1880's that may be either
actual dates or perhaps a projection only.

Southey, Robert. Papers. Keswick, Cumberland,
England

 

Robert Southey (1774-1843), English poet and
author, was born at Bristol and lived much of
his life at Keswick. He was associated with
Coleridge, Lowell, Scott, Byron, and other
prominent literary men of his day. Aside from
short tenures of clerical posts and pensions in
later years, his income was derived chiefly
from his pen. In this connection, he had
rather large responsibilities for the support
of his own family and for a period of time was
the chief dependence eS Coleridge's wife and

 
Southey, Robert
family.

His writing, both prose and poetry, was
voluminous, and he contributed to various
literary journals. His letters, two of which
have been published, deal with personal,
literary, financial, and publication matters.
One discusses the question of government

 

subsidy for authors and literary men. Several
pages of literary notes, some of the letters,
and two pictures of Southey are bound into a
small volume which also includes a brief
description of its contents.

One of the Neo contains informa-

 
Southey, Robert 3

 

tion on the history of the use of the fork,
while two others are quotations from "L,
Leonardo" and "B. Leonardo.” each accompanied
by volume and page references. A third and
fourth are quotations from deTocqueville [7]
and Menander respectively.

The most informative of the letters is

dated March 16, 1797, and mentions the "Welsh
Invasion & Bank stoppage," the fact that
Southey is about to send his “Joan of Arc" to
Paris, his daily routine of work including the
study of law and various foreign languages,

 
Southey, Robert 4
and an account of the English coinage of
Spanish dollars under the direction of William
Pitt. In connection with this last he speaks
of Gimbernatt as a friend of Carlyle and adds
that Las Casas is a “fine Spaniard -- a man

who seems to have ingrafted the new French
character on the old Spanish one."

 

A second letter, dated Dec. 26, 1829, was
written from Keswick and concerns his History
of Brazil.

The letter from Caroline Southey was
written (1840) to L. T. Pilgrim after Southey's

 
Southey, Robert

 

health had failed. She explained that a
volume of poems which Pilgrim had sent to her
husband was much appreciated and enjoyed but
that “an organic disease of the brain” prevents
his writing to acknowledge the gift.

8,items added, 11-23-43: Letters from the
early period of Southey's life and addressed

to Thomas Philips Lamb of Rye, Sussex. The
chief content of the letters is light and
humorous verse addressed to this friend, but
there is also a great deal of extremely
valuable comment on the French Revolution, most

 
Southey, Robert

of it indicating Southey's abhorence of the
violent turn it was taking. One letter,
apparently written in the fall of 1792, expresses
the writer's disappointment at being rejected at
Christ Church (probably due to his having been
expelled from Westminster) and his plans for
entering Balfiol. The last letter of this

 

group, dated June 13, 1798, alludes to his
marriage, his study of law, his literary
aspirations, etc.

mons (1863-1914), educator and musician; of his
grandson, JamesSouthgate Jones (b. 1888); and of
various friends and relatives.

The correspondence prior to 1851 contains
none of James Southgate's (1832-1914) hut con-
sists of letters of older members of the family.
The bulk of the correspondence in this period

 

consists of personalletters Brom Myra Ann Muse
both before and after her marriage to James Sum-
merville Southgate as well as some letters from

Harriet Sophia Southgate describing students!
balls at Williamsburg, Virginia, 1n1817 and in

 
SOUTHGATE ~-3~

1836, the panic of 1837, and Williamsburg. An
earlier letter, from 8, Southgate in London, 1794
containspersonal and family gossip. Most inter-
esting of the earlier letters are from Philip
DuVal to Charles Curtis, relatives of the South-
gates. Writing from Pike Co., Mo., and Yazodo.,
Miss., during the 1830's, DuVal's few letters

 

give interesting descriptions of Pike and Yazoo
counties, The majority of these earlier letters
were written to Mrs. Mary Southgate of Little

Plymouth, King and Queen Co., Va.
From 1850 to 1914, the collection centers

 
SOUTHGATE -4-

around James Southgate (1832-1914); his wife,
Delia Haywood (Wynne) Southgate (1826-88); and
their children, Beginning in 1851 there are
Latin exercises, letters of James Southgate while
he was at the University of Virginia, and letters
from hidfwignds waxxs still in college giving
news of activities at the University of Va. The

familyetters in this period were generally con-
nected with Lbcust Cottage, the home of James 8,
Southgate in King and Queen Co., where he and

his wife conducted a young ladies' finishing
school unt1] 1855 when they moved to Norfolk and

 
SOUTHGATE ~-5-

wbhth their son, James Southgate, and one Doggett
conducted the Cumberland Street School. Delia
Haywood Wynne came to the Cumberland Street
School as a teacher apparently also in 1855. Be
ginning in 1856 there is a series of correspond-
ence of great bulk lasting until Aug. 4, 1858,
from Jas, Southgate to his future wife, Delia
Haywood Wynne. This chandestine correspondence
contains many amusing instances of difficulties
of communication between the two young teachers,

Though in the same school, their letters are
réstricted in a large measure to plans for

 

 
SOUTHGATE -6-

seeing each other and for secreting their let-
ters in such placea as the seventh volume of
Fraser's Magazine. Many of James Southgate's
letters wepe undated. Letters of this period
between other members of the Sotitthgate family
contain comments on religious life, yellow fever
epidemics, and school troubles in Norfolk, Va.
Included also are a few letters from Ljewellyn
Southgate, brother of Jas. Southgate, while the
former was attending the J. of Ya,

After the marriage of Jas. Southgate and
Delia Wynne on Aug. 4, 1858, correspondence

 

 
Southgate -7-

 

practically ceases until 1861 when Jas. South-
gate enlisted in the Confed. Army for a term to
expire June 4, 1862. Llewellyn Southgate also
enlisted, serving at Chapin's Bluff, Petersburg,
and Hicksford, all in Va., at least until the
end of 1863, if not longer. His letter of May
30, 1862 speaks of the defeat of Gen. Lawrence

O'Bryan Branch near Ashland, Va. This letter
also comments on Confederates firing on Federal
ironclads on the James River. On Dec. 17, 1862

he writes that the departments of government in
Richmond are filled with disabled soldiers,

 
Southgate - 7A-

 

Evidently James Southgate left the army when
his term of enlistment ended. During most of
his enlistment James Southgate served at Sew-
ell's Point near Norfolk, Va. Meanwhile, Delia
(Wynne) Southgate attempted to carry on the
school. Correspondence in this period is not
extensive, usually coming from James

 
SOUTHGATE -8—
Southgate and describing army life.

Apparently Southgate, upon leaving the Army
in 1862, went to Louisburg, N.C., to head the
Louisburg Female Gollege. The collection conta
practically no correspondence relative tothis
period, but by 1867 with their removal to Olin,
N.C., where Southgate became "President and
Commissioner of the Olin Agricultural and Me-
chanical College," a school apparently not even
in existence at the time, the correspondence

again begins, In 1867 Southgate went to New
York to raise money for the Olin Agricultrral

 

 
SOUTHGATE ~9-—

and Mechanical College, leavinghis wife and
children in Olin, To raise the money for beginning
the college, Southgate, while in New York, engagpi
in numerous enterprises such as handling produce
for a commission merchant, selling subscriptions
to magazines, selling organs and pianos, selling
Masonic literature, speculating on tickets to a

 

lecture by Charles Dickens, and numerous other
efforts. In November, 1867, Southgate appears
to have taken an agency for a life insurance

S6mpGty although he seems to have remained in

 
SOUTHGATE ~-10~-

New York some time further. Southgate's letters
to his wife from New York ‘nclude a weaakth of
material onlife in the metropolis including
plans for mding money, crpwds-at Dickens' lect=
ures, the work of Charle& FofDeems, and an under
current of interest in making money. Apparently
Southgate, from the influence of this brief stay

 

in New York deserted plans for a college at Olin
and turned @xclusively to insurance,
The Southgates left Olin for Hillsboro, N.C,,

apparently in 1871 when Southgate seems to have
handled Masonic literature inonjunction with

 
SOUTHGATE ~1l-~
insurance. By 1877, he moved to Durham and as
agent for the Old Dominion Insurance Company as
well as other firms wecame comfortably situated.
With the exception of a number of interesting
letters bearing on reconstruction in North Caro-
lina written to hiw wife in 1871, the corre~
spondence contains few of Southgate's letters be-
tween 1871 and 1883. An illness in 1883 carried
him to Richmond, Virginia, for treatment. From
there he wrote of personal and business affairs,

equests relative to news of neighbors in Durham,

 

pnd of his ailments and gastronamic prefersances,.

 
SOUTHGATE ~12~

By that time Southgate's son, James Haywood
Southgate, had become a member of his father(s
insurance agency after having spent two years at
the University of North Carolina. Apparently
the younger Southgate soon essumed chief responsi-
bility for the businesswhich he greatly expanded,
After 1888, letters of the elder Southgate were

 

written chiefly while he wag spending his summers
at Saratoga Springs, Chautauqua, and Stamford,
all in New York State. They form an interesting
Sefies of letters containing comments on the
hotel guests, service, his deughters, Mattie

 
SOUTHGATE ~13-
Logan (Southgate) Jones and Celestia Muse (South
gate) Simmons, who frequently accompanied him,
visits mafe to Va. relatives while en route to
New York, and current affairs in general. In
SkeeertetiexrshexfirequankiyxakeadxxxxxxxXxxxxxx
these letters he asked about people of Durham or
told of conversations with Durhamites he met in
the North.

The letters of James Southgate span a period
of approximately sigty-five years and contain a

 

wealth of comment on soctal matters, They re-
veal an intimate tnowledge of English literature

 
SOUTHGATE -14-

as well as the curiosity of an antiquarian especi:

ally with reference to his Virginia ancestry and

Virginia history in general. Many of his letters
to a cousin, "Anna," were returned, evidently to
is daughter, and with her replies the questions
nder discussion are verv clear, He included

hittle in these letters relative to his insurance

 

business, but for information on the University
of Virginia, educational questions, family
affairs, New York State resorts, early phases of
the Civil War, and genealogy of his family

Pouthgate's correspondence is excellent.

 
SOUTHGATE ~15-
letters are well written and reveal a well
trained mind,

James Haywood Southgate (1859-1916) contribu te
relatively few letters to the collection, his
correspondence inn general being confined to
periods of family stress when sickness and death
occured, There are, however, many letters rela~

 

tive ‘to the insumzane business but they are gen-
erally to Southgate. More important are a ser-
hes of interesting letters from Edwin Mims and

to Southgate reveal the high esteem in which he
was generally held, with comments on his oratori
cal ability, his interest in civic affairs, his
general culture, and th e hospitality extended

known as Southgate's Cabin, James Haywood South
gate died in the very prime of his career only
two years after his father's death,

sisterof James H, Southgate,was widowed early
in her married life, and with her children (only

One, Southgate Jones, survived to manhood) lived

in close contact with her father and brother,
Many papers and much correspondence cemher around
her, consisting of letters from her school mates
and friends, genealogical studies of the Jones
and Southgate families, letters relative to va=
rious mineral ores and stones which she collected
copies of speeches delivered usually before civic

 

Clubs, and many letters of sympathy on the deaths
of her husband, her sister, her sons, her father,
and her brother. Most interesting of the letters
to Mattie Logan (Southgate) Jones are those from

her cousin, Geo. M. Bailey, editor of the Houston

 
SOUTHGATE -19-

Texas) Post, relative to family affairs and the
growth of Texas, There are also a number of let
ters to her son, Southgate Jones, written genera
ally when in the North With her father. Materia
concerned with her activities reveals her as a
most important and active civic leader in Durhan,
interested in church work, education, club work,
woman suffrage, and civit betterment in general.
During her later years she ment muck time com-

leting the genealogicalwork started by her

father, Many letters demonstrate the esteem
4n which she was held ‘n Durham by the citizens

 

 
SOUTHGATE -20—

and by Duke University as well as in other areas
of North Carolina, Few outstanding functions
were held in Piedmont North Carolina during the
later years of her life to which she was not
invited as a special guest of honor. She carried
on the interests of her father,

Al though the collection ¢ontains fewer of the
letters of Celestia Muse (Southgate) Simmons
[generally known as Lessie] they reveal her as
& capable and resourceful teacher, musician, and
traveler, FB a time after her nearly student

ays and after two years of teaching in a

sister and her father. Some of her letters were
written while shw was on concert tours, while

in New York or Paris studying music, and while
traveling in Europe or around the world with her
husband. Her letters, however, are not numerous
Her death also came while her career was at its
hei zht,.

 

The last generation of the family to leave
letters of any consequence in this collection
was J. Southgate Jones (b.1888), son of Thomas

Decatur Jones and Mattie Logan (Southgate) Jones,

 
SOUTHGATE -23-
Young Southgate Jones' letters wegin when he was
quite youthful, but the bulk of them was written
while he was a student at Bingham School in Ashe
iile, N. C., and contain a wealth of material o
life at Bingham School. Written with extreme
frankness relative to his studies and social ac-
tivities, his letters are interesting and valu-

 

eble, often savoring of Booth Tarkington's Penrod
The letters of Delia Haywooé (Wynne) South~
Bzte (1826-88) were generally to her husband and

Oontain descriptions of her young children
and something of the schools in whi chbhe ard

 
SOUTHGATE -24~

er husband were interested. In the collection
also are numerous letters from her brother, Thos,
K. Wynne (b. ca. 1821), a newspaper editor of
Columbus, Ga. His letters, generally well writ-
ten, contain accounts of his family, references
to poverty-stricken years after the Civil War,
and national questions, Among the correspondence
connected with the family of Delia Wynne South-
gate there are several from J. Robert Jeffreys,
sually relative to family and agricultural ques-

tions, written from Eureka, N.C.; Delia was the

 

 
SOUTHGATE -25~
daughter of Robert H.Wynne andSusan Battle (Jef
freys) Wynne, the latter having been descended
from Osborn Jeffreys, one of the most prominent
colonial landholders in eastern North Carolina,
There are also a few letters a@ members of the
Perry family of Franklin County, N.C., this
family also doubtless being connected with the
Jeffreys,

Among the pavers are 16 letters and 6 enve~
lopes not conngected with the Southgate family.

These papers, connected with Pleasant B, Trice,
Harry S.Baker, Sarah Tillinghast, and D. W.

Walter Clark and James H. Southgate were

trustees of Trinity College; Walter Clark
writes on June 25, 1898, for information from
the minutes of the Brustees of Trinity College:
Dr. Kilgo andJudge Clark had differed; Kilgo
instigated an investigation committee; Clark

 
SOUTHGATE -31-

was requested to resign on June 15, 1898 by

the Trustees of Trinity. Clark blames the

Duke family for causing his ousting, chiefly
because of his letter of July 14, 1897,
denouncing the Duke "illegal" trusts. Judge
Clark reviews popular views on taxation for the
common schools and the stand of the Trinity

 

Trustees on this question. He also quotes
Kilgo's statements on the greatness of Washing-
ton Duke and characterizes Kilgo's personality
and his relation of "over-lord" to Trinity
Trustees. All this in involved in charsges

 
SOUTHGATE =338-
against President Kilgo.

 

Southgate, as president of the Board of
Trustees, replies on July 7, 1898, that that
body would investigate the charges Clark had
hurled at Kilgo. He also asks Dr. L. W.
Crawford to come before the Trustees to

explain his editorial in the N. C. Advocate.
Testimony was gathered in N. @U. and S. C.,

ment of the Turstees' meeting to give
Walter Clark more time to present proof of his
charges.

and a daughter, Vharlotte. Returning to
Washington in 1844, she taught in the public
schools there, in spite of her i111 health
and the illness of her children. While so
occupied she began to write stories, the
first of which, ahe Irish petpeee appeared

 

in the Baltimore Sa aturday isitor r. Subsequent-
ly, she wrote for the National =r ra, and
became a regular contributor. In its columns

appeared her first novel, Retribution, which

was originally intended to be a short story,
but grew into a novel and was issued in book
form in 1849, With unusual rapidity she
wrote her succeeding stories, issuing some-
times as many as three a year. Her works
disply strong dramatic power and contain

 

many excellent déscriptive passages of south-
ern life and scenery, to which they are
chiefly devoted. She moved in 1853 to

Prospect Cotbage, Georgetown, D. C. where she

she lived until 1876, when she moved to
Yonkers, N. Y. Mrs. Southworth's novels
number about sixty and many were republished
in London, Paris, Leipzig, Madrid and Montreal.
Many of her stories appeared serially in the

New York Ledger. Among her best known works
are: The Fatal Secret, Unknown, Gloria, The
Trail of the Serpent, Nearest and Dearest,
and The Mother's Secret. The Hidden Hand

Southworth to Robert Bonner, editor of the
New York Ledger. In 1857 she entered a
contract by which all her stories were to be
published first in the Ledger. Some were later
sold to T. B. Peterson of Philadelphia and
Bublished in novel form. The stories were
evidently well received both in the U. 5S.

and in England, and although she was employed

letters from a soldier in Company F, 4th Ky.

He entered the service in January, 1862 and took
his basic training at Camp Morton near Bard-
stown, Ky. His letters give many insights into

 

camp life. rad company was transferred to Camp

Wood, Mumfordgville, Ky., the last of March.
Here arms were issued but only one company
accepted them and they were hissed by the rest
of the soldiers. Shortly after, they marched to

Nashville where they did picket duty and went
On scouting expeditions. While here they had

a fight with Morgan's gang who had been robbing
both the North and the South. He spent several
months during the summer at Shelbyville and
Nashville, Tenn., convalescing from an illness.
In August he returned to his company at Steven-
son, Ala., where they occasionally talked with
Confederate soldiers camped across the Tennes-
see River. The company was transferred to
Bowling Green, Ky., during the Fall. Here they
engaged in scouting expeditions. Camo life was

 

 
Sowle, Charles H, 3
fairly satisfactory at this time. In December,
18623 the company was paid for six months and
many of the men went home as deserters. On
January 26, 1863 he wrote from Bowling Green
that he was strongly considering deserting
after the next pay day; things were a "mixed
up mess" in the camp and the troops were

 

completely demoralized. The company left
Bowling Green for the front in February with
only 17 men. The company with a few additional
men was engaged in a battle near Franklin, Tenn

had no casualties but lost about half of its
horses to the Confederates. It spent the spring
end summer of 1863 in Tenn. and Ga. Usually

the fighting was only patrol skirmishing and
attacks on picket posts. However, during
September the company was badly defeated by

the Confederates with the loss of 15 men in the

 

company and 81 in the regiment. The company then
occupied a former infentry camp near Chattanooga
Guring the spring of 1864 where the men were
putting "convalescer® horses" into battle con-
dition. By summer the comoany was tack in battle

in Georgia. A letter of August 2 tells of the
drunkenness among officers in the camp at
Lafayette, Ga. He cautioned his parents not to
mention it at home because some folks might
not appreciate it. Many men in his company had
been sent to the mills. The remainder were
destroying all the property, and robbing and
plundering freely in this town.

There are only a few other letters in the
collection including several from Charles's
brother, 0. S. Sowle, who was serving on a

poral in Company K, 3rd Wisconsin Volunteers,
during the Spanish-American War. Items from
this period are letters to a Miss Lulu Scott

and a diary covering the period from April 28
