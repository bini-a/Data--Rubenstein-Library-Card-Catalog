Sergeant Nate Lanpheur writes two letters in
the summer of 1863 from the garrison at Plymout
N. C., where his regiment, the 85th NY. Vols.,
is stationed. These letters to L. C. Newton, a
friend, reflect Civil War conditions at home in
Alleghany Co., N. Y., as well as describe the

U. S. Army and Navy forces in Washington Co. on
the Roanoke River on Albemarle Sound, This is
the 18th Corps in the Department of N. C., U.S.
Army, under Gen, Henry W. Wessells. The garri-
son was having an easy time in 1863, so Lanpheur

 
Lanpheur, N.
comments on what will happen to the War Depart-

ment if U. S. Grant "is beaten" at Vicksburg,
Miss. He mentions the wild time in Alleghany
Co. when the 23rd and 27th N. Y. Vols. are mus-
tered out in June, 1863. He also complains that
the garrison is not large enough to risk a bat-
tle outside its fortifications. Guerillas are

 

active around Plymouth, and on Aug. 9, 1863,

he tells of the burning of the lighthouse nearby
by these bands, the capture of some of them by
the 103rd Pa., and the subsequent imprisonment
of guerilla leaders. ry interested in con-

scription in N. Y., saying conscripts from El-
mira will be welcomed into his regiment. Heat,
mosquitoes, and fever plague these northern
troops. Roanoke Island and Little Washington,

N. C., are the other two northern bases mention-
ed.

 

The third item of this collection was

written after the close of the Civil War, when
Lanpheur had returned from a southern prison.
His narrative is a memoir of the seige and fall
of Plymouth, Apr. 17-20, 1864, to the Confede-
rate forces under a we F. Hoke. U. S.

 
Lanpheur, N, 4
Army troops at Plymouth included, besides the
85th N. Y. and the 103rd Pa., the 10lst Pa., the
96th N. Y., the 24th N. Y. Battery, the 12th

N. Y. Cavalry, the 16th Conn., Negro troops in
Gen. Wild's Brigade, the 2nd Mass. Heavy Artil-
nar and two companies of loyal North Carolini-

 

ans (called Buffaloes by the Confederates).

This garrison of 2500 men is reinforced by ma-
rines on gunboats in the river. Lanpheur gives
a description of the semi-circle of breastworks,
redoubts, forts, and bombproofs around the town.
Meanwhile he refers “eo about a Confederate

 
Lanpheur, N. 5
ram being constructed up the Roanoke River. The
winter of 1863-1864 was quiet, with deserters,
contrabands, and refugees coming into Plymouth.
But on Apr. 17, 1864, Hoke's troops surrounded
the town, fierce fighting takes place, and the
ram comes down the river to burst through the
Miami and the Smithfield, while the other gun-

 

 

boats flee down the Sound. The garrison sur-
renders to become prisoners of war, only one
third of whom survived.

24 items added on 11-19-57. These items
consist mainly of Union soldiers' letters writ-

 
Lanpheur, N. 6

 

ten in various places in Va. in 1862-1864. The
better items are those discussing the Peninsula
Campaign (1862). The skirmish at Deserted House
Suffolk, Va. (Jan. 30, 1863), and the Battle of
Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863) are also mentioned.
The Confederate Army of Northern Va. is mention-
ed and so are the following Federal Army units:

the Army of the Potomac, Hooker's Division, Han=
cock's Brigade, Peck's Brigade, the 85tn, Regt. ,
the 16th Regt. of Me., the 13th Regt. of N. Y.
Vols., the 2nd Regt. Me. Mounted, and the Boston

Light Artillery.

 
Lanpheur, N.

 

Confederate Gens. mentioned include R. E. Lee
and William Henry Fitzhugh ("Rooney") Lee. A
letter of June 29, 1863, mentions the capture
of "Rooney" and other Confederates.

Federal Gens. mentioned include Nathaniel P.
Banks, Ambrose E. Burnside, John G. Foster,
George B. McClellan, and George G. Meade.

Other names which occur in the collection
include Jefferson Davis (a letter of Oct. 8,
1862, quotes a Negro woman to the effect that
he is the father of her almost white child);
Horatio Seymour; and a Federal Col. Belknap,

 
Lanpheur, N. 8

 

who is perhaps William Worth Belknap. A letter
of July 8, 1862, speaks ill of the Colonel.

Several letters (e. g., Aug. 11, Oct. 8, and
Nov. 9 & 21, 1862) discuss the political issues
of the war, Abraham Lincoln, the U. S. Congress,
and the Emancipation Proclamation.

Other matters mentioned are Federal deserters
and Confederate and Federal prisoners, casualties
and troop movements.

Washington, D. C.

Robert Lansing (1864-1928), a distinguished
American attorney, was Secretary of State in
President Wilson's cabinet during 1915-1920.
Three volumes contain typescripts, often with
handwritten corrections, of a book about
American political parties, an article on

 

sovereignty, and twenty-one addresses and
articles from World war I and its aftermath.
During 1898-1910, Lansing wrote the
manuscript of a book entitled “Principles of
American Political Parties" which he revised

 
Lansing, Robert 2
about 1913 or 1914. The text covered U. S.
politics until 1857. The chapter titles are:
I-Individualism and Nationalism; II-The Rise
and Fall of Federalism; IlI-The Jeffersonian
Theory; IV-The Democratic-Republican Supremacy};
V & VI-The Jacksonian Period; Vil-Van Buren
and the Finances; VIII-The Whig Administration;
IX-Slavery, Abolition, and Sectionalism;
X-A Jeffersonian Administration; XI&XII-The
Period of Compromises.

He published several articles on sovereignty
that were reprinted in Notes on Sovereignty

 

 

 
Lansing, Robert 3
From the Standpoint of the State and of the
World (Washington, 1921). He apparently
planned another article in which the relation-
ship of sovereignty to territory was to be
investigated. A manuscript volume of 1910
includes a draft or notes for the article.
Citations and quotations from other authors
are given.

A volume contains the typescripts of twenty-
one addresses and articles written during 1918-
1920. They are itemized by title in the
Autograph File. Generally they concern U. S.

participation in World War I, the Peace
Conference, and the postwar international
order. Some of the addresses pertain to U. S.
relations with Latin America during this period

This ledger of 1823-1828 belongs with the
account books that are attributed to the firm
of Samuel M. Lantz and J, P. Rinker. The ledger
lacks any notation about its owners. However,
entries in the Lantz and Rinker Daybook, 1825-

1826, can be traced into the ledger's accounts.
The ledger has not survived intact, and its re-
maining folios are numbered 36-218.

The prominence of the entries for bar iron
and the forge suggest that the owners of the

 
Lantz, Samuel M., and J. P. Rinker 2
ledger operated the Union Forge as well as a
general merchandise establishment. The ques-
tion of the ownership of the Union Forge is
discussed in John W. Wayland, A History of
Shenandoah County Virginia (Strasburg, Virginia,
1927), pp. 240-242, Union Forge was operating
as early as 1808 and continued until its de-

 

 

struction in 1864. After a freshet destroyed the
forge in 1844, Samuel Lantz and Israel Rinker
restored it.

A map on page 40 of Wayland's book shows the
location of Union Forge.

Sir William Owen Lanyon (1842-1887), British
colonial official, was administrator of the
Transvaal (1879-1881) and of Griqualand West
(1875-1878), and he served in the Egyptian
Campaign of 1882 and the Nile Expedition of

1884-1885. During 1873-1874 he was aide-de-
camp to Sir Garnet Wolseley in the Gold Coast

Lanyon, Sir William Owen
slavery.

This microfilm includes Vols. 1-8 and 10
of the 17 volumes of the Lanyon Papers. Vols.
1-8 & 10 primarily concern Lanyon's administra-
tion of Griqualand West and the Transvaal
during 1875-1881, and only a few documents
earlier and later relate to his work in

 

Jamaica, Egypt, and the Gold Coast.

John Whitfield Lapsley (1806-1889) was a law-
yer and property owner in Selma, Alabama. He
was a prominent promoter of railroad construc-
tion and was interested in the development of
the state's mineral resources. Biographical in-

formation appears in a Sketch of the Life of Col
John W. Lapsley by Hon. H. S. D. Mallory (4 pp.)
of which thers is a copy in the pamphlet collec-

tion. There is a Xerox copy of the pamphlet

 
Lapsley, John Whitfield 2
and also a typescript filed with the papers.

The principal item in the collection is an
autograph draft (14 pp.) of an appeal by Lap-
sley to the President and Congress of the Con-
federacy in hehalf of railroad construction
generally, and specifically for those lines lead-
ing out of Selma. It was written in the autum

 

of 1862, for there are references to General
Bragg's operations (p. 4), the expected assault
on Vicksburg (p. 14), and the fall crop season
(p. 8). The manuscript is unsigned, but the

 
Lapsley, John Whitfield 3
handwriting matches that in his letters of this
period.

There are, photographs of portraits of Lapsle
his wife, and son that were painted in the 18408
and 1850's by George Cook and Robert Troy.

A commission of 1883 was for the appointment
by the Governor of Georgia of J. B. Lapsley as
an officer in the Cave Spring Guards.

the papers of Daniel W. Lassiter, and the
second and third sections of the pavers of
Francis R. and Chas. Trotter Lassiter, res-
pectively. A large part of the Gorresvon-
Gence is of a routine nature. Much of it
concerns the career of Francis R. Lassiter
as a politician and congressman. A letter

written by Wm. Gordon McCabe in 1887 tells

Grover Cleveland, James G. Blaine, Wm. Mahone,
and the presidential campaign of 1888 are to
be found in a letter of July 6, 1888. At
least from 1890 to 1892 Francis Lassiter was

 

commander of the Petersburg Greys. There are
many letters for these years concerning the
Va. Militia. Other letters include one of
Jan. 1893 which advocates the building of a

Nicaraguan canal, a letter written later in

"Yankee Tom", a New Englander, reached
Puerto Rico in 1359. He was aided by the
American consul, George Latimer, to gain
entrance to the country without a passport.
On March 18, 19, and 21 he sent three letters

to a friend, Horace » presumably the
editor of the Beacon, with instructions
to edit them for publication. The letters

describe the seizure by the Spanish of a ship

bringing 1100 African slaves into the Carribean,
Ihe attitude of the Spanish authorities, the
fate of the ship, its crew, and the slaves,
as well as life in the old walled city of San
Juan, are described.

George Latimer had been an American
consul in San Juan, Puerto Rico, for many
years. He was retiring from that post a
wealthy man when Yankee Tom met him in San

James S. Lattner was a Justice of the
Inferior Court of Franklin County, Georgia.
During the Civil War he served as a first
lieutenant and Captain of Company C, 9th
Georgia Battalion. The surname is spelled

both as "Lattner" and "Latner" in this
collection.

The earliest item is a document, signed by
Governor Joseph E. Brown, commissioning

 
Lattner, James S. 2

 

Lattner as Justice of the Inferior Court in
Franklin County. The remainder of the papers
relate to the Civil War. There are two
documents in 1862. One of these, which is
endorsed by Lattner, granted a soldier in his
company a leave of absence. The other is a
statement by Lattner's doctor that he is unfit
to return to duty. Of interest is a letter
dated July 29, 1863, written to the Justices
of the Inferior Court of Franklin County by
John Bulow Campbell, Secretary of the Georgia

 
Lattner, James S.

 

Executive Department. Campbell forwarded
money for the relief of families of disabled
and deceased Confederate veterans. Included
is a schedule listing the categories of
persons entitled to such funds.

Henry Laurens (1724-1792) was born in
Charleston, S.C., studied in the colonies and
in London, and became the leading merchant of
his native city and later a prosperous planter.
He held several offices in the new state gov-

ernment of South Carolina and served as pres-
ident of the Continental Congress from 1777 to
1778.

On Aug. 17, 1777, John Laurens wrote to his
father to request that several books be mailed

 
Laurens, Henry 2
to him.

Thomas Burke, William Sharpe, and Samuel
Johnston, in a letter dated Jan. 16, 1781,
asked Laurens to support their suggestion that
the British navy and army be attacked from the
seacoast of N.C. They cited the need to free
N.C. from the restrictions imposed on trade and

 

transportation by English control. This item
was transferred from the Revolutionary
Collection.

Moses Young, Lauren's aide in Congress and
in Europe, wrote Laurens to ask him to certify

 
Laurens, Henry 3
Young's service to qualify him for compensation
from the government (June 16, 1792).

Lavallette, Elie A. F, Sketch (4)
This collection begins with the year
1826. The first letter is written by Laval-

lette to his wife, Mrs. Mary Lavallette,
while he was on board the U.S.S."Constitu-
tion" which was at that time docked at
Smyrna. He mentions his work briefly, but
devotes most of the letter to inquiries

 

about the children and to a description of
a little donkey which he has purchased for
his young son.

The period between 1826 and 1848 is the
richest in the number of family letters of

 
Lavallette, Elie A. F. Sketch (5)
any period covered by this set. Besides
those from Lavallette to his wife there
are some from Stephen, Lavallette's son,
to his father. One, dated Oct. 13, 1840,
describes Stephen's studies and progress
at the "Naval Asylum" at Philadelphia.
The 1847 and 1848 correspondence is,
as one would expect, largely in Spanish
and bears on Lavallétte's administration
as civil and military governor of Maza-
1an, which Mexican city he had captured.
Beginning in 1851 Lavallette was ag-

 

 
Lavallette, Elie A. F. Sketch (6)
Signed to patrol the African coast in or-
der to suppress the slave trade. During
this period of his service an American
seaman was held captive for about. nine
days by Selim, King of the island of Jo-
hanna. This naturally occasioned quite a
controversy between the American forces

 

under Pearson, and Selim, of which a com-
plete record may be found among the 1852
pepers. They run through the months of May
to August, and include the treaty bearing
Selim's signature in Arabic, dated Aug. 15.

 
Lavallette, Elie A. F. Sketch (7)
Another letter in this group which is
worthy of note is one from Joseph Jenkins
Roberts, president of Liberia, to Laval-
lette, asking him to help suppress a na-
tive uprising at Bassa.

The Mediterranean fleet's headquarters
were at Porto Praya in the Cape Verde Is-

 

lands. The abundance of correspondence in
Portuguese at this time seems to indicate
some sort of friction with the Portuguese
government--doubtless over the rates of
customs. Other than this the papers at

 
Lavallette, Elie A, F. Sketch (8)
this time are purely routine reports from
subordinate officers to Lavallette giving
amounts of powder, shot, and other types
of supplies on hand. There are also several
letters telling of disturbences necessi-
tating the presence of the American fleet.
Jan. 12, 1858, 1s the date of the first

 

piece of information bearing on the "Jaffa
affair" which involved the murder of sev-

eral American citizens at Jaffa, Syria, by
five Turks. Through some freak of Turkish
jurisprudence the trial of these men drag-

 
Lavallétte, Elie A. F, Sketch (9)
ged on for many months with frequently re-
curring references to.it in the corres=
pondence.

Lavallette was much interested in
systems of lighthouses, but, unfortunately,
the set @Gontains little information on this

matter. There 1s a "Table of lighthouses

 

on the Island of Sicily" dated July 11,
1859, and two pen and ink drawings of marine
telegranhs for day and night signalling.
There are two manuscript articles dated
Sept. 23, 1859, signed. by John Ghirsi [sp?d

 
Lavallette, Elie A, F, Sketch (10)
and exsplaining a new system of navigation
by hydraulic methods. These apparently
were sent to Lavallette in the hope of in-
teresting him as a patron in the scheme.

There are ten bound volumes which
should be used in conjumetion with the
loose papers of this set. Briefly, they
contain the following information.

1) Diary. 18290-1822. Actually a log book.
Contains observations on lengths of
voyages (S. Am.), wind shifts as com-
pared to earlier voyages over same

route. ;

William Law, Jr. (1792-1868), around
whom this collection centers, was the son
of William Law (1764-1812) and Mary (DuBose)
Law (1774-1834) of Georgetown District. Ap-
parently his grandfather was also named
William Law. According to his papers Wil-

liam Law, Jr. was a leading citizen in Dar-

 
LAW, WILLIAM Sketch ()

lington District being prominent as a plan-
ter, a merchant, and a leader of local mil-
itia. He was prominent also in the Presby-
terian Church, in local politics, in the Tem
perance movement, and in the building of the
Cheraw and Darlington Railroad. These papers
business and otherwise, show a close con-
nection between the Law and DuBose families
as well as with George Cooper, who married
Jane, the eldest sister of William Law, Jr.

Law was also in the lumber business with

 

 
LAW, William Sketch (3)

 

Cyrus Bacot at least from 1818 until 1830.
For a number of years Law and Daniel Du-
Bose operated a mercantile establishment
at Darlington Court House.

Perhaps the most interesting and de-
tailed records, though confined to the
relatively short period from 1813 to 1820,
are those concerned with Law's position as
captain of the -Black Creek militia. The
records include muster rolls, accounts of

court martials, and supplies lists of ab-

 
LAW, WILLIAM Sketch (4)
sentees with excuses of the culprits, and
numerous orders. Apparently Law was charg-
ed with the inculcation of sterner disci-
pline probably because of the War of 1812,
although the collection contains no reference
to the war.

Law's activities as a planter are not

 

very clearly revealed. There are, however,
frequent lists of slaves, accounts of cot-
ton planting and weights. of hogs kille

There are also lists of amounts of cotton

 
LAW, WILLIAM Sketch (5)
produced. In many cases, the large amounts
of cotton sold by Charleston merchants for
Law lead to the conclusion that he acted

as an agent for Charleston commission mer-
chants.

Law's activity as a merchant consti-

 

tutes perhaps the bulk of the papers. There
are numerous price lists and bills from
Charleston commission merchants. The
eighteen bound volumes accompanying the

papers are generally devoted to daily ac-

éounts Of the DuBose and Law mercantile
firm of Darlington Court House. Some of
the volumes contain the records of a lum-
ber business operated by Cyrus Bacot and
Law. References are made in the papers

to a boat owned by Law. Presumably DuBose
and Law shipped products to Charleston
on received goods in return. Law also

handled turpentine and bricks.

Sketch
William Augustus Law (d.1909), a Darling-
ton Co., &.C., planter, was the son of William
Law (1792-1868), whose papers constitute an-
other collection held by Duke Library. The
correspondence in this. collection concerns the

 

entire family until William's death in 1868,
when it centers about the affairs of his son,
The only letters of interest before 1868 are
school correspondence, There is an 1825 letter
from a young lady at Richmond Euphradian

 
a William Augustus 2

 

Academy complaining of the ever-recurring pro-
blem of examinations, and another letter from

a student at Converse College at Spartanburg
in 1844 continues the 014 story. An 1851 letter
from William Law to his daughters at Bradford
Springs Female Academy in Sumter Co., told of

a Presbyterian revival in progress at home.

The correspondence from 1868 to 1900 con-
cerns almost wholly, the plantation management
of William A., and the bulk of it was from
Charleston factor William K. Ryan, and commiss-
ion merchant “enry Cobia. These letters dealt

 
Law, William Augustus 3
with the cotton market and prices, contained
price bulletins during the 1870's, and reflect-
ed the bad conditions during the Reconstruction
period in §.C, Other agricultural matters dealt
with are the purchsse of new Watt plews by Law
in 1873-4, an offer by a fertilizer company to
make him egent in his area, and a dispute with
the Cheraw and Darlington Railroad in the
1880's over the killing of stock by trains on
the line through his property. Law also sold
wood to this comnany in the 1870's,

Virtually the only non-business letters

 

 
Law, William Augustus 4
tefore 1900 occurred when Law's wife, Julia,
visited her family. These contained routine
family news for the most part, but in 1872
William wrote her of a Grange meeting, and in
1874 told of a Methodist revival and of the
bitterness surrounding a local election. In
spite of the fact thst the Law family was a
very prominent one in §.C., the only relative
of some importance mentioned in the collection
was Hugh Lide Law in 1870.

After 1900 the correspondence involves
Julia and the children (Ted, Willie, Margaret,

 

 
Law, William Augustus Za §

and Edward R.) anc deals only with family news.
The collection also contains 569 bills and

receipts, some of which concerned L-w's sister,

Laura ,Zimmerman, There are some receinvts of

the 1870's from the Bradford Springs Female

Academy, Confederate $500 and $1,000 bonds,and

 

$10 and $20 bills (transferred to the Currency
and Bond Collection), and a C.S.A. Army pass
for William A., permitting him to return home
to secure a remount. A large part of the bills
and receipts after the war were from factor

Family correspondence of several members of
the Lawler family. The chief value of the let
ters lies in the enthusiastic accounts of the
fertility of western lands to which several of
the Lawlers had moved. The central figure of

the collection, Joseph Lawler, appears to be
the only static member of the family. Living
in Salem, Fauquier County, Virginia, he re-
ceived in 1820 letters from his father, Nicho-
las Lawler, in Shelby Co., Kentucky and from

 
Lawler, Joseph
1834-1860, letters from his son, Elisha, in
Anderson Town, Madison Co., Indiana. There
are a few letters from other Lawlers whose
relationship to the family is not made com-
pletely clear.

Almost all of the letters quote food and
commodity prices for Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio,
and Indiana between 1820 and 1860. There are
also occasional references to social,
political, and religious (especially of the
Baptist Church) activities in those states.

Stringer Lawrence (1697-1775), British army
officer, is known as the "father of the Indian
army.'"' During 1748-1759 he played a principal
role in the defeat of the French and their
allies in southern India and in the consolida-
tion of British influence and control. A

description of his career is in the Dictionary
of National Biography.

The treaty at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 did
not end the struggle between England and France
in India where the French under Dupleix and

 

 

 
Lawrence, Stringer 2
General Law were almost successful in absorb-
ing the whole of the Carnatic. Lawrence and
Dupleix supported rival claimants to the throne
of the Carnatic. Warfare raged throughout the
region until 1755 when the French signed a
treaty that conceded the main points of the con-
test to the British and destroyed the work of

 

Dupleix. Except for an absence in England in

1750-1752, Lawrence commanded the British forces

with the able assistance of Robert Clive.
Lawrence described the events of this war in

 
Lawrence, Stringer 3

“A Narrative of Affairs on the Coast of Coro-
mandel from 1730 to 1754" that was published as
the first part of the History of the War in
India (London, 1759), compiled by Richard Owen
Cambridge. A manuscript (140 pp.) copy of the
"Narrative," dated Oct. 23, 1755, at Ft. St.
George, is signed by Stringer Lawrence. There
are many textual variations from the edition

 

 

published at Dublin in 1761 (copy in Rare Books)
Most of the text concerns the events of!1752-
1754 after Lawrence's return from England. He

summarized events from 1730 to 1752. At the
end of the volume there is a description of
the island of Seringam (8 pp.).

of the manuscript. A positive microfilm copy is

The papers of James H.C. Leach, a Presbyter-
ian minister, consist largely of letters from
his two sons, Richard and James, his daughter,
Sue, and their relatives.

By 1847 James was a student at Washington Col

 

lege (Washington and Lee) anda Richard, an alumn
of Washington College, was a medical student at
the University of Maryland (Baltimore). The cor
respondence between the brothers and hetween
them and their family provide a Slimpse of stud-
ent life at each of the institutions, Too,

 
Léach, James H.C.
something of the curriculum of the medical schod
along with general information significant for a
history of the University of Maryland can be
found in Richard's letters. Also, relative le
ters written at Hampden-Sidney College give a
view of student life there.

Between the time the brothers graduated and

 

the outbreak of the Civil War, the correspondence
is mostly personal with a few comments on state
and national politics. Soon after the war began
Richard became an assistant surgeon in the Con-

federate Army and James became Captain Of Co. E

alst Regt.,Va. Volunteers. The letters from thx
period reflect some of the first reactions to
the outbreak of war; opinions on the Rebel vict-
ory at Bull Run; the morals of Major General
Magruder; Nelson Hospital at Yorktown; medical
efforts of the Confederacy; action around Prince
ton, Va. (1862); battle of Fredericksburg; Con-
federate deserters; Federals! treatment of civ-
ilians; life on the home front; general morale
of the army (1864); and reaction to defeat.
After the war, the letters become descriptiom
of such ordinary things as making a living, mar-
riage, and the 6 children.

William Thomas Leavell (1812-1899), for
sixty-one years an Episcopal minister in
Virginia and West Virginia, left a set of
papers which throws considerable light on
the activities of the Episcopal Church be-
tween 1838 and 1899 in that region. There

are numerous letters from Bishops John Johns

William Thos. Leavell corresponded with
the leading Episcopalians of his day in the
Virginias. Religious controversies on High
Episcopal versus Low Episcopal church,
infant baptism (Baptists versus Episcopaliang
and procedure of the baptismal ceremony and

its place in Episcopal ideology are discussed
in the letters. The discussions reached

C.S.A. There are many letters from members
of the Laurel Brigade, written many years
after the war, that recall skirmishes and
battle in detail. Major McDonald and his
brother William, a private in the same bri-
gade, were active in Confederate Associations

after the war,

Major E. A. H. McDonald was a lawyer
associated with the Louisville Abstract and
Loan Co. from 1870 to 1890, and many letters

refer to the firm and to general business
conditions in Louisville, Ky.

Scarcity of money and general depression
and drought conditions in Virginia are evi-
dent in the letters from 1870-1875, climax-
ing in the Panic of 1873.

Captain William R. Johnson and Wm. Thos,
Leavell, Jr., were associated with the Cres-_
cent Coal Mines, Crescent, W. Va., and striké
are vaguely referred to but there is little

McDonald worked for the South Penn O41 Co.
in Clarkesburg, W. Va., and there aré a
few letters in reference to the drilling of
oil wells.

William Lechmere was an attorney in London.
He is listed among London attorneys in Pigot and

and Topography of the Counties of Bedford, Cam-
bridge, Essex ... To Which is Added a Classified
Directory of London & Its Suburbs ... (London &

young man of some culture and perception.
Lechmere's Commonplace Book, 1832-1835 (67

pp.), records events, persons, and places that

 
Lechmere, William 2

 

he considered particularly interesting. The
entries are not frequent or daily as in a diary
but scattered chronologically through each year.
Each entry is a separate entity, and Lechmere
underlined the subject of each one. These items
of interest included literature (novels, poetry,
travel), a fair, zoos, plays, criminal trials,
music concerts, opera, a Spa, a flower show, a
wedding, exhibitions and fetes, and friends and
families. Lechmere usually made descriptive and
evaluative comments. Most of the entries

 
Lechmere, William 3

 

concern London, but there are a few entries for
nearby places in Surrey.
Subjects of the entries include:

1832: a fair at the Surrey Zoological Gardens
at which a Russian Horn Band played (pp. 2-4);
Tour of a German Prince in England, Ireland, etc
and how English novelists inaccurately depict the

Andrew Leckie was a merchant at Port Royal,
Virginia. On June 22, 1770, a meeting of mer-
chants was held at Williamsburg at which time
a committee was appointed to consider the gen-
eral state of trade in the colony of Virginia.

Leckie and two other merchants from Port Royal
were named to this committee. This information
appears in The Virginia Historical Register,
and Literary Note Book, Vol. III, pp. 79-81

 

 

 
Leckie, Andrew 2
(1850). Port Royal was a village on the south
bank of the Rappahannock River 22 miles below
Fredericksburg. Port Royal was still active as
a shipping place in 1855.

The Account Book, 1774-1775, contains the
name of Port Royal, Virginia, on its covers,
but Leckie's name does not appear. However,

 

the first five pages of accounts are receipts
signed by various persons, and the receipts are
made out to Andrew Leckie. Later in the volume
he apparently initialed an entry of Feb. 24,

 
Leckie, Andrew 3
1774. These facts indicate that the account
book belonged to Leckie.

The Account Book, 1774-1775, contains en-
tries for a variety of transactions. There is
a list (50 pp.) of persons who owed money to
Leckie. Their names are arranged under letters
of the alphabet, A-N, the pages for letters af-
ter N having been removed from the volume.

Many prominent Virginia family names appear in
this list. Debtor John Backhouse is presumably
the Liverpool merchant whose descendant's pa-

 

 
Leckie, Andrew 4
pers are in the Manuscript Department. A cash
account (2 pp.) dates during Jan.-Feb. 1774,
and again the subsequent pages have been lost,
their edges indicating that there were further
entries. Successive entries (37 pp.) fora
variety of transactions date from January, 1774
to July, 1775. An incomplete note of March,
1775, refers to the critical nature of the
times, the need to avoid entrapment by spys,
etc. There are a number of entries for the
tobacco trade. Most accounts in the volume are

 

 
Leckie, Andrew

 

from 1774.

Bound within the Account Book, 1774-1775, is
The Virginia Almanack for the Year of our Lord
God 1774 . . . , a volume published at Williams
burg by Purdie and Dixon. The Almanack contains
a list of officials including the governor,
council, burgesses, governors and visitors of
the college, and parishes and their ministers.

LECKIE: Apparently Leckie was a civil en-
gineer who came from Scotland to the United
States where he engaged in the construction of
public buildings, canals. arsenals, aqueducts,

and fortifications. He had at least three sons
and two daughters. The sons were James Taylor,
a graduate of South Carolc?, College and the
Medical Coblege of Philadelphia, who died at
the age of 22, Heken who married a Jones of

country. @uite Likely it 18 a Copy or the
actual report which was sent to the President.
There is no date nor any names whereby the ap-
proximate dates of this commission's work may
be determined. Evidently it was early in the
history of the Republic. The report is an ex-

 

tensive work, going into the general conditio
of the country, topography, waterways, and

possible fortifications for maintenance of the
country's independence, From the general con-

ditions the commisioners deduce the specific
means necessary for fortifying the country: a
navy, army, militia, and the fortification of
selected positions. In a thorough manner the
report then proceeds to give the population of
various states and the rapidity with which

 

militia might be assembled at fortified places
the number of miles to be marched and the
length of time for the mrching. In the same

manner all the items of expense for construct-
ing various forts on the coast are estimated,
Certainly Robert Leckie must have been a mem-
ber of this first commission for preparing

for the defense of the United States.

Leckie's papers consist largely of bus-
iness communications regarding experiments in
obtaining lime, cement stone and bricks; there:
were many reouests for financial aid and jobs

besides requests that unpaid bills be settled;
much of his earlier correspondence relates to a
dispute with James Couty also a Scotchman and
engineer for the State of South Carolina. The
G@ispute ended in a suit which Leckie won. Many
of his papers are bills for such articles as

 

nails, hinges, windows, and iron, revealing
current prices for many such articles relating
to his business.

as to throw very little light on the military
architecture of his day. Apparently the chief
value lies in the revelation of the current pric
es of commodities used in construction work.

The only papers that might be of importance in

revealing the practices of engineers of the time
are a series of 9 letters written in the 1820's
by Col. Isaac Roberdeau who established the

topographical bureau. in Washington, D.C.

were transacted on the credit basis. Hendnick
owned about 3000 acres in Mecklenburg (o.,Va..

85 in 1857 and the chief products of his Plan-

ert Hendrick died in 1862 evidently from wounds
received in the war.

The papers in this set are valuable in re-:

gard to the conduct of a series of small tobaccé
and corn farms.

The Leckie and Hendrick papers overlap and
are filed together which would make onecof the

sets slightly cumbersome to use.

valuable additions to the information on
Leckie's work as Inspectar of Masonry for the
first Division of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal,
and experiments in which he was a partner on
the development of a cement which would harden
under water, The large bulk of business corres-

The papers of Dr. Lee are letters written
by Charles _, a Confederate soldier in the
17th Georgia Regiment, Benning's Brigade,
Hood*s Division, Longstreet's I Corps, Army of
Northern Virginia. They are written by an in-

telligent, well educated soldier, and seem to
be sent to a teacher or physician under whom
this young man may have studied. Their content
is not medical.

The letter of March 18, 1863, from DiviSion

 
Lee, Dr. e 2

 

 

Headquarters near Richmond, Va., is an excel-
lent description of eamp life, mentioning a
review which President Davis did not make, the
scarcity and value of firewood, and the food
in the camp. Charles gives a good description
ef the explosion of a Confederate magazine or

laboratory which killed and injured many young
women empleyees. He relates the arrival of the
first conscripts and the return of wounded to
the 17th Georgia. Most vivid are his accounts

ef what has happened to Richmond, once the

“pride and boast of Virginia,” with its hordes
ef strangers, soldiers, knaves, fools, and
spies. Jews have gone into: "voluntary exile" '
Foreigners and many others have left, fearing
conscription. Money values, prices, and profits
are noted. The regiment, ready to move out, is

addressed by General Hood.

On June 31, 1863, Charles again writes to
Dr. Lee, this time from Snigger'’s [Snicker's]
Ferry on the Shenandoah River near Harper's

Ferry, from which he notes the many trOop move-

 
Lee, Dr. 4

 

ments of parts of Lee’s Army of Northern Vir-
ginia on the way to Gettysburg. Ewell's Cerps
has preceded Longstreet's on the way to
Pennsylvania. Charles tells of the intensely
hot weather which has caused deaths and illness
among the troops, particularly the 2nd and 7th
Georgia and the Texans of Hood's Division.

He has learned of the fight at Winchester be-
tween the troops of Generals Milroy and Ewell.
General Longstreet passes the regiment at Hazel

Run. The letter ends with news that Ewell'’s

 
Lee, Dr. 5

 

 

Cerps is already in Pennsylvania.

The third letter, June 21, 1864, is written
from the breastworks at Petersburg. The move-
ments of Longstreet and A. P. Hill are narrated
as their troops counter the march of Grant's
Army when it crosses to the south side of the

James River. General Beauregard is described
as holding the line of Bermuda Hundred and
Petersburg. Pickett's and Field's Divisions
are sent to his aid. Charles mentions Negro

cavalry. [Hink*s Colored Division, XVII Corps]

 
Lee, Dr. 6

 

 

 

The 17th Georgia is under Gen. Charles William
Field, as General Hood is wounded. Sharp fight
ing is noted in the first Union assaults on
Petersburg, June 15-18, 1864, and many casual-
ties result.

Goldsborough. Copies of personal and family
letters and a few originals dating in the 1890!
and 1900's come from another great-granddaughte
Alexandra (Lee) Levin.

Edmund Jennings Lee II (1797-1877) was the
oldest son of Edmund J. Lee I of Alexandria and
a first cousin of General Robert Edward Lee. He
was educated at Princeton University and studied
law in his father's office in Alexandria. Afte
a short term of legal practice in Wheeling, W.
Va., and his marriage to Eliza Shepherd on Oct.

 

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 5 :
7, 1823, he came to Shepherdstown, the home of
his wife's family. Here he built "Leeland" on
a hill overlooking the town. The children of
his first marriage, Ellen (Lee) Powell and
Charles Shepherd Lee, became involved in the
legal battle over the Rezin Davis Shepherd
estate in 1866.

 

Mr. Lee married a second time on Sept. 7,
1835. His wife, Henrietta Bedinger of "Bedford,"
was related to the Rutherfords, Morgans, Lucases
Rusts, Washingtons, and Dandridges, whose
affairs are reflected in the manuscripts.

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 6
The Lee family all were interested in the
practice of law, many professional letters
coming from the brothers of Edmund J. Lee,
Charles Henry Lee, Richard Henry Lee, and
Cassius Francis Lee. Edmund Jennings Lee II
corresponded with lawyers over the length of
the Potomac River Valley from Washington and

 

Baltimore to Cumberland, Md. Many citizens of
Maryland and Virginia appear in his papers.
Chancery cases, damage suits, collections,
administrations of estates, guardianships, and
all other types of practice are involved.

 
Lee, Bdmund Jennings, II 7
Johns Hopkins Brothers and Company of Baltimore,
the Mutual Assurance Society of Richmond, the
Virginia and Maryland Bridge Company, and
Trinity Episcopal Church of Shepherdstown. are
concerns of Mr. Lee,

The correspondence, bills and receipts,
legal papers, and ledgers intermesh to form an
excellent source for the local history of the
Potomac Valley. Before 1830 the meager corres-
pondence contains a few references to the
affairs of Trinity Church, but after that year
the volume of letters increases as Lee's legal

 

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 8
practice in Shepherdstown grows. Dy 1832 he is
involved in claims on the Fairfax estate with
such lawyers as John Rogers Cooke, Joseph Lane,
and Cassius Francis Lee.

Among the many prominent names appearing in
the papers are those of the Striders, Shepherds,
Botelers, Hodgson, the Dandridge-Pendleton-

 

Stephen group, the Hamtramcks, Sniders,
Pendletons of Lexington, Va., John Yates Beall,
the Lucases, Robert Young and David Holmes
Conrad, John Rutherford, Andrew Hunter, Edmund
Pendleton, David Weisel, Charles Mynn Vonrad,

 
Lee, Bdmund Jennings, II 9
Francis Yetes, Charles James Faulkner I and II,
Maria Peters and the Bedingers, Robert
Rutherford, the Washingtons of "Harewood,"
Jubal Early, Edmund Jennings, et al.

The letters include one written on Mar. 1l,
1858, by Rezin Davis Shepherd, setting up a
charitable fund for Shepherdstown which he

 

placed at the disposal of the mayor and city
council.

The American Colonization Society had been
active in Shepherdstown. In 1858 letters from
Snider slaves freed and sent to Liberia are

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 10
received. In the letters are requests for
supplies.

The Civil War period is represented by copies
of letters of Edwin Gray Lee, the eldest son of
Edmund Jennings and Henrietta (Bedinger) Lee.
Edwin Gray Lee married Susan Pendleton of Lexig
ton, Va. in 1859, so that many of his letters
are found in the papers of his father-in-law,
C.S.A. General William Nelson Pendleton. Xerox
copies of these are with the Lee Papers, as wel
as Xerox copies of correspondence of Susan
(Pendleton) Lee and other members of her family

 

 
Lee, Kdmund Jennings, II 11
in Lexington, Va.

The illness which eventually proved fatal to
Edwin Gray Lee became acute during his field
service with the Confederate Army, forcing his
retirement from active duty. By 1863 he was
involved with John Yates Beall of the Confed-
erate Secret Service, who was operating against

 

U.S. ships in the Chesapeake Bay from a base in
Mathews County, Va. The extent of Edwin Gray
Lee's career as a Confederate agent is not
easily ascertained. By the end of 1864 he was
on the way to Canada West, where he was

 
Lee, Hdmund Jennings, II 12
associated with Beverley Tucker and Jacob
Thompson,

(Mrs. Levin had Xerox copies made of
Pendleton-Lee correspondence from the Wm. Nelsa
Pendleton Papers, Southern Historical Collec-
tion, at the University of North Carolina.
Copies on yellow legal paper are from private
sources, )

Cassius Francis Lee, brother of E.J. Lee II,
was also in Canada in the Confederate Secret
service.

Young Edwin Gray Lee and his wife continued

 

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 13

to stay in Canada in 1865 while the Lees in
Jefferson County lived at the Episcopal rectory
in Shepherdstown. In 1857 "Leeland" had

burned and Edmund Jennings Lee moved to Bedford;
the family home of his wife which he purchased
from Hienry Bedinger III. This house was

burned by Union General David Hunter in 1864,
so that the Lee family were in temporary
quarters. At seventy years of age Edmund J.
Lee II rebuilt "Leeland," only the small brick
office of which had been left standing. His
county, Jefferson, was now in the new state of

 

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings II 14
West Virginia.

Edwin Gray Lee wrote an article, "The Policy
of France and England in North America," dated
May 16, 1865, which he intended to publish in
Europe in pamphlet form. The fall of the
Confederacy prevented this.

 

The Pendleton letters from Lexington, Va. to
the young Lees in Chambly, Ontario, are
excellent for conditions in Va. in 1865, while
the Lee letters from Canada comment on
Lincoln's assassination and the life of the
Confederate refugees in Canada.

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings II +5
Many citizens of Jefferson County were not
eager to remain in West Virginia, nor in favor
of Virginia's division into two states. Robert
Young Conrad and Charles James Faulkner write
on reconstruction, The court system and its
judges were of great concern to these lawyers.
Edmund Jennings Lee resumed his duties as

 

agent for the Mutual Assurance Company of
Richmond. He corresponded for many years with
John Rutherford and H.A. Claiborne of this
company. As late as Jan., 1866, he was not
able to practice before the courts in Jefferson

County. A loyalty oath was required before a
pardon was issued and citizenship resumed. On
Feb. 1, 1866, Andrew Hunter wrote of an appeal
to the U.S. Supreme Court to restore Jefferson
and Berkeley counties to Va.

A descendant of the founder of Shepherdstown
and a very rich New Orleans businessman, Rezin
Davis Shepherd of Wild Goose Farm, Jefferson
Co., died in Nov., 1865. Early in 1866 the
legal battle over his estate began. Rezin Davis
Shepherd had one daughter, Mrs. Ellen (Shepherd

 

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings II 17
Brooks, and many nieces and nephews. He had
controlled the estate of his brother James

(d. 1837), whose will left his property to his
nieces and nephews on the death of Rezin
Shepherd, The two children of Edmund Jennings
Lee II by his first wife were among the heirs
who sued for a part of this inheritance.

 

Charles Mynn Conrad and his sons, New Orleans
lawyers, represented the plaintiffs. Corres-
pondence and legal papers reflect this case,
Daniel Bedinger Lucas is among those who
corresponds about the suit.

Meanwhile, as president of the Virginia and
Maryland Bridge Company, Edmund J. Lee II began
a movement to rebuild the bridge over the
Potomac which was destroyed at the beginning of
the Civil War.

David Holmes Conrad of Winchester, on Apr.
3, 1868, gave a brief glimpse of the despair of
Virginians at the "systematized oppression" of
radical politicians.

Another Va. estate, that of Robert Rutherfo
became involved in the courts in 1869 in

Kentucky.

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings II 19
Family members writing are Rear Admiral
Samuel Phillips Lee in 1866 and Charles Carter

Lee of Powhatan County in 1870.

A letter from William Nelson Pendleton on
Mar. 15, 1870, shows the political maneuvering
for local office among Virginians. Edwin Gray
Lee, seriously ill with tuberculosis, was in
Mobile, Ala. General Pendleton writes of a
visit to Robert Edward Lee, who has been ill
but seems to be recovering.

On Feb. 13 and 14, 1871, Edmund J. Lee stated
he was willing to compromise the Shepherd suit.

 

 
Lee, Kdmund Jennings, II 20
At this time another litigation was beginning
in the eminent Jefferson County family of the
Washingtons of “Harewood" Both correspondence
and legal papers in this case are complicated
by the interrelationships of the Washingtons
and the Clemsons. Evidently a copperplate
bearing the arms of the Washington family (made

 

in France ca. 1770 for bookplates for George
Washington), was found in the cellar at
"Harewood" about 1840. The relic passed into
the possession of Ann Bull (Clemson) Washington
widow of George Lafayette Washington, who was

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II cL
living in 1871 at Siegfried's Bridge, North-
ampton County, Pa.

Before his death George Lafayette Washington
had sold "Harewood," and payments on the pur-
chase price were held up by injunction as the
suit over the possession of the copper plate
was instigated by the family of the sister of

 

George Lafayette Washington. (See chart with
legal papers, Washington folder.)

Litigation continued during the 1870's.
Eventually the copperplate was sold to the
Boston Public Library. Members of the Washing-

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II ae
ton and Clemson families write to Edmund J.
Lee, who presumably was attorney for Ann Bull
(Clemson) Washington.

On May 29, 1872, H.H. Blackburn, partner of
Ward Hill Lamon, described a land swindle
originating in Philadelphia in regard to a
mythical survey of 32,000 acres in W. Va.

 

supposedly belonging to Robert Morris.

3y 1872 a somewhat normal law practice had
been resumed with estate administrations and
collections, A suit arose in regard to the Va.
and Maryland Bridge Company. The new W. Va.

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II a
laws of incorporation differed from the Virginia
ones. Questions arose as to the authority of
the incorporators in running the bridge.

Jubal Anderson Early replied to a letter
from Edmund Jennings Lee on Sept. 26, 1872.
"Bedford," the Lee home, had been burned on
July 26, 1864, by Union General David Hunter.
Evidently there were rumors that Early had
ordered the burning of Montgomery Blair's house
on his Washington raid on July 12, 1864, so that
Hunter was retaliating when he burned "Bedford.
The reply of Early is a good commentary on his

 

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 24
conduct during his raid. He states he did not
order Blair's house burned and tells why he did
not. He does say, however, that he regretted
that lack of time prevented his burning more
property than he did.

The question of a portrait of Frances

 

Lightfoot Lee for Independence Hall in
Philadelphia was discussed on March 5, 1873, by
Cassius Francis Lee.

Associated with their father in law practice
were Charles Shepherd Lee, who evidently went
to Berryville, Va.; and Edmund Jennings Lee III

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 25
who remained in Shepherdstown. Edmund Jennings
Lee II died on Aug. 10, 1877; his wife,
Henrietta (Bedinger) Lee, lived until Oct. 7,
1898. Edmund Jennings Lee III, with his wife
Rebecca (Rust) Lee, lived at "Leeland" with
their sons, Lawrence, Edmund, and Armestead

 

until E. J. Lee III died in 1896.

The bills and receipts concern personal
expenses, legal work, the rebuilding of “Lee-
land" in 1868, and the names of many local
mercantile firms and Baltimore businesses.

Bight volumes with this addition center on
the Lee family law practice and business ven-
tures from 1799 until 1876. The earliest
volume, 1799-ca. 1830, belongs to Edmund J. Lee
I of Alexandria, who made notes from different

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings II 29
English law writers to use in his practice,
Edmund Jennings Lee II continued this volume.
The various ledgers contain the business back-
ground of the Lee law practice. They are both
with the collection and in the bound volume
file.

 

A volume dated 1818-1848 begins as a record
of the Shepherdstown and Winchester Turnpike
Company. A private company of subscribers was
incorporated by the Virginia Legislature in
1816 and began functioning in 1818. James L.
Lane was elected president. by the stockholders,

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 30
together with a board of directors. Specifi-
cations for the building of the road are given
(p. 6). Abraham Shepherd soon became president
and Thomas Tool treasurer. Grade notes as
surveyed and graded were recorded (p. 14). In
1819 $2000 was paid to William Short for

 

services, The turnpike had to secure by pur-
chase the right-of-way through property of
various land owners. In 1821 the record book
becomes a ledger with wages as well as collec-
tions of tolls of gatekeepers recorded. Various

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II ai
Jefferson County residents had accounts with
the company for use of the toll turnpike.

In 1824 the accounts of the Shepherdstown
and Smithfield Turnpike Company begin (p. 58).
The company conducted its business through
Daniel Buckleo, treasurer, who served from ca,

 

1824 till ca. 1848. Evidently the main source
of income was from tolls. At the back of the
book annual lists were kept of persons "passing
by the year." Each paid a fee.

A notebook of a nephew of Mrs. Lee, George

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 32
Rust Bedinger, a student at the University of
Virginia in 1859 gives brief notes on logic.
After a gap where a number of pages are cut out
the notebook becomes a lettercopy book in the
1870's and finally an account book. The
financial effairs of Edmund Jennings Lee II at

 

his death in 1877 are discussed (p. 37-39).

Mr. Lee had assumed large security debts for
his brother Charles and others. Rear Admiral
Samuel Phillips Lee had made a loan to enable
Mr.. Lee to rebuild "Leeland." This debt was

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 43

 

dischargea through the gift of this bond by
S.P. Lee to Mrs. Henrietta Lee after the death
of her husband,

The Lee MSS. are supplemented by the Danske
Dandridge Papers. Also the papers of the
Reverend Charles Wesley Andrews, her minister

and friend, gives additional information about
the Lees and Shepherdstown. The George Rust
Papers of Londown County, Va., also relate to
this family. All these collections are in

this department.

the family history of the Lees and their rela-
tives by marriage, the Bedingers of Shepherds-
town, Virginia. A number of letters by the
Washington family as well as references to its
members are contained in the papers. Business
affairs of the Lee brothers, Cassius Francis,
Charles Henry, and Richard Henry intermesh with

those of Edmund J. Lee, II. Their correspon-
dence before the Civil War reveals their con-
fused dismay at secession, and, after the fall
of the Confederacy, shows the desperate finan-
cial situation in Virginia. Edmund J. Lee was

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 36

 

the faithful administrator of many family
trusts during a long lifetime.

Legal papers center mainly in Bedinger fami-
ly affairs, Mrs. Henrietta (Bedinger) Lee
being a member of this group.

The financial papers contain miscellaneous
receipts for expenses of slave arrests, runa-
ways, hiring of slaves, and taxes.

through the blockade with his wife Sue and
Edward McGuire, C.S.N., he traveled 1081 miles
from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Toronto. This
diary of a secret service mission gives no
actual details of what Edwin Gray Lee did for
the Confederacy. He met Clement Claiborne
Clay, confederate Commissioner, as the latter
was leaving Canada. After he arrived in Toron-
to on January 25, 1865, he notes the movements
of many Confederates, among whom were Edward
McGuire, Beverley Tucker, Daniel Bedinger
Lucas, Charley[Armstrong], Jacob Thompson, and

+

 
Lee, Edmund Jennings, II 38
Tom Davis. Canada was a refuge for many Con-
federate families in 1865, most of whom Lee
visited. He mentioned sending letters by
courier to Judah P. Benjamin. Evidently Edwin
Gray Lee had at his disposal gold which he used
to aid General George Edward Pickett and wWil-
liam Jefferson Buchanan in Canada. He also

 

sent money to General William Nelson Pendleton
in Virginia to aid "sufferers." The despair of
the Confederate colony at the defeat of their

cause and the ill health of Lee dominate the

last pages.

John Fitzgerald Lee (1813-1884) was the
second son of Francis Lightfoot and Jane
(Fitzgerald) Lee. He studied at West Point and
attained the position of Judge Advocate of the
U.S. Army. He was appointed to this post in
1849 and held it until 1862. His sympathies
for the South forced him to resign and retire
to the "Lodge," an estate in Prince George's
Co,, Md. which had been in his wife's family
since it was first granted to them by Lord

Baltimore, ao

 
Lee, John Fitzgerald 2

He had made Washington, D.C., his home
during his military service and resumed
spending the winters there in 1873. About a
year before his death, he and his wife and
daughter Anne removed to St. Louis where his
sons Arthur and John Fitzgerald, Jr. had formed
a law partnership. He died in that city.

Lucy B. Lee was the mother of two Union
soldiers during the Civil War. Edwin D. Lee
(b. 1834) enlisted in the 27th Massachusetts
Volunteers in 1862, later becoming First Lieu-
tenant and Adjutant. He saw service in North

Carolina in 1862-1863 and died of disease at
Julian's Creek, Virginia, on July 17, 1864.
Charles F, Lee, Jr. (b. 1842) served in the 18th

Massachusetts Volunteers in 1861-1862, being
wounded severely at Second Manassas in August,

 
Lee, Lucy B. y 4
1862. After receiving a medical discharge, he
served as a recruiting officer in Massachusetts.
He enlisted later in the 57th and 55th Massachu-
setts Volunteers, but his wound forced his res-
ignation from the former, At the end of the war

he was a member of the latter regiment. He died
in 1876.

 

This collection consists of letters written
from these two soldiers to their mother and an
exchange of letters between Mrs. Lee and Charles
B. Fox, secretary of the 55th Regiment Associa-
tion upon the death of Charles F. Lee in 1876.

 
Lee, Lucy B. 3
One letter, of May 18, 1862, was written by
Charles F, Lee describing conditions in Virginia,
He mentions the Peninsula Campaign siege at
Yorktown, a mansion owned by one of Robert E.
Lee's sons, Negroes in the area, and his opinion
of General McClellan. Three letters are from
Edwin D, Lee. Two, of June 6, 1862, and May 27,

 

1863, were written from New Bern, North Carolina.
The first describes the torrid weather and ill-
ness prevalent in the area. Also mentioned are
his opinions on the postal service and General
Burnside. The second tells of a

 
Lee, Lucy B.

skirmish at Gum Swamp on May 22, 1863, the
commissioning of Brigadier General Francis B
Spinola, and the formation of a Negro

brigade. His third letter, of October 29, 1863,
was written from Boston, and describes the
trials and tribulations of a recruiting officer,
which he expected his brother to face in the

 

latter's new position. Two letters of 1876

note the death of Charles F, Lee. The first, of
November 17, is from Charles B. Fox, expressing
sorrow over Lee's death and asking for a short
recounting of his military career to place in

 
Lee, Lucy B.

the 55th Regiment Association record. Mrs.
Lee's answer, of December 12, recounts the
military career of Charles F, Lee from enlist-
ment in 1861 to his death and also mentions that
Edwin died in 1864.

The letters in this collection were written
by R. H. Lee, a Confederate soldier, to his wife
in Greensboro, Alabama. Lee revealed his pessi-
mism and expressed his fears that the Union Army
would take over the South and make of them a
subjugated people. It is also of concern to him

that men are called to military service, thereby
being forced to abandon their farms. There is
brief discussion of General Isham Warren Garrott
and Major Felix Tait, but Lee's unit evidently
did not see action during this time.

LEE, Robert Edward. Letters. 1749-1939. Arling-
ton & Lexington, Va. Sketch. EXXRELERRE

These letters relate chiefly to General Rob-
ert E. Lee (1807-1870),and secondarily to other
members of the Lee family. The letters deal
with many phases of Lee's life, from the time of
his marriage in 1832 until his death. Family

and personal affairs were much discussed, espec-

lally in Lee's letters to his cousin, Mrs. Anna

M. ha berg om The settlement of the Custis es-
mpro

tate and vements at Arlington occupied
his attention between 1858 and 1860,

During the War the correspondence falls into two
Classes; official and that addressed to members
of his family. Both furnish valuable informa-
tion on many points, and there are many details
of military activity. The post-war letters re-
veal details of domestic arrangements following

 

the family's removal to Lexington.

Aside from the mere augffograph value of letter
coming from a prominent Va. family and a great
man, the collection has intrinsic value in the

information which it contai
the War and to the Lee ta both to

These dispatches were bound into a volume
by Charles Coleock Jones, Jr., the bibliophile.
They are almost wholly telegrams sent by Lee
from the field to Jefferson Davis, or to the

Lee's handwriting, but most were written by
aides or telegraph operators. 4 considerable

number were endorsed by James Alexander Seddon,

This untitled manuscript (439 pp.) by the
English naturalist Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich Lee
(1791-1856) narrates the history of African
exploration and attempts "to give a faithful
description of the present state of Africa"
as Europeans knew it in 1825. Her manuscript
reflects an enlarged Eurdpean curiosity
about Africa: '" The continent of Africa has
of late years excited a considerable interest,
a feeling which has gained strength from the
desire of ameliorating the conditions of its

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 2

 

inhabitants and from the obstacles opposed to
all who have been led towards it by the hope
of discovery."

Mrs. Lee knew these hopes and obstacles
firsthand, She shared an interest in science
and discovery with her first husband, the
English explorer and naturalist Thomas Edward

Bowdich (1791-1824). Bowdich's interests in
botany, natural history and geography led him
and his talented wife into that circle of

famous naturalists who gathered around Baron

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich

 

de Cuvier. Bowdich and his wife knew Cuvier,
Biot and Alexander von Humboldt who opened
their libraries and collections to the English
couple following Bowdich's account of his
first travels in Africa. Published in 1819

as A Mission from Cape Coast Colony to
Ashantee, their description of the Ashantees
made Bowdich immediately famous. He and his
wife returned to Africa, where Bowdich died
of a fever on the Gambia River in 1824 shortly
after their arrival. His wife completed his
description of Madeira and appended her own

 

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 4
narrative of Bowdich's death with a description
of Gambia (Excursions in Madeira and Porto
Santo appeared in 1825). Returning to England,
she remarried and worked as a writer and illus-
trator,

Mrs. Lee's manuscript is an untitled work
on Africa that is a survey of European know-
ledge of the mysterious continent, It does
not appear that Mrs. Lee saw many of the
nations she describes. Instead, her method
consisted in "selecting details from the
narratives of those whose names alone inspire

 

 

 

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 5
confidence,”

The authenticity of the manuscript was ver-
ified sometime in the last fifteen years by
T. A. J. Burnett, one of the assistant
keepers at the British Museum. He stated that
the handwriting appeared to match the writing
in one of her letters. He was unable to

 

connect the manuscript with any of Mrs. Lee's
published works. His note is filed with the
manuscript.

The box enclosing the manuscript is stamped
with the date 1825. The paper has dated

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 6
watermarks. The paper of the earlier segments
of the manuscript is dated 1814, and later ones
were written on paper marked 1828.

Mrs. Lee's manuscript begins with a descrip-
tion of Egypt. The few remainders of classical
antiquity disappointed her. According to Mrs.
Lee the houses of the Arab city of Alexandria,

 

built with inner courtyards and no windows,
"resemble prisons in their outward appearance."
She found the newer city of Cairo to be the more
interesting. Mrs. Lee reports that Mohammed
Ali Pasha, the Turkish viceroy, was attempting

 
Lee, Sarah ( Wallis) Bowdich
to improve the manners of his countrymen.
had just established a college where mathematics,
drawing, surveying, French and Italian were
taught .

Of the celebrated Memphis there is scarcely
a vestige, '" she lamented, but consoled herself

 

with the thought that "the most sublime ruins

in the world" could be found at Thebes. Mrs.
Lee had heard of the work of Giovanni Belzoni,
who until his death in 1823, had been excavating
the Egyptian tombs and revealing their treasure
of mummies, sarcophagi and paintings. Egypt

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 8
in the 1820°s presented a marked contrast to
the image of the ancient land called to mind
by the tombs. Mrs. Lee described the Egyptians
as being "enslaved to the most barbarous
superstition" and religious fanaticism. She
had an explanation for this decline: "It is

 

the Mahometan religion which has rendered this

once fair country preeminent in desolation."
Slavery was a flourishing institution in

Egypt and the Sudan, At the port of Souakin

in the Sudan could be found the "greatest empor-

ium for slaves in North Eastern Africa." Mrs.

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich

Lee offers descriptions of the interior too,
following the Nile past the principal cities

of “Nubia” and the Sudan. She was told that
5,000 slaves were sold each year at Shendi.

Mrs. Lee gives a detailed account of the various
peoples--Arabs, Turks, Negroes, etc.--who com-
posed the local. population.

 

In North Africa "we find every horror of
tyranny and cruelty verified." Mrs. Lee
apparently disliked the Barbary States and
passed over them with only brief descriptions

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 10
of Tripoli, Bizerta, Tunis, Algiers, Fez and
the ports of Morocco. Much of her material
seems to have come from Dr. Thomas Shaw's
Travels in Barbary.

 

 

Senegal:
At Senegal Mrs. Lee found the French to

be re-establishing their colony and intensifying
their plantations. Large plots of land were
laid out for rice and indigo crops. The French,
true to themselves, were also making plans to

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 11
grow the vine. The Senegalese colony was the
most populous colony north of the Equator.
Labor for the French plantations proved
to be a problem, "for the natives cannot be
induced to perform the necessary labor and
the expense of European workmen would of
itself be a sufficient barrier to their
employment did not the climate render such a
plan impracticable."
One of the principal sources of income at
Senegal was the gum trade. An inland people

 

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 12

 

brought their gum to Senegal ports where the
French established a monopoly ("The French who
hold possession of this place are extremely
tenacious of intercourse with other nations
and suffer none but their countrymen to land
for barter with the Arabs [blacks]," p. 299).
Senegal's lush vegetation fascinated Mrs.
Lee, who was an accomplished naturalist in her
own right. Baobab, or the Monkey bread trees,
grew to great proportions. Mrs. Lee found one
with a root 110 feet long and 80 feet in
circumference. The Senegal River she found

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 13
full of crocodiles and hippopotami. She repor-
ted elephants, ostriches, and "an abundance of
locusts, cockroaches and other tropical

nuisances."
The Joloffs (Wolofs) were a "tall, well-made,

handsome and courageous race of people." The
women were "quite remarkable for their beauty,"

 

wore short shifts or two over lapping drapes,

with a number of kerchiefs worn "so as to form
a high cone" (p. 303). The men wore short

breeches, a vest and small turbans. The
Joloffs, it seems, had only partially converted

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 14

 

to Islam and only those women who were Moslems
ate separately. "The greater number however
are pagans, or perhaps have but little idea of
religion." Polygamy was practiced, and their
principal occupation was farming.

Gambia:

Mrs. Lee found the British settlement of
Bathurst at the mouth of the Gambia River to
be “at present the most prosperous of our
colonies" (p. 306). The city of Bathurst

St. Mary's had been founded in 1816. Placed

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 15
on the island of Banjole, the colony at Bathurst
was ideally located for relaying African prod-
ucts from the interior or serving as a waysta-
tion for Atlantic shipping. The abolition of
the slave trade in 1808 gave the British another
incentive for patrolling the Gambia River.
According to Mrs. Lee's estimate, Bathurst in

 

1825 "possesses at least 2,000 residents."
However, in her description of Gambia published
in 1825 as a supplement to her husband's
Excursions in Madeira and Porto Santo a census
taken in 1823 put the population at 200 souls,

 

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 16
independent of servants, strangers’ and the
garrison of 100 soldiers (p. 204). The higher
figure in the manuscript would seem to be cor-
rect.

In both accounts Mrs. Lee reckoned the
Gambia to be unhealthy ("I pronounce Bathurst
to be the least healthy of all our settle-

 

ments...,'' Excursions, p. 202). Pools of
stagnant water, “putrid vegetable matter" and
mangroves were only partially alleviated by
drainage and tree clearing. Hot winds from the
interior brought fever to the colony every

 

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 17
year, aided by the wide variation in daily
temperatures. Not surprisingly then, Thomas
Bowdich succumbed to a fever caught there in
1824.

Still, Mrs. Lee found Bathurst to be pleasant
enough. “The houses of the merchants are built
of stone, have slate colored roofs and green
verandas and look remarkably pretty from the
river. The broad expanse of water, the deep
masses of forest beyond, the cheerful air of
the settlement, with its Government House,
handsome hospital, and barracks with the Englis

 

 
.

Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 18

flag flying in the midst from a small battery,

make its approach very prepossessing" (p. 308).
From Gambia Mrs. Lee's narrative travels to

 

Sierra Leone, "hitherto considered the most
important of our settlements in Africa"

where "cargo after cargo of the unhappy victims"
of the slave trade were being freed as part

of British attempts to break up the slave
trade. Some thirty years after the Sierra
Leone Company had begun its colony (1791) Mrs.
Lee judged the anti-slavery experiment to be a

failure.

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 19
At Dahomey Mrs. Lee found an impressive

people, “ferocious toward their enemies, but

kind to strangers."' The people of Dahomey

were skilled weavers and did metal work as well.

Food was pléntiful and well-prepared, and Mrs.

Lee reports that the soil was fertile. She

saw indigo, cotton, sugar cane, tobacco, and

 

various grains and fruits. Mrs. Lee developed
a taste for a highly-seasoned Dahomian black
soup, made of fish, vegetables and palm oil.
She was repulsed by the local delicacy of

dog meat, however.

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 20
Mrs. Lee has also left an account of the
King of Dahomey and his court at Calmina (7),
"a large town containing some thousand inhab-
itants," and the city of Abomey. Mrs. Lee's

 

admiration for the Dahomians was entirely upset
by their chief celebrations, which were marred
by human sacrifices. Mrs. Lee also repeats a

story that the death of the King of Dahomey
led his wives to kill one another.

The Englishwoman was pleased to find that
the Yoruba tribesmen respected their dogs as
pets rather than food. Similarly, they paid

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 21
more regard to human life. "All people pay
great respect to the fetish,. . . but they
do not sacrifice human victims."

Descriptions of the peoples of what are now
Nigeria, the Cameroon and Gabon follow. In
the Congo region the land turned into "a very
fertile country yielding three crops of corn

 

(wheat) in a year." At Loango the Congolese
traded ivory and slaves for cloth, copper,

lead, iron, and cheap goods. She labelled the
Congolese to be a distinct people, different
both in language and in culture from the related

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 22
peoples of West Africa ("very low in the scale
of civilization").

Mrs. Lee attempted to gather information
about Portuguese Angola. Even in 1824 the
Portuguese kept the door shut on the outer
world, for we find Mrs. Lee reporting that
"little is known of the present condition of

 

the natives, owing to the close policy of the

Portuguese government." The Portuguese main-
&

tained a large standing army composed of native
troops with Portuguese officers, according to
Mrs. Lee."This force is necessary to their

safety as ae

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 23
they have several formidable neighbors, includ-
ing one set of enemies who could put 180,000
armed men into the field. .

From Angola Mrs. Lee's account jumps to the
Cape of Good Hope. Cape Town consisted of 20
streets laid at right angles, with brick and

 

stucco houses. The English colony boasted its
Government House, a court, a fortress with
barracks, and a newspaper, the Cape Town Gaz-
ette, a theater, 2 churches and a mosque for

the Malay servants. The population was already
a mixture of different peoples: "The Hottentot

 

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 24
population is now much less numerous than the
white, and the most valuable servants are the
Malays." Although food was cheap, labor and
house rents were quite expensive.

Nearby, at Geradendal, a colony of Moravian
missionaries had established themselves,
apparently in hopes of converting the Hottentot

 

There, any of them "willing to be instructed
are taken as apprentices."

Mrs. Lee found the Hottentots to be"harmless,
quiet 'and hospitable." Curious about them, she
left a succint description of them (pp. 413-14).

 
Lee, Sarah (Wallis) Bowdich 25
Mrs. Lee’s work on Africa concludes with a
rapid tour of the principal islands or archi-
pelagos off the African coasts, many of which
she had seen. She describes Mauritius, Mada-
gascar (one she undoubtedly hadn't seen), St.

Helena, Sao Thome, Fernando Poo, the Cape
Yerde Islands, Madeira, the Canaries, and the
Azores,

Lee Family. Papers. “Needwood," near Peters-
ville, Frederick Co., Md.

 

Governor Thomas Sim Lee (1745-1819) of
"“Needwood," near Petersville, Frederick County,
aryland, was governor in 1779-1783, a member
of the Continental Congress, and again governor
of the state from 1792 to 1794. His youngest

son, Colonel John Lee, a lawyer and Federalist
politician noted for his elegance, represented
Maryland in the Congress from 1823 to 1825,
serving as Congressional escort for Gen. Lafayette

 
Lee Family

 

on his visit in 1824. Colonel Lee married
Harriet Carroll in 1832.

Eliza Lee, daughter of Governor Lee, married
Outerbridge Horsey (1777-1842), who was
Avtorney General of Delaware and served as
U. S. Senator from that state. The Horsey
family moved to "Needwood" in 1821 when Eliza

(Lee) Horsey inherited that estate.

A few early papers in this collection
pertain to the governorship of Thomas Sim
Lee. A list of persons indicted for treason by

 
Lee Family 3

 

the General Court at Annapolis in May, 1781,
includes the names of Daniel Dulaney, George
Howard, and Bennett Allen.* Governor Lee
organized the Maryland militia. On Oct. 2,
1794, a report on blankets for troops stationed
at Frederick is made to him. An instance of
the transport for sale into slavery of free
Negroes out of Maryland to Hillsborough, N. Ce,
is reported on Nov. 6, 1794.

In 1828 Colonel John Lee and Outerbridge
Horsey, his brother-in-law, formed a

*Item that was transferred to the Maryland
Diocesan Library.

 
Lee Family

 

partnership for the operation of a sugar
plantation near Thibodeauville, Lafourche
Parish, Louisiana. Each man was to contribute
slaves from his estate in Maryland and both
partners were in Louisiana at various times
from 1828 until bec. 31, 1834, when the
partnership terminated under circumstances

of financial difficulty. They differed because
Horsey did not approve of Lee's expensive plans
for development of the plantation. Horsey
spent part of each year at Thibodeauville in

 
Lee Family 5

 

residence, and Lee finished out the remainder
of each year there. A suit at law was finally
brought by Horsey against Lee, the papers of
which give details of the administration of
a Louisiana sugar plantation.

On December 5, 1833, John Lee wrote to
John Linton of New Orleans to ascertain the

value of his holdings on the Lafourche,
agreeing that absentee ownership of plantations
was not profitable. Governor Henry Johnson of
Louisiana, serving in the Congress in 1835,

 
Lee Family 6
wrote to John Lee advising him not to sell his
portion of the plantation until Johnson
returned to Louisiana in March, 1835.
Evidently the sugar market was depressed.
Horsey and Lee sold sugar and molasses
through Lambeth and Thompson of New Orleans,
who kept them informed of prices and market
conditions. The accounts in the financial
papers show large shipments to this firm.
John Lee was in Louisiana early in 1835.
On Feb. 28 he wrote to Horsey of large debts

 

 
Lee Family

Z

 

whose payment was soon
on the "diminished and
Negroes working on the
effect of overwork and

due. He then commented
exhausted" force of
plantation and on the
severe treatment on the

Negroes.- This letter proposed the immediate

sale of the plantation

or a continuation of

its operation under Lee's sole management

until Jan. 1, 1836, with an additional labor

force. Lee mentions employing white laborers

at the rolling house on the plantation.
Outerbridge Horsey and Lee were in

 
Lee Family 8
litigation by December, 1335, when Horsey wrote
to his attorney, George Schley of Frederick,
Maryland. Frederick Augustus Schley, the
father of George, appears many times in the
legal papers.

A letter dated 1851 is evidently from
Outerbridge Horsey's son Outerbridge.

The legal papers in the lawsuit form three
main sections: those of general information,
A through F, about the case; exhibits and
accounts of John Lee, the defendant, and his

 

 
Lee Family

 

attorney, William Schley; and the exhibits and
accounts of Outerbridge Horsey, the plaintiff,
and his counsel, Frederick A. Schley.

These legal papers contain articles of
partnership, lists of slaves contributed and
lost in this venture; those sold with the
estate on March 27, 1836, for payment of debts;
and the complaint of Horsey and Lee's reply
before the Court of Chancery in Frederick
County. The interrogations in the general
papers contain details of management of the

plantation.

 
Lee Family

 

Both Horsey and Lee made claims for
expenditures during their partnership which
reveal purchases of supplies and medicines,
expenses for transportation and travel, and
arrangements for supplying slave labor.

This case was complicated by a large
mortgage on the Lafourche plantation held by
Henry Johnson and John Linton's estate. On
March 28, 1836, the sheriff of Lafourche
Parish sold the plantation and slaves to settle
debts. The documents dealing with the mortgage

 
Lee Family

 

and sale are with John Lee's exhibits.
Outerbridge Horsey's papers show a funda-
mental difference between the partners on the
improvement and management of the plantation.
Colonel Lee wanted to build expensive housing;
Horsey did not.
The financial papers include accounts for

Supplies, bills and receipts for smaller,
miscellaneous expenses, etc. The death of a
Negro slave involved proceedings by a
coroner's jury before burial in March, 1835.

Legaré, Hugh Swinton, Papers, 1837-1843.
Charleston, Charleston Co., S.C.

 

Hugh Swinton Legaré was a prominent lawyer,
editor of the Southern Review, and attorney
general under Pres. Tyler.

On Dec. 17, 1837, James Hamilton, Gov. of
S. C., wrote Legaré to ask him to use his

 

influence with Leyi Woodbury to secure a post
for a friend. Hamilton also expresses his
views on Federal financial policies and on

S. C. politics. This letter was formerly

in the Seaborn Jones MSS.

 
Legare, Hugh Swinton 2

 

Joel Roberts Poinsett, then Secretary of
War, wrote Legaré on Oct. 7, 1838, to inform
him "of the details concerning ratification of
atreaty with the Sioux Indians. Poinsett
speaks of an attack on his activities by John
Bell, a leading politician from Tenn. Enclosed
in the letter is a newspaper clipping recording

the substance of a speech delivered by Legaré
in the House of Representatives. Legaré
supported Poinsett against the criticisms of
Richard Biddle of Penn, The letter and

 
Legaré, Hugh Swinton 3

 

clipping were transferred from the Joel Roberts
Poinsett Papers.

In a letter dated Dec. 4, 1838, Legaré gave
Thomas Reynolds advice on a proposed trip to
Europe and asked Reynolds to purchase some
books for him in Brussels.

On Apr. 14, 1839, Legaré wrote the Rev.
Stephen Elliott to ask that he send him some
books from the library at Beaufort, S. C.

 
Legare, Hugh Swinton

 

Legare also discussed the possibility of
giving away some books from his own extensive
collection. He complained to Elliott that
Charleston, S. C., was declining in moral and
intellectual excellence.

J. T. Reid wrote on Mar. 7, 1842, concerning
a legal case being tried. Legaré, then
Attorney General, wrote Commodore John B.
Nicholson to decline an invitation. Legaré
noted that the number of cases in which he was
involved was so large that he doubted if they

 
Legaré, Hugh Swinton

 

5
could all be tried as early as they should be
(Feb. 20, 1843).

1 item added, 2-27-67, is a letter by John
Stevens Cogdell (1778-1847) to Congressman Hugh
Swinton Legaré of South Carolina. Cogdell, a
sculptor and painter as well as a lawyer, wrote
briefly concerning a number of subjects, all of
which concern the career of Legaré or himself.
He begins by condemning the murder of U.S.
Senator Jonathan Cilley by Congressman William
J. Graves. He next mentions Legaré's mother
and sister, who were very dear to his (Legaré's

 
Legaré, Hugh Swinton 6
heart. This is followed by comment on the
program of Mayor Henry Laurens Pinckney to cove
the streets of Charleston with shells. Finally
he writes of Legare’s Subtreasury Bill, an
unsuccessful measure proposed in opposition to
the legislation establishing an Independent
Treasury.

 

Cogdell, a sculptor of note, was accumulating
funds to return to Europe to study. He had
invested this money in a New York bank. In his
letter to Legaré he asks about introductions to
U.S. diplomatic officers abroad. Apparently it

 
Legaré, Hugh Swinton 7
was after this date, Feb. 24, 1530, that his
investment was wiped out in the bank failures
of the panic of 1837-1839.

Cogdell, whose works exemplify the early
period in American sculpture, presented a cast
of his bust of General Moultrie of South
Carolina to Congress. He asks in his letter

 

that Hugh Legaré send an enclosed letter to
George Cooke (1794-1849) in the "painting room"
at the Capitol in Washington. Cooke, a portrait
painter as well as an historical and landscape
artist, was in Washington from 1837 until 1839.

Hugh Swinton Legaré was a lawyer, writer,
chargé d'affaires in Brussels, 1832-1836, member
of the U.S. House of Representatives, 1837-1839,
U.S. Attorney general, 1841-1843, and U.S. Sec-
retary of State, May 9, 1843, until his sudden

death on June 30, 1843.

The collection begins while Legaré is in
Brussels. Thomas Aspinwall wrote to him from
London, offering to supply him with wines and

 
‘Legaré, Hugh Swinton. 2
anything else he might wish him to purchase for
him. He mentioned having received from Paris

a letter from their mutual friend, Gen. John

Ellis Wool, who was then examining European mil
itary establishments, and that the feeling among
the Tories and merchants of England was that it
was to her best interests not to go to war with

 

Holland despite the Dutch King's warlike speech,
He also spoke of the continuing British naval
preparations, and of reforms that were to be
made in the Church of England.

 
Legaré, Hugh Swinton. 3
While he was in the House of Representatives,
Legaré received from T. Hamilton of Charleston
a letter, stating that he knew only two people
in the city who supported the subtreasury bill.
The three letters of Frederick Grimké, a native
of Charleston and a close friend of Legaré, span
the period, Dec. 10, 1837, to May 18, 1838. He

 

was then a judge in the Ohio Supreme Court, and
was a brother of the famous Sisters, Angelina
Emily and Sarah Moore Grimké. In his first let-
ter he praised Legaré for a recent speech he had
delivered in Congress, criticized most of the

 
taaaré, Hugh swinton. 4

 

Speeches in Congress, asked him to send him a
copy of each speech he delivered, and inquired
as to whether George McDuffie had left public
life. He praised him as a great orator. In his
second letter Grimké praised another of Legaré' s
speeches, and in both of his first two letters
he compared oratory in Congress with famous

speeches by Britishers and Frenchmen, stressing
the importance to intelligent citizens in this

country of the quality of speeches of members of
Congress. He commented on his belief that there
was a party in the South led by John C. Calhoun

 
Legaré, Hugh Swinton.

that had long been determined to divide the
country, and said he felt that Southern leaders
had been remiss in not opposing the abolition-
ists more effectively. He went on to describe
the kinds of people who had become abolition-
ists. The subtreasury bill he said he support-
ed. In his last letter he wrote of the terrible

 

recent fire in Charleston, and of his conviction
that Daniel Webster's powers as a speaker had
declined. He asked his opinion of the state of
society and learning in Germany and his view of
Immanuel Kant's philosophy.

 
Legaré, Hugh Swinton. 6
On November 17, 1840, just after being elec-
ted governor of Ohio, Thomas Corwin, a former
member of the House of Representatives, wrote
to Legaré. He spoke of the limited power of the
governor in that state, of their victories in
Congress over the "robbers," and of the popular
ity of Legaré's "Athenian Democracy" that had

 

appeared in the New York Review. He also said
he would acquaint Gen. William Henry Harrison
with how Legaré had supported him in his presi-

 

dential race.

 
Legaré, Hugh Swinton, 7
Legaré's friend, Benjamin Chew Howard, and
his wife of Baltimore; invited Legaré to the
wedding of their daughter on June 1, 1841. Two
letters written from New York in March, 1842, b
Charles Augustus Davis give Legaré his views on
the national fiscal policy, currency problems,
and the need of tariff protection to build up

 

home industries. He spoke of the economic
effect on the United States of the reversion of
European countries to peacetime activities.

John Soviner Graham in New York expressed his

 
Legaré, Hugh Swinton.

 

pleasure to Legaré over his having become Secre
tary of State in 1843. Soon after Legaré' s
death, his sister Mary Swinton Legaré,wrote to
John H. Ried in Washington, asking if he would
present to James Louis Petigru her desire that
he compile a volume of her brother's addresses
and writings and write a sketch of him to intro
duce the volume. Such a volume was published a
few years later, but it was edited by Mary Swin
ton Legaré Bullen.

in his opinion, the foremost magazine of

According to the longest letter in the

Legg, Emma A. Papers, 1861-1864. Auburn,
Worcester Co., Mass.

These are the Civil -War letters of the Legg
brothers - Charles A., William Howard, and
Luther D. - sons of William and Emma Legg of
Auburn, Mass. The brothers were members of an
average New England farm community of the 1860's,
as is revealed by their letters home. Most of

 

the letters are those of Charles Legg, who
served through three enlistments from 1861 to
1865. William, a second Legg son, enlisted in
August of 1862 in order to join his brother. He

 
Lege, Emma A. a
was fated to die of disease in Virginia only
five months later. Luther, a third son, served
through a one-year enlistment from 1862 to 1863.

Charles Legg (born March 14, 1840), entered
service as a private in Company B, Third
Battalion, Mass. Rifles, serving from April of
1861 to August 3 of the same year. His two

 

letters during this period were written from
Baltimore. Duty was confined to Fort McHenry.
On Sept. 17, 1861, he joined Co. C of the First
Mass. Volunteer Cavalry. It is with this unit

 
Legg, Emma A, 3
that he remains until his final release early
in 1865 after having been promoted to sergeant
the previous year.

February 12, 1862, finds Charles at Hilton
Head, South Carolina, where he writes to his
brother William of disillusionment with dishon-
est army contractors and quartermasters. At
this stage of the war he blames parties in both
North and South as Sharing equal responsibility
for the conflict. Resentment is also directed
against Negroes, some of whom seem to be

 

 
Legg, Emma A. 4
receiving better food and treatment than enlisted
men. Later, in camp, he reports that the sound
of firing can be heard from nearby Fort Pulaski.
A July 26, 1862, letter continues to criticize
Negroes, and mentions the controversial Negro
policy of Gen. David Hunter. En route to Fort-
ress Monroe, he writes of the urgent need for

 

"fighting Generals and fighting men and lots of
them ...." He has learned that William is soon
to be a cavalryman in the Mass. First, and will
join the regiment soon. A month later news has

 
Legg, Emma A. 5

come that Luther Legg has followed the example
of his two older brothers by enlisting. Charles
believing that two "fools" in the family are
enough, is astonished and grieved that this
action had not been prevented. He is doubtful
that Luther will be able to endure the hardships
of army life. The bounty money of the three

 

brothers is to be used for repairs on the Legg
home and farm.

The details of Luther's enlistment can be
covered briefly. He served as a drummer in the

 
Lege, Emma A. 6
Fifty-first Mass. Vol. Inf. from Sept., 1362, to
July, 1863. His few army letters are addressed
from New Bern and Beaufort, North Carolina, and
apvarently he saw no action. He does, however,
mention the need of a pistol to protect himself
while on picket duty. At the termination of his
enlistment, he was stricken with typhoid fever

 

and briefly hosvitalized in Baltimore before

returning home.
September and October of 1862 find William
Legg in New York and Washington. By November,

 
Legg, Emma A. 7
both brothers are together with the regiment at
Hagerstown. During the Battle of Fredericks-
burg, William is laid low with jaundice and out
of touch with war news. William shows the same
resentment against Negroes as Charles, and for
the same reason = supvosed preferential treat-
ment.

 

Although the First Mass. Cavalry (on bivouac
in the vicinity), did not participate in the
Battle of Fredericksburg, Charles writes gloomil
that ™...the splendid army that went over the

 
Lege, Emma A. 8
river a few days ago has come back sadly cut up
and dispirited in the extreme ..." By January
discouragement has increased, as the Army of the
Potomac bogs down in “knee deep" mud. With
teams unable to move through the muck, the
mounted cavalry are given the task of transpor-
ting provisions to Burnside's army.

In addition to the discouragement of Union
defeats, Charles - during the winter of 1863 -
has additional cause for concern: a sick brother.
William is seriously ill, and dies on February %

 

 
Legg, Emma A. 9
1663. Charles evidently returned to Auburn on
brief furlough, as his letter of February 23
mentions his safe arrival to his company. A
following letter mentions, with indignation, the
offer by Auburn, Mass., to pay for William's
funeral. This, Charles exclaims, would be no
better than a paupers burial. He has himself

 

paid the expenses.

On March 17, the First Mass. Cavalry met the
Confederate cavalry at Kelly's Ford, a “most
brilliant cavalry expedition," which ended ina

 
Legg, Emma A. 10
Confederate rout. By March 25, the Army of the
Potomac has found a new hero in Gen. Joseph
Hooker, but by May 7 Charles is writing bof his
disillusionment. General John Sedgewick is men-
tioned as guilty of a possible indiscretion at
Chanceéllorsville.

After fighting at Aldie, Va., and Gettysburg,

 

Charles'spirits have soared once again. The
regiment has suffered heavily at Aldie in June
(not described here), and at the time of Gettys-
burg was assigned to Gen. Sedgewick's Sixth

 
Legg, Emma A. poe
Corps. The First was not engaged in major action
during this campaign, although it met Lee's
cavalry in a brief engagement at Jones Cross
Roads on July ll.

Headquarters of the regiment, from Aug. 15 to
the middle of Sept., was in bivouac at Waterloo
and Orleans, in the rear of Plum Run, and pic-

 

keting was done along the run. It was at Orleans
while in picket duty, that Charles was captured
and taken to Richmond, where he was briefly in-
carcerated at Libby Prison. A letter of Sept.

 
Legg, Emma A. iz
16 reveals that he is at Annapolis waiting to be
exchanged. By October he has rejoined his reg-
iment.

Letters of December, 1863 through the Spring
of 1364, reveal glimpses of the engagements of
the First Regiment - a skirmish at Parker's
Store (in Dec.), and the 1864 (May) Wilderness
Campaign in Virginia. It is during or after the
engacement at Drewry's Bluff, on May 16, that
Charles is promoted to sergeant. On June 3 and
4 he tells of the great loss of life that

 

 
Legg, Emma A. 43
has occurred at Cold Harbor. Ina letter of
June 17, he describes troop movements before
Petersburg and the taking of Confederate prison-
ers. His letter of July 17 describes the
Confederate position in front of the Union Fifth
Corps, during a temporary truce (agreed upon by
the soldiers themselves). Elsewhere along the
line firing continues.

The letters of Charles Legg end abruptly in
the fall of 1864, but records reveal that he was
mustered out of the service on Jan. 29, 1865.

 

 
Legg, Emma A. 14
For an excellent history of his regiment, see
A History of the First Regiment of Massachusetts
Cavalry Volunteers by B.W. Crowninshield (Bostor
Houghton Mifflin Yo., 1891). Of special interest
are the photographs of William and Charles Legg
(opposites pages 332 and 344). The same
photograph of Charles (with a brief sketch) is
found in Minute Men of '61 by George W. Nason
(pace 283). This sketch mentions that Charles
was made Color Sergeant, serving with his com-
pany at Gen. Mead's headquarters of the Army of
he Potomac for escort and orderly duty.

Two business letters by B. W. Leigh, Sr.
about legal affairs: on May 21, 1826, he writes
to William Branch Giles, future Gov. of Va.,
about various matters, including getting certain
papers from a Mr. Nash. On the back of this

 

letter is a note by Giles to Nash about the
same papers.

Leigh, on Oct. 16, 1846, replies to a letter
from Thomas J. Gholson about the case of Moss
vs. Green, and his own illness.

4 items added 11-20-51. The first two items

 
 

Leigh, benjamin Watkins, Sr. on Z
are to B.W. Leigh, Sr. from Edward Colston,

who had served with Leigh in the Virginia House
of Delegates from 1811 to 1813, or there abouts
Colston was a U. S. Representative from Va.
from 1817 to 1819. See M. H. and A, H, Gardine
Chronicles of Old Berkeley, p. 226; and L. G.

105. Letae’s second wife was Susan Calsten, ,

niece of Chief Justice John Marshall. Colston
was perhaps her brother.. See L. P. oe er iee?
Some Prominent Virginia Families, II 70-47
Colston mentions a Susan in both letters. He

 
Leigh, Benjamin Watkins Sr. a
was serving in the Va. Militia in 1813 when
these letters were written.

On Apr. 19 he writes about the attitude of
some Virginians toward the war. He writes from
Norfolk on June 24 about a recent engagement
with the British near there. The loss of the

 

U. S. S. Chesapeake near Boston on the lst could
have been avenged near Norfolk on the 20th, so
he says, if a breeze had not unfortunately
sprung up to hamper the assault upon the British
ships by American gunboats. Nevertheless, the
enemy lost about 70 killed and wounded; among

 
Leigh, Benjamin Watkins Sr. 4

 

the former was the Captain. On the 2lst the
British came in great force and the next @y
attacked Crary Island. The first British pro-
duced great, though momentary, consternation
among the Va. Militia. But when it was obser-
ved that none had been injured, the Militiamen

were no more afraid of the rockets than if they
had contained no explosives.

Colston proceeds to describe those weapons
which were to be publicized the following year
in Francis Scott Key's "The Star Spangled Ban-
ner." The rockets are brass tubes about two

 
Leigh, Benjamin Watkins Sr. 5
and one half feet long and about eight inches in
circumference filled with hand grenades and
Small shells which burst as they fly and scatter
death about them.

The enemy, Colston continues, landed on
Crary Island and advanced about 400 yards when

 

our artillery fire compelled them to recoil.

He speaks of the dastardly conduct of the Bri-
tish troops under the command of Gen. Sir Thomas
Sydney Beekwith (1772-1831). Admirals Sir Geo-
rge Cockburn (1792-1853) and Sir John Borlase
Warren, Jr. (1753-1822) were present. A British

 
Leigh, Benyamin Watkins, Sr. 6
barge was sunk, about 300 men were killed, and
others were captured. While some gave the U.SS.
Constitution credit for the day's action, the
Va. Militia's artillery did equally wll.

The other two items are letters from B. W.
Leigh, Jr. (1812- ) to James T, Alexander.

 

 

On Aug. 4, 1852, he mentions Hickey's edition of
the U. S. Constitution. Leigh writes on Apr.29,
1853, that he is sailing to Cal. on the U. S. S.
Union. He is to cross the Isthmus of Panama on
land, partly by railroad and partly by mule, and
take the U. S. S. Winfield Scott from the Paci-

fic side to Cal. He has heard that Alexander is
going to live in Miss.

3 items added 11-9157. A receipt of 1821
Signed by B. W. Leigh, Sr.; a letter of Apr. 23,

granted as a reward for Revolutionary services;
and a personal note of Jan. 6, 1839 from Leigh
to a Dr. Watkins.

Salem N. C. Letters 1832-1865 70 pieces

 

These letters centering around Edward
William Linebach are chiefly family and war
letters. The war letters are good as to
details concerning life in the Confederate
army. Beginning in June of 1862 the 48 war

letters were for the most part written by
Charles I. Clandler and James Linebach.
The letters from 1832 to 1862 were chiefly

written by Edward William Linebach.

iyo collection is concerned chiefly with the

 

familyof Colonel Thomas Lenoir (1780-1861), es-
pecially with his children; William AveryLenoir
(1808-62), Selina Louisa (Lenoir) Pickens, Laura

Lenoir (1817-82), Mary Ann(Lenoir) Gwynn (1819~

Lenoir (1823-90), and Rufus T, Lenoir (1825-1912)
Ineluded also are some family letters of General

Lenoir, [For complete data on genealogy see

and Genealogy, Chapel Hill, 1940.]

Some of the earlier papers favolve around
General William Lenoir including deeds, receipts
records of notes with amounts and dates of ma-

turity, a stud book of Whirligig for 1791, and
letters. Five letters to William Lenoir from hi

 

 

brother-in-law, John Wall Norwood (1727-1802) of
Franklin County, N.C., are concerned with family
affairs and public matters including, among the
latter, political situations in France and Eng?

land and the spread of deism in North Carolina,

 
LENOIR -3-
Concerning the latter, Norwood declared in 1798,
‘that "a parson...said to be a man of Education,
preached in favor of it [deitsm] some timepast,
at Halifax, Warrenton, and Wmsborough in Gransil
ville [all in N.C.J". According to Norwood the
discourse was favorably reveived by "most of the
Rich, the fashionable and polite... >" although
he did not approve of deism. One letter from
Lewis Williams to Lenoir contains a discussion
of Jones' Defense of North Carolina.

The bulk of the papers concerned with Colonel

Thos. Lenoir consist of letters from His children

and records pertaining to the settlement of the
estate of General Wm. Lenoir, his father, There
are occasional letters from Wm. Ballard Lenoir
(1781-1855), brother of Col. Thos. Lenoir, writ-
ten from Lenoir, Roane Co., Tenn. There are al-
so letters to him from his sons, Rufus Theodore,
and Walter Waightstill, while the latter were
students at the U. of N. C, during the late
1830's and early '40's. There are akse nume-
rous letters from other members of the family
not only to Thos. Lenoir but also to his wife

Selina Louisa (

Probably the most important series of letters
in the collection was written by Thos. Isaac
Lenoir, son of Colonel Thomas Lenoir, to various
members of the family relative to farming opera~
tions in Haywood county where he operated a
stock farm during the 1840's and 1850's, and la-
ter, except for the Civil War period, during
which time he served in the Confederate Army. The
letters, usually regular, tell much of local hap
penings in the area west of Asheville, with
frequent mention of people living in that area

including tenants on Col. Thos.Lenoir's land,

 
LENOIR -6-__
tenants on Thos, Isaac Lenoir's landnd leading
figures in that part of North Carolina. His
letters, however, are chiefly valuable because
of his detailed analyses of farming operations
in Haywood County. He mentioned the Indians of
that section, on one oceaston during 1860 re-
ferring to theIddian ball game as an event to
draw hosts of people.

There are also many family letters from the &
Gwynns, Pickens of South Carolina, and a later
branch of the Norwood family (Joseph Caldwell

Norwood, 181§-94)

all of whom had married into

The most interesting series of letters in the
collection following the Civil War was written
by Walter Waightsi11 Lenoir from Crab Orchard,
probably in Haywood County and Shulls Mills,
Watauga County, North Carolina. Immediately
following the War, he oocasionally commented on
N, C. politics, referring ‘n one letter, Holden
and the dishonest role of the Methodist Church
in N. C. politics during 1866, His papers also

include business letters and occasional trea
tises on diseases of i

his sons while at the U. of N. C. during the
late 1870's, several\letters from Julia A, Oer-
tel, wife of an Episcopal minister and artist
who moved from Bavaria, Germany, to Caldwell
Co., N.C.; several of her letters, during the
early 1880's, tell of orange groves at Orange
Spring, Marion County, Mha, A numberpf them
were written from Sewanee, Tennessee. She also
wrote often from Grace Rectory in Morganton,
