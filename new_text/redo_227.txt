Va, 52 items Sketch.

 

Isaiah H. White was born in Accomack County,
Va., July 24, 1838, the son of Samuel C. White
(1799-1888). He received his M. D, from the
Medical College of Virginia in 1861, entering
the Confederate Army in April, 1862, as assis-

tant surgeon at Chimborazo Hospital in Richmond.
In July, 1862, he became surgeon of the 14th
Louisiana Infantry, Army of Northern Virginia.
When the prison at Camp Sumter, Andersonville, -
Ga., opened in Feb., 1864, Dr, White was appoin
ed surgeon of this “eo: prison's hospital.

 
White, Isaiah H, _ ; 2

 

His papers open with a copy of General Or-
ders No. 95 by Gen. Samuel Cooper on Nov. 25,
1862, to make better provision for the sick and
wounded in the Confederacy, In May, 1864, he
was placed by the Surgeon General Samuel P,
Moore in charge of the guard and prison at And-
ersonville. Crowded conditions there forced

Gen. John Henry Winder to locate a new military
prison, Camp Lawton, near Millen, Ga., in Aug-
ust - October, 1864, His General Order No. 82,
Oct. 6, 1864, places Surgeon R. R. Stevenson in
charge of the garrison quarters, possibly med-

sonnel to Camp Lawton. By Oct., 1864, Dr. White
was acting as Chief Surgeon and Inspector of

C, S. Military Hospitals in Ga, and Ala., with
headquarters at Camp Lawton. Col. Geo. C, Gibbs
of Camp Sumter issues orders revealing camp rou-
tine of the Andersonville garrison. General Or-

ders No. 84 (a copy). is sent to Surgeon R, R,
Stevenson, announcing the appointment of General
Winder as Commissary General of Prisons east of
the Mississippi River, Nov., 1864, His General
Orders No. 2 announces change of headquarters

 
White, Isaiah H,
from Columbia, S.C,, to Augusta, Ga. About Nov.

1, Surgeon White was ordered to Richmond, Va.,
to aid in construction of hospital accomoda-
tions. He had made a strong plea for funds for
prison hospitals which he had not been able to
get from the Commissary and Quartercmaster de-
partments. When Winder became Commissary Gener-
al of Prisons, he evidently brought Dr. White
back to Georgia, where he became Chief Surgeon
of hospitals attached to military prisons east
of the Mississippi River. His first duty was to
relieve Savannah of a large number of sick, tak-

 

 
White, Isaiah H, 5

(General Orders No. 5) to inspect hospitals at
Salisbury, N.C., and Columbia, S.C.
Dr. White began to "0. Cura of Sa from sur-

 

geons, such as Richard 0. Cur of Salisbury on
Dec. 22, 1864, on sanitary conditions in their
commands. Thos. L. Ogier, Medical Director of

trative details at Winder's office as chief med-
ical officer of prisons. He calls on all sur-
geons in charge of military prison hospitals fo
reports, ca. Jan. 10, 1865. Octavius White
gives the plan of organization for the military
hospital at Florence, S.C. Reports and accounts

come to Dr. White from Columbia, S.C., Anderson-

John W. White, merchant, operated a general
store at Middletown. He opened his business in
the autumn of 1865 when he began John W. White
& Co.'s Ledger A, 1865-1868, that is in this
collection. Ledger A (256 ff.) was used ex-

tensively during 1865-1867. Entries for 1868
are numerous but not as numerous as those for
the earlier years, There are a small number of
scattered entries for 1869 and 1870, usually

 
White, John W, 2

 

settlements entered on old accounts. There is
at least one notation (f: 189) in which an
account is noted as being forwarded to the "New
Ledger," an indication that the business
continued and that Ledger B was in use probably
as early as 1868. Although entries in Ledger A

were posted into it from a daybook, the accounts
in Ledger A still contain considerable detail
about the transactions, goods purchased, prices,
etc. Customers paid their bills with goods and
services as well as with cash,

 
White, John W, 3

 

The. two other account books are not volumes
that were used in a real business. They are
exercise books used in the study of bookkeeping.
This conclusion is suggested by the notation in
Exercise Book I, "Book Keeping and Penmanship
by Charles White, Middletown, Md., February

Seventeenth, 1858." The contents of both
volumes illustrate a variety of account book
forms, and dates and places vary. A particular-
ly interesting aspect of these volumes is that
both belonged, at least in part, to George C.

 
White, John W. 5
of the volumes,

Accounting Exercise Book I has such sections
as: Daybook Double Entry; Day Book or Blotter;
Index to Day-Book; Journal; Index to the Ledger,
Merchant's Form; Bank Book, etc. George C.
White's name and the date of March 15, 1858,

 

appear on the front cover. Penmanship practice

is evident on some pages, and both volumes are
written in fine hands.

Accounting Exercise Book II includes such
sections as: Day-Book, Mechanic's Form; Index

 
White, John W. 4
White whose name appears on them, once with the
date 1858. There is an account for George C.
White in Ledger A (ff. 63, 184, 208) in which
successive monthly wages are recorded. He
worked in the store and not many years after he
used these bookkeeping exercise books. The
source of these exercises is not indicated. It

 

is possible that these exercise books were
written and used by more than one student,
especially George C. White and Charles Edwin C.
White both of whose names appear in at least one

ter, Merchant's Form; Index to the Day Book;
Journal, Merchant's Form; examples of a pro-
missory note, receipt, joint note; etc. This
volume also presumably dates from about 1858.

Sketch, :

em is a 36-page typescript copy of the
autobiography of Josiah White (1781-1850) under

the title of Josiah White's History Given
Himself. This booklet is no. 6 oF copies
printed privately ca. 1909 by, presumably, the

Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. It is liste

 

in the Library of Congress catalogue of printed
cards. It relates to the circumstances which
led to the introduction of canal navigation and
the use of anthracite coal in Pa. This booklet
may have been written in 186.

White tells about : jens to a

 
 

Philadelphia hardware merchant, whose business
adventures and misadventures are duly chronicled
In 1802, White establishes his own hardware

store in Philadelphia, After early reverses,

he prospers and ca. 1808, having made his plan-
ned retirement fund of $40,000, sells out and re
tires,

He then travels to Ga. with a planter friend
who is kindly received by his slaves there,
on the whole, concludes white Northerners are
better off than Southern Slaveowners. In some
parts of the South patrols are established to
prevent slave uprisings i only a third of the

 
White, Josiah
Blacks are prime hands.

In 1810 White buys the falls of the Schuylkil
River for $14,000 to develope its water power s
encounters financial difficulties for some seven
years. In 1812-1813, he petitions the Pa. legis
lature to improve the river, and a bill is passed
in 1614-1815. He sells seven-sixteenths of his
interest in the falls. In 1819 he selis out for
a big profit and pays his debts. Meanwhile he
has acquired a wife and children.

With two business associates, one of whom
turns out to be dishonest, White leases the
Lehigh Mine Company's r coal lands in

 

 
 

le caused by the crook 1s re-
counted in detail. In 1820 the undesirable col-
league gets out, and his remaining claims are
later bought by the Lehigh Coal and Navigation

White's scheme is to mine the old anthracite
081 lands and send the foal on rafts down the
shigh River, which must first be made navigable
y small wing dams, channel walls, etc., to Phil-

adelphia, where interest in coal as a fuel to re-
place wood must be stimulated. A number of pro-
minent Philadelphia businessmen and others as

elldecline to invest r i scheme, Stephen

 
White, Josiah. 5

 

Girard, John Rodgers, Count Joseph Bonaparte,
Jacob Cist, the Stille family in Philadelphia,
and others are mentioned. But still others do
invest and White finally succeeds. In 1820

the coal mining company and the navigation come
pany are amalgamated under the title of the Le-
high Coal and Navigation Company, which is char
tered in 1822,

In 1823 almost 6,000 tons of anthracite coal
go on rafts down the Lehigh River to Philadele
phia. During the next two years sales of coal
and coal stoves there soar, and more coal goes

 
White, Josiah.

 

there to meet the increased demand.

White's next project is to improve upstream
navigation, so that boats can replace rafts.
Construction of the Lehigh Canal is accordingly

begun in 1827 under the direction of the eng
Canvass White,

Meanwhile in 1823-182) the Lehigh Coal and
Navigation Company requests the Pa. Legislature
to improve the Delaware River. In 1828, con-
tractors for the State begin work on the Dela-
ware division of the Pennsylvania Canal. Since

they do a bad job, "a are replaced by Josiah

 
White, Josiah.

White, who, by overhauling a large part of the
division, completes the job satisfactorily in
1832, whereupon the Lehigh Canal, which is com-
pleted in 1829, can be used.

Gov. John Andrew Schulze of Pa. grants autho:
ity to charge tolls in 1829. Beginning in 1832
the anthracite coal traffic on the Lehigh River
greatly expands. In 1837 Gov. George Wolf of
Pa, authorizes tolls on an up-river extension o
the canal,

In 1841 a flocd causes engineering and finan
cial difficulties to the Lehigh Coal and Navi-

Gation Company. The company arranges a mort-
gage in this year and is still operating under
it in 1846, the apparent date of composition of
the booklet.

White concludes his account with a list of
his inventions, including rolled nails, cast
iron plates to draw wire, shéét iron boats,
wire fences, wire bridges, the system of slack
water navigetion, and the balance lock.

contain information about local politics, relig-

William F, White (1831- ) was an officer i
the U.S. Army during the Civil War. ge ogg |
he had been a sergeant in Company B of the 38t
Infantry Regiment, but in April, 1862, he was
promoted to first lieutenant in that company. In

February, 1863, he was promoted to the rank of
captain and elected captain of Company B. White
had had considerable illness while in the Army
and for that reason was assigned to the 56th Com-
pany, lst Battalion of the Invalid Corps in Sep-

 
White, William F, 2
tember, 1863. More specific details on White's
promotions are given in Report of the Adjutant
General of the State of Titincis- (Vol. III, p.78),
In his diary, y, the entry for Aug. 11, 1864, notes
that he is in Company E, Facts in the diary,
such as mention of Major John B,. Callis and Colo-
nel George W. Gile, indicate that White was in
the lst Brigade, 7th Regiment of the Veteran Re-
serve Corps, the successor to the Invalid Corps.
This Brigade was stationed in Washington, D. C.
as was White. He was married and had children.

 

 
White, William F.

The volume is a diary covering the period from
Dec. 26, 1862 to Dec. 31, 1864. In 1862 and part
of 1863, White was stationed in various places i
Tennessee, Although the 38th Illinois Regiment
was not engaged in any major battles during this
time, White mentioned several skirmishes with
Confederate troops. He also gave the names of

 

other regiments with which he was fighting, such
as the 21st Illinois, the 10lst Ohio, and the
15th Wisconsin. Much of the diary is devoted to
the day-to-day activities of an army officer:
picket duty, inspections, drills, foraging, and

marching.

 
White, William F, 4

 

Of particular interest are copies of a report
by Lt. Col. Daniel H, Gilmer and of orders by
Col. William P, Carlin. Gilmer's report de-
scribes the activities of the 38th Illinois Regi
ment in December, 1862 and January, 1863. The
other document tells of the heroic accomplish-
ments of the 2nd Brigade, lst Division (including

the 38th Illinois) , during the same period.

See Col, Gilmer's report in the Official Re-
cords, Series I, Vol. XXIII, Pt. 2, pp. 969-970,
which covers the military activities described b
White in his diary on June 25-26, 1863.

 
White, William F,. 5
In September, 1863, White reported to the
Invalid Corps in Louisville, Kentucky. The next

month the 56th and 62nd Companies moved to Camp
Chase, Ohio, where they served primarily on guard
duty at the prison there,

White was transferred to Washington, D.C. in
May, 1864, and served at Fort Bunker Hill, Fort
Totten, and Rush Barracks. The diary from May to
December of that year is concerned primarily with
White's duties as Field Officer of the Day and
on guard duty at prisons and bridges.

 

 
White, William F, 6

A long newspaper clipping was pasted in the
diary at the end, It gives the appointments by
the President in the U.S. Army in 1863 and 1864.
White's name is listed in that clipping on page
230 of the diary for appointment as captain.

See the accession record for this collection
for an explanation of how the author of the
diary was identified.

George Whitefield was a-leading Methodist
clergyman and evangelist. He was instrumental
in establishing the Calvinistic Methodist
societies in Great Britain and in fomenting the
Great Awakening in America. His preaching

missions and philanthropic activities led him

to travel extensively throughout Great Britain
and her American colonies. His abilities as a
preacher inspired many to religious affirmation
He died during one of his evangelistic crusades

 
Whitefield, George 2

 

in Newburyport, Mass., and was buried there.

On March 1, 1750, Whitefield wrote an
unidentified friend a letter in which he dis-
cussed religious affairs in Georgia and South
Carolina, praised James Habersham for his
activities in Georgia, and expressed support fo
preaching missions to Negroes.

In a letter of Dec. 14, 1759, to John
Ryland, a leading Baptist clergyman, Whitefield
praised a young man for his Christian dedication

A miscellaneous item is a short commentary

on an unidentified passage from the Bible.

Whitener, Basil Lee

 

of Commerce, serving aS organizer and first

the North Carolina Junior Chamber of Commerce
during the early 1940s. From 1938 to 1940, he

North Carolina House of Representatives in 1941.
Although he was renominated in 1942, he resigned

Whitener, Basil Lee 3
from the Navy with the rank of Lieutenant, USNR,
on November 6, 1945.

After the war, Whitener served as Solicitor
of the 14th Solicitorial District from 1946 to
1956. In addition, he wasSa member of various
organizations and commissions during this period.
For example, he was a member of the North

 

Carolina General Statutes Commission (1946) and
of the Commission to Study Improvement of Adminis
tration of Justice (1947-1949). Whitener served
as President of the Young Democratic Clubs of

 
Whitener, Basil Lee 4
North Carolina (1946-1947). He served in

several capacities in the Young Democratic Clubs
of America: Chairman of the Speakers' Bureau
(1948-1949), Chairman of the Advisory Committee
(1949-1951), and Chairman of the Board of Region-
al Directors (1951). He also was Permanent Chair-
man of the Young Democratic National Convention

 

in 1949 and President of the. Gaston County Bar
Association in 1950. Whitener was a delegate
to the Democratic National Convention in both

1948 and 1960.

 
Whitener, Basil Lee

From 1957 to 1968, Whitener served as a
Democrat in Congress. He was elected as Re-
presentative for the Eleventh District of North
Carolina (85th Congress, 1957 - 87th Congress,
1962) and for the Tenth District of North Caro-
lina (88th Congress, 1963 - 90th Congress, 1968)

sumed the practice of law in Gastonia, N.C.

 
Whitener, Basil Lee 6

Whitener has been a member of several civic
and fraternal organizations, such as Kiwanis,
Elks, American Legion, and the Shriners. In
eddition, he was awarded the honorary LL. D.
degree both from Belmont Abbey College in 1960
and from Pfeiffer College in 1965. Whitener
married Harriet Priscilla Morgan on September 26,
1942, and they have four children.

This collection consists primarily of the
office files of Whitener as congressman, 1957-
1968. Also, there are some files of Whitener's

 

 
Whitener, Basil Lee 7

 

predecessor, Woodrow Wilson Jones, 1950-1957.
There are information and opinions on a variety
of issues of national importance during the
1960s. Included are the Vietnam War, crime
legislation, gun control, riots, civil rights
legislation, foreign aid, Social Security, and
the Taft-Hartley Act. Other subjects are the
U.S. Congress and various bills and laws. There
are a variety of letters from prominent persons,
such as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy,

Sargent Shriver, Strom Thurmond, and Sam Ervin.

 
Whitener, Basil Lee 8
The views of Whitener on many national and
state issues are revealed within the collection.
In general, Whitener seemed to exhibit the views
of conservative Southern Democrats. For further
information on these issues and specific sub-
jects, please consult the inventory. The in-
ventory is filed in the Inventory File drawer.

 

 

Included in the papers are such items as
correspondence, printed material, invitations,
speeches, clippings, financial papers, photo-
graphs, as well as legislative materials and

 
Whitener, Basil Lee 9

 

drafts of bills. Much of this collection con-
sists of correspondence between Whitener and his
constituents, other congressmen, and government
officials.

By far the largest category is the Corre-
spondence (General), even though it was weeded
extensively. The Correspondence (Legislative)

Series is also rather large. Both of these
series contain extensive correspondence with

constituents. Other large series are the
Personal Series, which pertains more directly to

 
Whitener, Basil Lee 10

 

Whitener's private and unofficial affairs, and
the Office Files Series, containing files which
seem to have been in active use by Whitener's
office staff at the time he left office.

The arrangement of the Whitener Papers has
followed the system originally used by the
Congressman's office as much as possible. In
some cases, rearrangement of the order was
necessary to create a logical organization,
whether it be chronological, subject, or some
other arrangement. Although categories do

 
Whitener, Basil Lee Ld

 

indicate the contents of folders, headings are
not always inclusive. Subject and autograph

cards have been prepared for the card catalog
but are very selective.

Whiting, William Henry Chase, Papers. Biloxi,
Harrison County, Mississippi

 

William Henry Chase Whiting (1824-1865),
army officer, was born in Biloxi, Mississippi.
He was a graduate both of Georgetown College in
Washington, D. C, and the U.S, Military Academy.
Kate D, Walker was his wife. In 1845 he was

appointed a second lieutenant in the U.S, Corps
of Engineers and participated in various con-
struction, fortification, and harbor improvement
projects, After resigning from the U.S, Army

 
Whiting, William Henry Chase 2
to join the Confederate Army in 1861, Whiting
planned the defenses for Charleston harbor and
Morris Island; was the military commander of
Wilmington, N. C.; was sent to take command at
St. Petersburg, Florida; and rose to the rank of

major general, He was mortally wounded at Fort
Fisher, N. C.

 

The item is an undated note to Whiting from
Lt. John Davenport, asking what the result of
the explosion of the "powder boat" was.
According to Boatner in The Civil War Dictionary,

 

 
Whiting, William Henry Chase 3
the purpose of the "powder boat" had been for
it to explode and thus destroy either Fort
Fisher or the troops there, Whiting wrote a
reply on the verso of the note to the effect
that the scheme was a failure. Since the event
occurred on December 23, 1864, this note was
probably written in early January, 1865 or

 

possibly late in December, 1864.

XVII-B 3 volumes

Whitney, Henry B. Diary, 1862-1865. Pulaski,
Oswego County, New York.

 

The volumes constitute a diary. The
diarist, a U.S. Army goldier, Henry B. Whitney,
was born on May 2, 1838(entry of May 2, 1863)
and lived in Pulaski, New York (entry of May 2,
1864). Sometimes he writes about his wife

(unidentified). On May 25, 1863, he tells
about the death of his son, Charles. Otherwise
there is not much information about his family
or background.

The diary runs from August 13, 1862, to
December 26, 1865. Whitney was inducted into

 
Whitney, Henry B. 2

the army about August, 1862, and assigned to
the 110th Regiment of New York Infantry Volun-
teers. He was discharged in September, 1865.
It is not clear what was his unit during the
latter part of his army career, but he was

in the 110th at least until October,1864.
There is some discussion of the regimental
commander, De Witt Clinton Littlejohn.

Whitney discussed army chaplains and civilia
preachers. On December 10, 1865, he heard
Rev. Mr. Green, of Auburn, New York, a Negro
preacher, presumably Baptist.

 

 
Whitney, Henry B. |

Several moralistic diary entries (e.g.,
December 9 and 10, 1864) criticized the
officers’ conduct.

The 110th Regiment participated in the
Siege of Fort Hudson (May 23-July 8, 1863).

On February 28, 1864, the unit arrived
at Fort Jefferson, a federal prison for Con-
federates, in the Dry Tortugas Islands, in
Monroe County, Florida. Various ships brought
supplies, mail,news, and prisoners to Fort
Jefferson. Whitney seems to have stayed there

until his discharge.

 

 
Whitney, Henry B. 4
ere were several favorable references to

— Abraham Lincoln, e.g., April 22,

1 Ss

On July 10, the U.S. Schooner Nonpareil
(not to be confused with the steamer of the
same name) removed from Fort Jefferson all
but four of the Confederate prisoners who
had been there.

On July 20, 1865, Whitney gives the opinion
that Mrs. Mary E. Surratt should have been
given life imprisonment instead of being hanged

The U.S. Navy gunboat Florida arrived on
the 24th with four civilian prisoners convicted

 

 
Whitney, Henry B. 5
of conspiring to assassinate Lincoln: Samuel
Arnold, Dr. Samuel Mudd, Michael O'Laughlin,
and Edward Spangler. According to Whitney,
General Tood, who commanded the prisoners,
and most of the officers were inebriated.

Other Civil War subjects mentioned include
Federal and Confederate prisoners and casualties

 

Louisiana and Florida Negroes; and U.S. Army
camp life, depredations (June 23, 1863),
health conditions, and sickness.

Whitty, James Howard. Papers. 1&2

This collection consists of the letters
and papers of James Howard Whitty, born in
Baltimore, Maryland, 1859-died in Richmond,
Virginia, 1937), author, authority on the life
and work of Edgar Allan Poe, and collector of
the largest Poeana in the world.

 

Whitty began his career in newspaper
work in Beltimore in 1875 and was a member of
the staff of the Richmond Times for five years
For twenty years after that date(1880) he was
employed as secretary and

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch ts).
later Business Manager of the Bradstreet Co.
in Richmond, but shortly after 1900 left this
company to devote his full attention to Boe
research, He was not employed again until
1925 when he took over the Rare Book Section
at Miller & Rhodes Store in Richmond. The
origin of Whitty's interest in Edgar Allen

 

Poe is not revealed in the letters and papers
of this collection, but it seems reasonable to
assume that it stemmed from a boyhood enthus-
iasm for Poe's works. In 1916 he was the

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (4)
organizer and first President of the E.A. P.
Shrine in Richmond, Virginia,and was person-
ally responsible for the preservation and
renovation of Poe's boyhood home there. Un-
fortunately in 1924 a quarrel with the Shrine
directors over finances,,led Whitty to sever
his connection with the Shrine and its activ-
ities, The collection includes a-lotof
correspondence relative to *his.

 

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (5)
During the early 1900's Whitty wrote on
literary and social subjects under the pseud-

nym of "Owen Worth" and in 1911 edited his
first Poe book, which was’ "The Complete Poems
of Edgar Allan Poe." He reedited this volume
in 1917, and edited:"Discoveries in the Uncol
lected Poems Eagar Allan Poe," 1916; "The
Riverside *focket Poems of E.A, Poe," 1920;
"Poe's Foems"(London),: 1921. He acted as com-
piler for "A Record of Virginia Copyright

"The Genius and Character of E. A, Poe," 1929

The earliest items are a photo-capy of
part of the 1790 Census of Richmond and a
photo-copy of a letter concerning the means

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (7)

of precaution and defense which should be
taken by inhabitants of Russel County. Pre-
sumabl& this early material was used by Whitt
in connection with his work on the History of
Richmond, The undated section of the collect-
ion contains numerous drafts and notes of thig
work,

 

Tae bulk of the early material consists of
copies of letters written by Poe and hisrela-
tives and there are copies of letters dated

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch _(8)
1814,1815,1816 from John Randolph of Roanoke
to Ann Morris in which he accuses her of be-
ing a common prostitute and the murderess of
her child and of his brother, Gopies of her
answers to his accusations are also included,
Whitty was interested in writing on John Ran-
dolph of Roanoke, but apparently never did so,

 

Thege are several copies of letters written
by John C, Fremont to Joel Poinsett in 1838
which Whitty apparently used to write an arti

Cle on Fremont which is filed at the end of

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (9)

the end of the folder for 1916, In addition
to the copies of E. A, P. Letters, there is
a document dated February 20, 1889 which is
a statement by a Dr. ‘Moran, who attended Poe
at the time of his death, and a Rev. Clemm
who officiated at his funeral, concerning

 

Poe's death and the circumstances surrounding
it. Whitty's use of this information helped
him in his crusade to clear is the mysteries

and misstatements concerning Foe's death

 
WHITTY, James Howard _Sketch Qo)
which had so injured his reputation.

 

Whitty's correspondence with Poe scholars
all over the world was voluminous for his ef-
forts to uncover new information and to secure
for “oe his rightful place among the Literary

Great were unceasing. There were three corre-
spondents who were outstanding because of the
bulk of their letters, range of years and com
mon concern together with Whitty for the

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch - (11)
truth about Edgar Allan Poe; - George E. Wood
berry, Mary E, “hillips and Thomas Ollive Mab
bott, Whitty and Woodberry became correspond-
ents before 1900 and became personal friends
as early as 1909. Their letters were inter-
changed frequently and their correspondence

 

and friendship continued until Woodberry's
death in 19350. It is obvious from their let-
ters that Woodberry had the greater gift for
writing but Whitty's research and interest

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (12)
were unfailing. Woodberry's interests were
many and varied and he never published any-
thing on Poe after 1909, but this work in two
volumes was and still is used as the stand-
ard authentic version of Poe's life. Most
later books on Poe are elaboration, clarifi-

 

cation and additions to Woodberry's work,

Whitty's correspondence with Mary E,
Phillips of Jamaica Pkain and Boston, Mass.,

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (13)
author of “Poe, The Man," (1926), began in
1914 and continued until Whitty's death in
1937, She was, by far, his most avid corre-
spondent and most earnest admirer. Miss Phil
lips worked unceasingly for 20 years to col-
lect information for her book and she and

Whi tty interchanged their discoveries. In time
Miss *hillips came to look on “hitty as the
ultimate authority on all Poe matters. He
wrote the foreword for her book on Poe and
helped her with corrections and changes. The

 

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (14)
publication of the book was delayed by the ap
pearance of Hervey Allen's "“Israfel" and when
it did appear, did not sell. A Review of the
book is at the end of the 1928 folder. Miss
Phillips got into tremendous debt with her
publishers and was getting old and her eye-
sight failed her at this time, so Whitty took
over the task of getting settlement terms for
her from the publishers. The Sebt was finaly

 

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch ~ (15)
settled in 1953. Miss Phillips apparently
kept all of Whitty's letters to her and in-
tended to give them to the Boston Public/:Lib-
rary, Copley Square, Boston, Mass.

 

Thomas llive Mabbott began to write to
Whitty in 1917 when he was an undergraduate at
Columbia University. In a letter dated March
25, 1918, when he was 19 years old, T.O.M.
describes himself and his interest in Poe,
Mabbott algo looked to Whitty as a great

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (16)
authority and confided his hopes, plans, am-
bitions, love affaris etc. in his letters to
Whitty, Thefr correspondentireveals much a-
bout the ways in which a scholar goes about
uncovering information, as well as reyealing
the pattern of development of T.0.M. from a
somewhat immature, studious youth into a

 

capable, persevering, Poe-enthusiastic schol-

ar. Whitty seems to have been: an unquestioned
able influence in molding Mabbott as a schola

 
WHITTY, James “oward Sketch (17)
but by 1924 the correspondence begins to sug-
gest that T.0.M. was going beyond Whitty in
the scope of his research and study and in
1926 their correspondence ended because Whitt
felt that Mabbott had collaborated with Hervey
Allen and that he (Mabbott) was not giving
Whitty proper recognition for information

 

given him by Whitty. There are frequent ref-
erences in later letters to T.0O.M.'s "planned
campaign of rascality.". Allen also was

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch _(18)
accused of plagarism by Whitty who went so
far as to go to court in England where he won
exclusive copyrights. The crux of the matter
seems to have been that the books and articles
by Allen and Mabbott had more popular appeal
despite minor inaccuracies than the poorly
written, paboriously accurate work of Whitty
and Miss *hillips.

The undated portion of this collection is
large in bulk and contains some letters but

 

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (19)

is mostly rough drafts of Whitty's books and
articles, notes taken and information gather-
ed. A large part of this section contains
material which he collected to draw up a com-
plete Poe Bibliography. This work consumed
the last 10 years of his life but apparently
never was published, Three songs a book of
Ballads by C. Alphonso Smith are alse includ-

ed, The Songs are: "Lenore," "Mrs. *oe,"
"Eldorado."

 

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (20)
There are 614 pictures included with the
undated letters which are valuable for the
range of aspects of Poe's life which they
cover. Probably all the different portraits
of Poe which have been discovered are contain
ed in this section and there are pictures of

 

his foster parents, his wife, Mrs. Clemm and
humberous pictures of the places he lived and
of the Shrines and museums which have been
dedicated to his memory.

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (21)

The clippings included in this collection
consist of what seems to be almost every art-
icle or mention of Poe from 1900-1935. Many
of the articles are in duplicate and many of
them contain notations by Mary E, Phillips
and Whitty, There are also 3 scrapbooks of

 

Clippings. The pamphlets, leaflets, and cir-
Culars are publication notices, advertise-

ments and reviews for books, copies of sect-
ions of books and reprints of Poe's poems and

Stories.

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (22)
This collection is valuabe because of the
picture it affords of the life of a man who
devoted his life to reserch on a single sub-
ject and because it contaiins all of the in-
formation about Poe which was gathered up to
1955. Whitty himself never achieved great-

 

ness as a man, but the work he did is of un-
questionable value to all those who are in-
terested in Edgar Allan Poe, He was more
interested in research than in writing and it

 
WHITTY, James Howard Sketch (25)
is to that field that he made the greatest
contribution,

Among the many correspondents are: Hervey
Allen, Philip Alexander Bruce, William Cabell
Bruce, Killis Campbell, Lewis Chase, Thomas
Ollive Mabbott, C. Alphonso Smith, George
E, Woodberry, Edwin Markham, William E. Dodd
and others too numerous to enumerate,

Louis Tresevant Wigfall (1816-1874) was born
and educated in South Carolina. In 1848 he
moved to Texas where he was elected to the
state senate and then to the U. S. Senate. He
urged secession and became a brigadier general

in the C.S.A- Army. He resigned his commission,
however, to take a seat: in the Confederate
Senate in 1862. He clashed with Jefferson Davis

over the management of the war and became the
leader of the Congressional opposition to Davis

 
Wigfall, Louis Tresevant 2

 

He escaped to England in 1865, returning in
1872 and settling in Galveston shortly before
nis death.

On January 16, 1862, John Bell Hood wrote to
Wigfall concerning uniforms for the Texas
troops. Hood also urged that the method of
selecting company officers be changed from
election to appointment.

Wightman, Joseph Milner. Papers. Boston,
Suffolk County, Massachusetts

 

This collection consists of ninety-three let-
ters written to Wightman, Philosophical Instru-
ment Maker, of Boston. Also included are a
clipping attached to a letter dated Nov. 1l,
1850, with a short sketch and picture of South

Boston Methodist Episcopal Church and a 4 x 6
inch fragment of paper. The fragment contains
a picture of two buildings and people in the
street (four on horseback). The picture may

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner
have originally been printed on stationery.
While Wightman was unlisted in several Mas-
sachusetts biographical works, a search of sev-
eral Boston city directories was revealing. In
the 1850-1851 directory, Wightman was listed as
the maker of "philosophical and electromagnetic
instruments." In the 1857 directory, he was

 

listed as making German chemical apparatus in
addition to his responsibilities as a philo-
sophical instrument manufacturer. The Boston
city directory of 1862 listed Wightman as mayor

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner 2
with a salary of $4000. By the 1870 directory,
however, he was not listed as an official in the
Boston government. It is indicated in two let-
ters that Wightman was active in local civic
affairs before he became mayor. He was the
author of several works. Besides several edi-
tions of his Catalogue of Philosophical, Astro-

 

 

nomical, Chemical and Electrical Apparatus he
also published works on the air pump and elec-
tricity.

Most of the collection's letters date from

 

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner 4
the 1840's and early 1850's and concern the or-
dering of scientific apparatus for universities,
colleges and academies. In some cases, corre-
spondents sent Wightman equipment to be repaired
or asked Wightman to trade equipment he had for
something they had. No less than twenty-eight
institutions of higher learning and twenty-
three academies are represented in this col-
lection. The schools were located throughout
the eastern United States and as far west as
Illinois and Texas. Schools in Canada and one

 

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner 5
in Cuba are also included. Three of the schools
are illustrated on letterhead stationery. Two
are illustrated on circulars that also include
information about the schools' curriculum, fac-
ulty and tuition.

Several letters contain scientific drawings.
In some instances a detailed description of the
kind of instrument desired and how it should
work were given. Such descriptions were given
for air-pumps, batteries and pulleys. In one
letter, the brazing and soft soldering processes

 

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner 6
were compared and the soft soldering process
railed against. Among the scientific apparatus
requested were magic lanterns (projectors),
glass flasks and sliders (slides). Sliders of
several types were ordered including those of
the aurora borealis, fire works and descriptive
astronomy. One of the surprising requests was

 

for a piano. The writer requested "one of good
tone but plain exterior." Models of the eye,
ear and the steam engine were ordered. Charles
Phillips, from the University of North Carolina
stated how important he thought scientific

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner 7

 

models were. "Models are of the highest impor-
tance. They excite curiosity more powerfully
then the best and largest drawings and they
best satisfy what they excite."

It is obvious from the complimentary tone of
many Of these letters, that Wightman enjoyed a
good reputation as a "philosophical instrument
maker." Several of the writers left it to
Wightman's discretion to include in their order
what supplies that he thought they might need.
Such sentiments as those made by C. P. Jones,

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner 8

 

of Genesee and Wyoming Seminary in New York,
were not unusual. "Do as well by us as you can
afford . . . I have not time to make a list of
chemicals . . . Please include everything in
this line which I shall need with the apparatus
ordered."

It is clear from the concerns expressed by

Wightman's customers that they were extremely
fortunate to receive supplies well packed, in
good order, and unbroken. S. H. Douglass writ-
ing from the University of Michigan in Ann

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner 9
Arbor states, "I am sorry to say I have sometimes
received articles from you not as well packed as
they should have been." It is not surprising
how goods could have been damaged considering
the circuitous route some of them had to travel.
John Le Conte, at the time professor of physics
and chemistry at Franklin College in Athens,

 

Georgia, wrote regarding his order. He said,
"Send them by the first packet to Savannah.
Direct to me Franklin College, Athens, Georgia,
care of W. P. Williams, Agent of Steamer Boat

 
Wightman, Joseph .Milner 10
Company, Savannah. Please have them packed very
carefully, as they have to come one hundred and
twenty miles by railroad. Also have them in-
sured." In several letters either the corre-
spondent or an acquaintance of theirs would be
in Boston and would stop by in person to view
Wightman's equipment and bring back needed sup-

 

plies. ;

Delays in the shipment of goods it seems were
common. Such was the concern expressed by B. E.
Perry, Principal of Chester Academy, in Chester,

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner 11
Vermont. He wrote, "I sent you more that two
weeks since a box of apparatus to be repaired
and a little order to be filled out... We
are in great need of those articles .. . Our
term is hastening away and our lectures are be-
ing delayed."

Several correspondents used Davis's catalog

 

or manual to order supplies. Apparently Wight-
man carried a variety of equipment made by

Davis. The way the requested items were writ-
ten varied from person to person. Some listed

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner 12
each item separately and neatly in a column with
the price beside it. Others requested the items
in paragraph form making it more difficult to
read.

Several schools were operating on tight equip
ment budgets and would tell Wightman how much
money they had to spend. Several letters dealt

 

with what terms the school preferred to use in
paying its bill. Ezra Slocum Carr, writing from
Castleton Medical College in Castleton, Vermont
said, "We would prefer, as the bills of the

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner aa
college are paid at the close of the spring ses-
sion (20 June), to not pay for it until that
time. If it is necessary, however, it can be
done before. I refer you Dr. Laurnel Parkman
connected with the hospital in your city."
Medical education was discussed by Henry Tut-
wiler, who was planning to "commence" a high
school in Green Springs, Alabama in 1847. He
said he wanted to have a "laboratory for the
purpose of giving instruction in chemistry to
such young men as are engaged in the study of

 

 
Wightman, Joseph Milner 14

 

medicine preparatory to their attendance on a
course Of lectures in the med schools. It is
* e« e« a universal complaint that unless a young
man knows something of this science before he
attends 'the lectures,' he leaves it as ignor-
ant as he went."

There were two letters from Lewis Feuchtwan-

ger, chemist and importer, who was one of
Wightman's suppliers. On a letterhead, Feuch-
twanger was listed as an importer of chemicals,
drugs, metals and materials for the daguerro-

Wilberforce, Samuel. Papers,1790-1872. Oxford.
and Winchester, England. Sketch.

This collection relates to Samuel Wilber-
force (1805-1873), successively Bishop of
Oxford and Winchester. He was the son of William
Wilberforce of antislavery fame. llost of the
items in this collection are letters to Samuel

 

Wilberforce when he was Bishop of Oxford, and
they relate primarily to missionary activities
of the Church of England in East Africa and
various British colonies,

East Africa is the subject of a number of

 
Wilberforce, Samuel, 2
detailed letters to Wilberforce from 1853 to
1863. There are two items from John William
Colenso, Bishop of Natal. Colenso discusses the
status of the Anglican Church in Natal, his
attempts to acquire financial aid, the refusal
of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel
to provide such aid for white residents,
difficulties between the Governor of Natal and
his council, and injustices to the Kaffirs.

An incomplete letter (1853?) apparently refers
to Colenso's appointment as bishop. In a
seventeen-page letter of Aug. 23, 1860, Chris-
topher Palmer Rigby, a veteran British army

 

 
Wilberforce, Samuel. 3
officer, discusses economic and social conditions
in Zanzibar, the extent of the slave trade there
during the preceding year, and French activities
on the island. He also writes about the depop-
ulation of the adjacent African coast by slaving
expeditions, British naval actions against
Slavers, and recent ventures into the interior.

 

There are ten letters (Nov. 1859-Dec., 1861)
from Charles Frederick.Mackenzie, Bishop of
Central Africa. Bishop Mackenzie reached East
Africa in 1861 and with the aid of David
Livingstone established a mission in the Shire

 
Wilberforce, Samuel. 4

(or Shiré) River region that is now in southern
Nyasaland. Five of these items (Nov. 8, 1859-
Sept. 4, 1860) concern Mackenzie's preparations
for his African work and his travels in England
on behalf of missions. From Capetown, South
Africa, the bishop discusses his consecration,
plans for the mission, and preparations to meet

 

Livingstone who has offered his assistance. On
Feb. 27, 1861, he describes at length his dis-
cussions with Livingstone about the selection of
a site for the mission. There are two letters
from Mackenzie in Nyasaland. In a letter (21 ppJ

 
Wilberforce, Samuel, 5

of July 17-Nov. 1, 1861, he describes the march
from the Shire River into the nearby region
where the mission was established. During this
journey Livingstone and Sir John Kirk freed

many Slaves who were being transported to marketq
The bishop debates the question of how far he
Should go in the defence of Africans under his

 

charge from the depredation of slavers and other
tribes. On Dec. 14, 1861, Mackenzie writes (4 pp
about his defence of the Manganja from the
warring Ajawa tribesmen and states his hope to
repair relations with the Ajawa.

 
Wilberforce, Samuel, 6
Letters from several other sources contain
detailed information on the first British ex-
peditions and missions in the basin of the
Zambezi River. There are contemporary copies of
several letters of David Livingstone. On March
3, 1859, he writes from Tete, Mozambique, about
his aseent of the Zambezi to that interior post.

 

Livingstone was then conducting an expedition
into the Zambezi region under the auspices of
the British government. On March 15, 1862, he
writes about Mackenzie's destruction of a
hostile village, and he relates the events which

 
 

Wilberforce, Samuel. Z
lead to the death of the bishop in January,1862,
In 1866 (May 7) Livingstone states his opinion
that the Shire country is the best and most
strategic location for missions, and he also
notes the displeasure of the local Portuguese
toward their government's allowance of British
activity in Mozambique (42 pp.). In a long

letter of Apr. 27, 1862, a member of Livingstonds
expedition relates a good account of the Shire
region,the condition of the African population,
the decision of Mackenzie to fight the Ajawa and
the circumstances of that decision, the faults
of Magomero as a site — the mission, and the

 
Wilberforce, Samuel. 8

 

conditions of health in the region. On Feb. 2,
1863, Lord John Russell, Foreign Secretary,
informs Wilberforce of the decision to withdraw
Livingstone's expedition, and Wilberforce then
asks (“pi:4) how much help the missions can
expect trom the British navy thereafter.

Anglican etivity in Sarawak, Tasmania, New
Zealand, and the West Indies is the subject of
several items of 1857-1864. Henry Labouchere,
Colonial Secretary, comments on the continual
lack of good clergymen’ in the West Indies (Nov.
1, 1857). He also discusses arrangements for

 
Wilberforce, Samuel. 9

 

three new bishoprics in New Zealand and the
problem of altering the patent of Bishop George
Augustus Selwyn (July 8, 18, 1857). A letter
from central Tasmania has comment on the weak
condition of the church there (Nov. 21, 1860).
On Uct. 11, 1864, Walter Chambers, later Bishop
of Singapore, Labuan, and Sarawak, gives a long
description of mission work in Sarawak,

Two letters (Apr. 23, 1832, and Feb. 11,
1833) to Wilberforce relate to his attempts to
unite the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel with.the Church Missionary Society. An

 
Wilberforce, Samuel. 10

 

unidentified letter of Dec. 3, 1790 (signed,
"T.T.") relates to activity in Parliament for
the suppression of the slave trade,

Two items have information on British sub-
jects who held high authority in Egypt and
Sarawak. In a memorandum of Apr. 2, 1860 (13 pp.
enclosed in A, L. S. of Dec. 30, 1864) Sir

James Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak, discusses his
foreign policy toward England. Sir Charles
Johnson Brooke, the rajah's son and successor,
was the exercizing executive authority in
Sarawak. On Oct. 24, 1869, Sir Samuel White

Wilberforce, Samuel. ya

 

Baker. discusses his expedition on the White
Nile to check the slave.trade. This expedition
was under the authority of the Egyptian govern-
ment. He details plans to halt the slave trade,
outlines his plans for a parental government in
the Sudan, and lists his forces.

Two notes of Samuel Wilberforce (July 13,

1848, and Oct. 6, 1851) were transferred from
the William Wilberforce MSS.

Unpublished letters of William Wilberforce
(1759-1833) - philanthropist, member of the
House of Commons after 1780, and leader of the
movement in England for the abolition of the
Slave trade - written to Thomas Harrison, a
close friend and a member of the Duke of Glou-

cester's West India Committee. The content of
the letters relates almost entirely to business
matters and events involved in Wilberforce's
campaign against the slave trade; a campaign

in which Thomas Harrison seems to have served

 
Wilberforce _2
as one of Wilberforce's valuable assistants.

Other prominent leaders of the movement, whose
names occur throughout the letters, were James
Stephen, Zachary Macaulay, and Thomas Clarkson.
In addition, in his letter of Aug. 11, 1817,

Wilberforce praised the Duke of Gloucester for

 

his many services,

Approximately one-half of the letters in
the collection were written by Wilberforce in
1814 or 1815. Most of the more interesting
of the letters will be found in this group. In
one letter of Aug. 10,1814, Wilberforce wrote

 
Wilberforce 3
Harrison that he had been able to persuade
Thomas Clarkson not to attend the Congress of
Vienna. Perhaps, wrote Wilberforce, Clarkson
might be able to further the cause of the
abolitionists; but if he failed, the blame
would be on his ¢Clarkson's; shoulders, and no

 

Castlereagh's. Articles appeared in The Edin-
burgh Review during 1814 which questioned
William Pitt's motives in supporting the
abolitionists. Wilberforce (Oct. 22, 1814)
wréte Harrison concerning his relations with

the younger Pitt (d. i and stated that

 
Wilberforce 4
his belief was that Pitt had been a "sincere
friend" of the abolition movement. Other let-
ters for 1814 mention such things as the West
India Committee and its membership, including
the Duke of Gloucester, Lord Grey, Marquis
Lansdowne, and Lord Grenville (Mar. 20 & Apr. 20

 

and the planned composition and distribution

of pamphlets describing the evils of the slave
trade and advocating its abolition (Apr. 26 &
Oct. 3). The letter of Apr. 26 suggests the
establishment of a special board, sanctioned by
the King, to see to oe” of such

 
Wilberforce 5

works,
Wilberforce was in touch with men in high
government positions in England. In 1815, he
Vers permission to interview Lord Bathhurst
letter of May 23, 1815); and Lord Liverpool
took Wilberforce into confidence and informed

 

him when the Portuguese consented to abolish
the slave trade north of the line (letter of
Feb. 11, 1815). That Wilberforce took care to
ascertain the views of prominent government
officials and members of Parliament regarding
the abolition issue rT i seen in his letter

 
Wilberforce 6
to Harrison of Dec. 14, 1815, in which he ex-
pressed his desire that Zachary Macaulay, Henry
Brougham and others speak to their political
friends, and that the Duke of Gloucester sound
out Lords Grenville, Lansdowne, and Holland.

The problem at hand at this time was whether

 

or not the general principle of abolition
could be enforced. Wilberforce was then of
the opinion that it could not.

There are a few interesting bits of in-
formation in the letters after 1815. In 1817,

Wilberforce was —) by the hostile pamph-

 
Wilberforce 7
lets of one of his opponents, Joseph Marryatt.
Wilberforce wrote to Harrison concerning this
matter on Aug. 4, 1817, and discussed the
urgency of having one of James Stephen's
speeches in answer to Marryatt printed and
distributed as soon as possible. Wilberforce

 

recognized the need for much printed material
to educate the peoples of all countries, and
especially the "unprincipled Frenchmen" "(lette
of Aug. 5, 1821), in support of abolition of
the slave trade. In this connection, Wilber-
force was excited over the use that could be

 
Wilberforce, William 8

 

made of the information regarding Slave ships
provided by Sir George Collier (letter of Aug.
15, 1821).

The collection contains five undated letters.

95 items added 5-15-56, The majority of the
se letters-are written by Wilberforce to fis

close friend John Scandrett Harford, Jr.

ions which favor abolition and mentions Chat dé

and, Humboldt, and Madame de Stal. It also

tells of the Duke of Wellington, the King of
France (Louis XVIII), Prince Talleyrand, and the
English Prince Regent (later George IV) as bei
favorable to abolition, A letter ¢ Nov. 23, 18%
continues to speak of abolition in the light of
world events, and Wellington and Talleyrand's

correspondence with him, .One fragment of a
strong letter,’ dated 1816, gives a graphic ac-
count of two slave ships. This letter also asks
Harford to try to interest the Roman Catholic
Church in banning the slave trade, Wilberforce

 
Wilberforce, William 10
also mentions trying to interest Sir Thomas Ac-
land and Lord Castlereagh in making an attempt
to interest the Pope in the abolition of the
Slave trade.

The other letters speak of many things, some
are fairly personal, giving advice and reminisc-
ing; some tell of his family and friends,

 

A May 15 ,1812?5 letter speaks of Dr. Samuel
Johnson, A Sept. 8, 1812,letter asks Harford
(during his bridal tour of Ireland) to try to
ascertain the comparative moral effects of the-
Catholic and Protestant religions on the peasant

 
Wilberforce, William 11
and servant classes of Ireland. A Feb. 7, 182%
letter from Chas, Forster to Harford tells of
the efforts of the Church of England clergy to
convert the Roman Catholics in Ireland,

These letters often mention charities, espec-
ially the Bible Society. A May 2, 1821, letter
speaks of investigating and learning about col-
leges. Wilberforce speaks of the "experiment!
in education being conducted by Harford, This
is leading up to Harford's giving land and help-
ing found St. David's College in South Wales in
1822, A Nov, 9, 1827, letter speaks of St. David

Attached to a letter of Oct. 16 ¢181973 is an
interesting pamphlet which gives the pertinent
facts about the "House of Protection for the
Maintenance and Instruction of Girls of good
character, "

A July 9, 1816, letter speaks of Zachary Mac-—
aulay; and a May 7, 1817, letter tells of a Mac-
aulay letter falling into the hands of the
pamphleteer Joseph Marryatt. Wilberforce also
speaks bitterly of Marryatt's attack on himself.

Mrs, Harford is a daughter of Richard Hart

 

 
Wilberforce, William

 

Davis, and sister of Hart Davis.

An August 10, 1819,letter speaks of Richard
Hart Davis' going to Mauritius Island in an of-
ficial capacity.

An April 14, 1819, letter tells of Wilber-
force's failing eyesight andhis need to employ
a reader and a secretary. Almost every letter

after this date mentions his poor eyesight and
his failing health. As a consequence of his
wretched health, Wilberforce sends a letter of
resignation to Parliament, Mrs.Wilberforce wri
es (Feb. 5, 1825) to Mrs, Harford telling of

 
Wilberforce, William 14
this, and asking her not to mention the resign-
ation until it is official. She also mentions
telling Hannah More.

Hannah More is often spoken of in these let-
ters, as she was the friend of both the Wilber-
force and Harford families. A Sept. 11, 1821,
letter speaks of her illress and of the encour-

 

aging letters she continually receives from the
United States, Letters of Aug. 10, 1819; Sept.
4, 1819; Dec. 5, 1825; Oct. 18, 1828; Nov. 15,
1828; andAug. 35, 1829,mention Hannah More in re-
ference to proposed visits in her home. An Oct.

 
Wilberforce, William 15

 

15, 1836, letter mentions her in connection with
an anti-slavery meeting. A Mar. 26, 1832,letter
tells of sending her the account of the death of
her god-daughter, Elizabeth (Wilberforce) James.

A Mar. 29, 1833,letter from Clara cDiceyy
Clarke speaks of Hannah More. An Avril 2, 1833,
letter speaks of Hannah More as being in a pit-
iable condition, ;

A Sept. 6, 1831, letter reminieces about the
Dean of Carlisle and speaks of an Alexander
Knox letter he wants,

Wilberforce very often gives news of his
children, especially after 1820. He was very
proud of Samuel, who later became Bishop of Ox-
ford and of Winchester; Henry William, who later

 

became a Roman Catholic journalist and author;
and Robert Isaac, who became Archdeacon of West
Riding. In letters of Feb. 21, 1832, and Mar. 26
1852,Wilberforce tells of Robert Isaac's engage-
ment to Agnes Everilda, the daughter of Francis

and Elizabeth, died before he did,

Touching letters of Feb. 24, 1831, Mar. 25,
18351, and Sept. 6, 1831, tell of Wilberforce's
son, William, losing so much of his father's
money through a dairy farm, that Wilberforce had
to economize in order to keep up his children's
heavy allowances, Wilberforce rented his home
and let most of his servants go, only keeping a
"man and maid and reader." He spent his last
few years in "taking the waters" at Bath, and
in visiting his children and his friends, His

The Dictionary of National Biography
states that John Scandrett Harford, Jr. used
his recollections and Wilberforce's letters to
write his reminiscences of William Wilberforce,

severe penal code, and the argues that capital
punishment should be rarely used.

On Oct. 30, 1817, Sir James Mackintosh,
philosopher, eulogizes Wilberforce's effort
against the slavet rade. He attributes his
failure to speak on this subject recently in
the House of Commons to the attack of a ady
which has bothered him since hisreturn from
India. This illness affects him mentally.
Also included are notes from Sir Humphry Davy

which Wilberforce criticizes the preaching of
William Jay, a prominent dissenting clergy-

 

man. On Aug. 5, 1813, Wilberforce compliments
William Frederick, Second Duke of Gldtester and
Edinburgh, on his activity as president of the
African Insititution. In a letter of Apr. 13,

403 items added, 8-11-66. Most of these
letters were addressed to Wilberforce, and the
correspondents are numerous, Among the letters
are series from Hannah More, William Pitt,
Lord Brougham, Spencer Perceval, Thomas
Chalmers, George Canning, and John Bowdler
(ad. 1815). All correspondents are listed in
the Autograph File.

The letters are so numerous, rich, and
varied in content that a prose description of
them is unsuitable. Therefore, a selective

index of topics and persons has been compiled.
It occasionally includes addressees. This
index does not include the manuscripts
cataloged before 1966. (Index in Iventory File.)
Most of the letters were formerly bound
in two volumes, one of which was arranged
chronologically and the other alphabetically.
In both volumes the letters were not in
complete order, and there were many undated
items. There were apparently one or more
other volumes,. for loose manuscripts in this

accession and in earlier ones still were
mounted on the paper used for binding. The
difficulty of reference, cataloging, and
photoduplication of the manuscripts resulted
in their removal from the volumes and their
inclusion with the other manuscripts in
chronological sequence.

The compiler of the volumes is uncertain.
A note on the last page of the Duchess of
Gordon's letter of July 13, 1788, suggests
that one of Wilberforce's sons put the volumes

 
Wilberforce, William ae
together. The cover of one of the volumes
had a book plate of Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop
of Oxford, the third son of William and one of
his biographers. This cover is filed at the
end of the undated letters.

Numerous letters have been published, but
often incompletely and sometimes inaccurately.

 

Many of them, however, probably are unpublished

of Wilberforce's letter of Jan. 4, 1822, to
Joseph Wilson of Stowlangtoft Hall. On Jan. 5,
1827, Wilberforce wrote to Wilson about the
needy case of the Rev. A. M. Simkin and noted
his own diminution of income.

Robert Isaac Wilberforce's letter of Oct. 17,
1835, to Henry Wilson, M. P., concerned person-
al and family matters. Wilson was the son of
Joseph Wilson.

1 item added, 9-23-81: On Aug. 31, 1814,
John Cartwright wrote about: a series of let-
ters to Thomas Clarkson; the strong backing of

necessary to support the cause of Africa at the
Congress of Vienna; the attitude of Czar Alex-
ander of Russia towards the slave trade and
plans to communicate with him and with the
Bishop of Blois, Henri Grégoire; the need to
abolish a traffic afflicting the English nation
that is worse than the African slave trade; the
connection between the causes of African free-
dom and English freedom; and England's role of
leadership in the cause of freedom.  Cartwright'
remarks about the situation in England

 

 
Wilberforce, William 31
apparently relate to the theme of his Letters to
Clarkson on African and English Freedom (1814)
in which he argued that deprivation of full

political rights was the most serious problem in
the country.

Wilberfoss, England. Poor Law Accounts,
1799-1829. Wilberfoss, Yorkshire, England.

 

This volume contains the financial accounts
for the administration of the poor laws in the
township of Wilberfoss,in the East Riding of
Yorkshire, England, from 1799-1829. The ac-

counts are of two types--the disbursements by
the overseers of the poor and the assessments
against those citizens who were taxed for poor
relief. The overseer's accounts are usually

recorded on a semiannual basis, and they extend

 
Wilberfoss, England ee

with few interruptions from April, 1799, to
April, 1828. The date, amount, and purpose of
each expenditure is noted, and the names of
recipients of relief are included. Various
persons served as overseers. The assessments,
usually annual, are similarly detailed, the
names, valuation and payments of each taxpayer

 

being recorded. Assessment accounts date from
April, 1800, to April, 1829. ©

This volume once belonged to Gerald Robert
Owst, Professor of Education in the University
of CaMbridge. His note on the history of the

 
Wilberfoss, England
volume appears at its front. Also included
here are a letter and obituaries of John Bell
(d. 1939), 2 millowner and prominent citizen
of WilberfosSs. Bell, a former overseer for the
parish, gave this volume to Gerald Owst, whose
family once resided at Wilberfoss.

contains comments on the severe economic
conditions of 1799.

Aaron Wilbur, a business man of Savannah,
Georgia, (born December 12, 1821 and died Dec.
5, 1869) was the son of Ezra Wilbur (1791-1825)
and Elizabeth Richardson Wilbur, The Wilbur
family came to New England in the seventeenth
céntury, and Aaron Wilbur was born in Windsor

 

County, Vermont. He was twice married there and
had three children by his second Marriage. On
Feb, 7, 1855, he married Mary Eunice Copp (b.
Jan. 29, 1833) in Savannah, She was the daugh-
ter of Daniel Dennison Copp and Eunice (Waldo)

 
WILBUR, Aaron -2- Sketch
Copp. There were five children of this marriage
Henry Martyn, Mary Aronetta, Fedora Isabel, Min
nie Lulu and Sallie Eunice,

Prior to the Civil War Wilbur was in the in-
surance business in Savannah, representing the
Charter Oak Company of Hartford, Connecticut,
With the coming of the war this business was cut
off. Wilbur then undertook to buy cotton for
the government of Georgia, in connection with
the Western and Atlantic Railroad, and subsi-
dized by the insurance company. For a time he

apparently operated a store which sold goods ru

 

 
WILBUR, Aaron -3- Sketch

in thpough the blockade, The papers are too in-
complete to make a very accurate story of the
complicated transactions which took place during
the war years,

In any case, Wilbur had tn his possession
several hundred bales of cotton when Sherman en-
tered Savannah in December, 1864, Just what
had been Wilbur's attitude toward the War is un-
certain, but it seems likely that he was a Unia
ist throughout, It is impossible to say which
side he intended to aid by his business transac-

tions. In any case he set out to prove that he

 

 
WILBER, Aaron -4- Sketch
had always been a Unionist in order to collect
on the cotton in his hands when Sherman arrived.
This involved expensive litigation lasting at
least until 1907 if not later. The papers do
not conclusively reveal the results but indicate
that about 1900 the daughter, Fedora I. Wilbur,
took up the case and ultimately was paid about
$58,000.

There was also some difficulty in connection
with the insurance company for which Wilbur had
worked before the War. After his death in 1869

his widow tried to collect commissions which wee

 

 
WILBUR, Aaron -5- Sketch
@iis Him when he died. The insurance company, on
the other hand, argued that he owed them large
sums in premiums which he had collected between
1861 and 1865 but had never turned in. The out-
come of this litigation &8 not indicated in the
Papers. There are a few letters, chiefly on fi-
nancial matters, written by Alexis McNulty, prod
ably a half-brother of Mrs. Wilbur,

 

The collection consists of 47 ofiginal lettes

was the youngest daughter of Marius Hartwell
and Sarah (Pratt) Wheeler. Over the course of
her career, she had more than twenty volumes
published, mostly books of poetry. Throughout
her lifetime, she enjoyed great popularity.

While critics spoke of platitudes and senti-
mentality in her work, she maintained that her
poetry helped comfort millions of unhappy and

weary people,

three poems written by "Miss M. A. Andrews."
The card appears on the verso of a page that

whole page appears to have been part of a

Hoyt quite possibly was Charles Hale Hoyt,
dramatist. In a fragment of a letter dated
Jan. 1893, Ms, Wilcox said she and James Whit-
comb Riley were never engaged. Ms. Wilcox and
Riley did meet once and corresponded with each

 

other several times. (From The Maturity of
James Whitcomb Riley, (1922) by Marcus Dickey,
pgs. 112-115). In a letter dated 1900, she
said she would continue having her books pub-

Nilde was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1789
and died in New Orleans in 1847. The family
moved to Georgia in his youth, and there

he studied law and was admitted to the bar
in 1809. From 1815 to 1817 and again from
1827 to 1835 he served in Congress where
he took a definite stand against the

Force bill, the tariff, and against the

 
Wilde, A. H. 2

removal of currency from the U. §. bank.

From 1835 to 1840 he lived in Europe, de-
voting himself to scholarly pursuits, and
especially to a study of Dante and Tasso.

In 1842 he agéan entered Georgia politics

and attended the Whig convention at Milledge-

 

ville. In 1843 he became professor of lew
at Louisiana University. Wilde's best known
work is The Lament of the Captive. His work
on Dante and Tasso are scholarly, and his

translations of Italian, Spanish, and French

poems are good. Ss

by Wilde. The Oxford Companion to American
Literature (3rd ed., 1956), says on p. 830,
"His lyric poems are uncollected; an incomplete
life of Dante and translations of Italian
poets are unprinted." The D. A. Be, XX, 207,
says that Wilde “commenced ‘The Life and Times
of Dante*® and 'The Italian Lyric Poets.* (The

 

 
Wilde, ichard Henry =a 6
unfinished manuscripts are in the Library of
Congress. )"

The first three poems in the volume, on p. l,
were translated by Wilde from the Italian of
Bertoli in 1821. "Beauteous and Sincere Thou
Art," "On an Old Coquet," and "On a Lackey, Lazy
and Gluttonous."

 

On the third page of the volume is Wilde's
poem, “Down Sits the Sun," dated July 28, 1830,
with a headnote.

Pp. 4 and 5 contain his "What Leaves Are
These," dated Aug. 1, 1831.

 
Wilde, Richard Henry 7

Wilde's "Give Me a Subject” is on pp. 6-7.
Date: May, 1831.

On pp. 8-11 is Wilde's poem of Aug. 13, 1830,
called "Augustus Tomlinson's Farewell to London.
Paraphrased from *Paul Clifford." " Bulwer-
Lytton’s novel, Paul Clifford, was first pub-
lished in the same year.

On p.- 1l and dated April 5, 1832 is Wilde's
poem, entitled "Paraphrase of a Figure in the
lst Volume of Eugene Aram." Eugene Aram (1832)
is another Bulwer-Lytton novel.

"I Write!" is another Wilde poem. Pp. 12-13,

Wilde's "The Age of Reptiles," pp. 16-17
(with a fractional sheet attached), dated May
12, 1832[?], seems to have been inspired by
Sir Charles Lyell's geological researches.

The footnote refers to the Edinburgh, Scotland,
New Philosophical Yournal; and to the 21st no.
of Silliman's Journal, containing "The Geologica

May Talk" is on pp. 19-20, followed on pp. 21-
22 by Wilde's parody of it, "You May Talk of You

Ppp. 23-24. Undated. On p. 25 is Wilde's

Scrapbook, 1819-1929. Sketch.

 

This collection consists mainly of personal
letters by famous and once famous Britishers, as
well as Americans, French, Germans, and others.
There are letters by royalty, nobility, states-
men, generals, clergymen, authors, composers,

scientists, engineers, et al.

While most of the letters in this collectior
have little or no value for research, two of
them are worthy of comment. In a letter of July
10, 1845, Thomas Clarkson states that Baron
Metcalfe, Provisional eo of Canada,

 
Wilder, Henry Arthur John 2

 

will assist all fugitive slaves who escape to
that country from the U. S. CGlarkson argues
against the flogging of British seamen and the
operation of the crimping houses. He mentions
Thomas Hamilton, Ninth Earl of Haddington, First
Lord of the Admiralty; and Sir Robert Peel, Jr.,

Prime Minister.

On April 28, 1859, Prince Albert writes to
General Jonathan Peel about Army and Navy
Ordnance.

Sketch

 

Calvin Henderson Wiley(Feb.3,1819-
Jan.11,1887),fbrst superintendent of common
school in N.C.,was born in Guilford county,

N.C.,the son of David L. and Anne(Wood-
burn)Wiley.Prepared at Caldwell Institute,
he entered the University of N.C.,from
which he graduated in 1840. He studied law

was admitted to the bar,and settled in Oxford,

 
WILEY,Calvin Henderson __Sketch(2)

N.C..The backward political and economic
conditions in N.C. aroused Wiley's interest
in education. Gaining a seat in the legisla-
ture(1850-1852), he secured Legal permission
for a superintendent of common schools to

be chosen by the legislature and td hold

 

office for two years. Wiley was.chosen for
this position and held it until 1865. During
his thirteen years of service he labored for
complete reorganization and improvement in
education-He wrote articles,edited the N.C.

 
WILEY,Caltin Henderson __Sketch(3)

Journal of Education (originally Common
School Journal),and aroused interest in the
Cause of popular education. His services
were recognized and other states sought to
cepy his educational plan. In cooperation
with Braxton Craven,he helped promote Normal

 

 

College,the first teacher training institu-
tion of semi-public character in the state.
The schools continued to operate even during
the war and through Wiley's influence the
permanent public school endowment was left

 
WILEY ,Calvin Henderson Sketch(4)
untouched. for military purposes.

A deeply religious man,Wiley sought
to apply to education the ideas of Christian
faith.In later years he was associated with
the American Bible Society. Settling in
Winston,N.C?,he assisted in the establishment

 

of a graded school system there. In 1855 he
was licensed by the Presbyterian Church to
preach,but never had a regular charge. On
Feb.25,1862 he mgrried Mittie Towles of
Raleigh,by whom he had seven children.

 
WILEY,Calvin Henderson Sketch(5

The collection cong§ains three pieces:
(1) a questionnair relative to the public
school system in N.C.; (2) a prospectus of
the N.C? Presbyterianj;and (3) an agreement
that Wiley made to furnish nitre to the
Confederate government. The prominince of
the man rather’ than the intrinsic value
of the papers makes the collection interest-

ing.

There are a few unimportant Civil War let-
ters. Fort Fisher (N. C.) is mentioned in Con-
federate soldiers’ letters.

Many of the post-Reconstruction letters

(1881-1901) are by Duncan McMillan (1832-
1901), a North Carolinian who settled in
Quincy, Fla. He served as a capt. in the 15th
Regt. of Confederate Cav. and later joined the
United Confederate Veterans. He was a member

 
Wilkerson, Archibald

of the Fla. Legislature during part of the Civil]
War and just after it. He married Miss Isabel-
la Love, but there is little mention of her and
they appear to have had no children. McMillan
appears to have been a Presbyterian. From

1886 to 1898 he was a bookCkeeper in the A. L.
Wilson Store. A faithful Democrat, he was
several times elected treasurer of Gadsden
County. See letters of June 13, 1891, and July
27, 1899, for information about his family his-
tory. His obituary is attached to a letter of

Apr. 25, 1901.

 

 
Wilkerson, Archibald 4

 

McMillan has much to say about preachers,
religion, social life, and politics in his
adopted state of Fla. The town of Milton, he
declares, was nearly depopulated by yellow feve
ca. 1852-1853. There was a large tobacco in-
dustry in Quincy, where White Owl cigars were
manufactured. Politicians discussed include

Col. R. H. M. Davidson, a former U. S.
Representative from Fla.; and. .E. V. McCaskill,
a former Fla. legislator. Acquainted as he
was with courtchouse news, it is hardly sur-
prising that McMillan's letters sometimes dis-

 
Wilkerson, Archibald 5

 

cuss crimes, including murders and lynchings
by both blacks and whites.

A letter of Feb. 23, 1888, mentions that
Pres. and Mrs. Cleveland were expected in Fla.
the previous day. On Dec. 14, 1889, reference
is made in a letter from Quincy, Fla., about

a memorial service.

Miss. tornadoes are discussed on Jan. 31
and May 10, 1893, and Feb. 21, 1894.

Crime in Miss. and travel in the U. S. are

discussed.

 
Wilkerson, Archibald r
The twentieth century correspondence is most
ly by North Carolinians, including the McLeans.
Autograph cards have been prepared for Jo-
sephus Daniels, H. L. Godwin, Q. K. Nimocks,
sre, and J. G. Shaw. Subjects discussed by
these men include N. C. politics from 1914-1920
The legal papers (1779-1918) contain N. C.
land grants by Govs. Richard Caswell and
Alexander Martin; and N. C. land deeds. Samuel
Brown's will is dated Jan. 26, 1804. Attached
to Brown's will is an inventory of his estate.
A Robeson County (N. C.) court order designates

James K,, son of Alexander H. and Mary Ann
Wilkerson of Granville County, joined Company K,
55 North Carolina Regiment in August, 1861,
and served until the close of the war. The
Wilkersons were evidently farmers, for in the

letters to his father, James reported the condi-
tion of the crops as he went from place to place,
He was sent to Petersburg in the late summer of

1864 where he remained until the spring of 1865.

 
Wilkerson, James King 2
Here he was almost constantly in active service,
although he received only a scalp wound in
February, 1865. In March, 1865, James was in
the General Hospital at Greensboro, N. C., but
there is no indication of the nature of his
illness or his wound,

There are also many letters of James K.

 

Wilkerson's daughter, Lillie, and son Luther.
Many of them are love letters to Lillie. The
set also includes a number of almanacs which
James K. used as diaries,

 
Wilkerson, James King 3
The chief value of. this collection lies in
the Civil War letters. One (April 8, 1862)
tells of people turning out to see the Merrimac.
Another (Oct. 6, 1862) tells how soldiers were
ordered to charge bayonets on their comrades
who were having difficulty keeping up on the
long, strenuous marches and how, when one would

 

fall, someone would be left to watch him with
orders to shoot him if threatened with capture
by the Yankees,

Another interesting feature of the set is

 
Wilkerson, James King 4
two issues of the Berea Gazette, a very small
newspaper printed in Berea, N. C. One is of
1876, just after the Hayes-Tilden election, and
the other dated shortly thereafter.

Wilkes Family. Papers. Washington, D.C.

 

The primary correspondent in this collection
is Charles Wilkes (1798-1877), naval officer and
explorer, who was a collateral descendant of
John Wilkes (1727-1797), the noted English poli-
tician. Charles Wilkes was born in New York
City, the son of John De Ponthieu and Mary

(Seton) Wilkes. From 1815 through 1817 Wilkes
was in the merchant service on board several
ships until he was appointed midshipman in the
U.S. Navy on Jan. 1, 1818. His naval career was
destined to be a rather distinguished, yet con-

 
Wilkes Family 2

 

troversial one. During the next fifteen years
he served on board several ships including the
Franklin and the Waterwitch, was promoted to
lieutenant in 1826, and surveyed the Narragan-
sett Bay in 1832-1833. Wilkes's scientific
achievements were rewarded by his appointment to
take charge of the Depot of Charts and Instru-

 

ments in Washington, D. C. in 1833. In 1837 and
1838 he was involved in further surveying work
at the shoals of Georges Bank and the Savannah
River.

In 1838 Secretary of War Poinsett ordered

 
Wilkes Family 3
Wilkes to command the South Seas Surveying and
Exploring Expedition. This expedition and the
publications concerning it provided the primary
focus for his career until 1861. This Exploring
Expedition, which was absent from the United
States from 1838 to 1842, had as its chief fields
of exploration the islands of the Pacific Ocean,
the coast of the Antarctic continent, and the
American northwest coast. From 1843 to 1861,
Wilkes was assigned to special duty, chiefly to
be in charge of the Exploring Expedition's col-
lections and reports. In 1844 his Narrative of

 

 
Wilkes Family 4

 

the United States Exploring Expedition was pub-
lished and scientific volumes appeared from time
to time. In 1842 Wilkes had been tried by a
court-martial and sentenced to be publicly rep-
rimanded for illegally punishing some of his men
Despite this he was promoted to commander in
1843 and to captain in 1855.

During the Civil War Charles Wilkes took the
controversial step of overhauling the British
mail steamer Trent and removed by force the Con-
federate commissioners James Mason and John
Slidell. He saw other service in a variety of

 

 
Wilkes Family

 

commands and received promotion to commodore and
then to acting rear admiral in 1862. Again in
1864 Wilkes was court-martialed and found
guilty. Two years later he was promoted to rear
admiral on the retired list, and was placed on
special duty for a part of 1870-1873. After the
Civil War he purchased the iron works at High
Shoals, N. C., and pursued business interests
there for several years.

Wilkes was married twice: first to Jane
Jeffrey Renwick, sister of James Renwick (1792-
1863) in 1826, and then to Mary H. (Lynch)
Bolton in 1854, after i the death of his first

 
Wilkes Family 6

 

wife. He had six children from these marriages.

tion Folder in box 1 of the collection.

 

 

 

 

John ("Jack") Wilkes (1827-1908), sailor and
businessman, was the son of Charles Wilkes as
well as a correspondent in this collection. Im-
mediately after his appointment as a midshipman
on September 9, 1841, young Wilkes was sent to

 
Wilkes Family 7

 

sea. He served on the Delaware and on the Mis-
sissippi in the Gulf Squadron during the Mexican
War. His appointment to the U. S. Naval Academy
came in 1846. After graduation he was assigned
to duty on the Albany and on the Marion. In
about 1848 his father had him transferred for a
time to work on the charts and calculations of

the Exploring Expedition. On Nov. 3, 1854, he
resigned his commission.

John Wilkes settled in Charlotte, N. C., in
December, 1853, probably during a leave of ab-
sence from the U. S. Navy. He moved to North

 
Wilkes Family 8

 

Carolina to supervise certain mining and milling
property, but in 1858 purchased the Mecklenburg
Flour Mills. The next year he became the pro-
prietor of what would eventually be titled the
Mecklenburg Iron Works. During the Civil War
Wilkes took an active role in the Southern ef-
fort through his service in the local vigilance
committee and the Home Guards, and as a finan-
Cial advisor to North Carolina state officials.
Wilkes also became a railroad contractor in gov-
ernment service.

In August, 1869, Wilkes obtained a charter

 
Wilkes Family 9

 

for the First National Bank of Charlotte and
served as its first president until 1869. This
bank had the distinction of being the first
national bank established south of Richmond.
Wilkes formed a business partnership in the Rock
Island Woolen Mills, but after its failure he
devoted his wenrey ' to the successful Mecklenburg
Iron Works.

Wilkes married Jane Renwick Smedberg of New
York in April, 1854. Mrs. Wilkes became a prom-
inent Charlotte philanthropist. The couple had
nine children, five of whom died at a young age.

The largest section in this collection is
the correspondence, 1816-1876. It covers such
subjects as the naval cruises of Charles Wilkes
and his son, John; the Exploring Expedition,
1838-1842, in terms of preliminary planning, the

 
Wilkes Family

 

voyage itself and detailed descriptions of
places visited, and publishing the results of
the expedition; gold mining and milling in North
Carolina; the Civil War; and Wilkes family busi-
ness ventures in North Carolina. There are many
letters written by prominent persons, including
a particularly rich section containing letters
of scientists in 1848 and 1849. Also there is a
lengthy series of James Renwick (1792-1863) and
Charles Wilkes correspondence. Other groups of
papers are the clippings, financial papers,
legal papers, miscellany, printed material,

 
Wilkes Family 12

 

writings, and volumes.

This sketch for the card catalog is an abbre-
viated one. A guide is in the Inventory..File
~drawer sit contains a more comprehensive de-
scription of the contents. Included in the
guide also are a selected listing of prominent
correspondents and a detailed listing of sub-
jects and dates covered in. the collection.

The majority of the letters in the correspond
ence are addressed to Charles Wilkes. Most of
the early letters to 1818 are those of John
Wilkes to his son Charles concerning the son's

 

 
Wilkes Family ia

 

early naval career and the father's advice per-
taining to it.

In the 1820s begin letters from Charles
Wilkes while on naval voyages, 1822-1823. The
bulk of the letters for this period falls in
1825, while Wilkes was in Washington, D. C.,
describing social occasions, visiting friends,

and prominent personages, including President
and Mrs. John Quincy Adams, Mrs. Calhoun, and
Prince Achille Napoleon Murat. A lengthy series
of James Renwick (1792-1863) letters begins in
1828 and continues to 1854. Also in 1828 and

 
Wilkes Family 14

 

1829 letters begin in reference to preliminary
plans for an exploring expedition. In the 1820s
there begin series of correspondence among
Wilkes family members that continue in varying
degrees throughout the collection.

From July, 1830, to May, 1831, Charles Wilkes
was on an extended Mediterranean cruise. As a

result there are many lengthy letters that are
replete with detailed descriptions of the areas
visited. A long series of letters from Henry
Wilkes in New York to his brother Charles in
Washington, D. C., appears from 1834 through the

 
Wilkes Family is

 

1840s, representing primarily business, finan-
cial, and property topics. By mid-1836, some
correspondence begins to appear concerning pre-
parations for the coming Exploring Expedition.
For example, letters concern funding, purchasing
of scientific instruments, organization of the
expedition, who will command it, speculation as

to whether or not Wilkes will go, and plans and
preparations for staffing and equipment.

From August, 1838 to June, 1842, Charles
Wilkes was the commander of the U. S. Exploring
Expedition. Writing from the U.S.S. Vincennes

 
Wilkes Family 16

 

to his wife, his letters are generally lengthy
and marvelously detailed. Although little infor
mation is included about the specifics of the
scientific experiments and specimen gathering,
there is a wealth of information about the peopl¢
and places visited. Please consult the guide in
Box 1 for further information about this voyage.

His letters also referred to discipline problems
on board ship, the officers of the squadron, the
spirit of overall harmony on the expedition, and
an apparent lack of support for the expedition

by the U.S. government. Letters in 1842 concern

 
Wilkes Family 17

 

Wilkes's promotion and court-martial.

There begins in the late 1830s and 1840s
correspondence between Charles Wilkes and his
children, and among the children, which will
continue throughout the collection.

In the 1840s during the post Exploring Expe-
dition period, John Wilkes (1827-1908) wrote

descriptive letters about ports he visited while
on various naval cruises. He served on board
the _U.S.S. Mississippi, the U.S.S. Albany, and
the U.S.S. Marion.

A series of correspondence between Charles

 

 
Wilkes Family 18

 

Wilkes and his younger son, Edmund, dates from
August, 1848, through 1849, while the son was in
Charlotte, N. C., overseeing some mining and
milling property. Much information is revealed
in these letters about mining and milling efforts
in the Charlotte area.

The period, 1848 to 1849, is an especially
rich one for this collection in terms of the
correspondence of prominent persons it contains.
From 1843 to 1861, Charles Wilkes was assigned
to special service, preparing for publication
the information collected on the Exploring Expe-

 
Wilkes Family 19

 

dition. In the course of this work he received
letters from many prominent scientists, naval
officers, senators and congressmen, and states-
men. Please consult the guide for an extensive
listing of correspondents.

The correspondence for the 1850s continues
two important themes of the collection: the

continuing work concerning the Exploring Expe-
dition, and gold mining and milling in North
Carolina. Letters refer to descriptions made of
expedition specimens as well as appropriations
and bills for its work. Letters from many prom-

 
Wilkes Family 20

 

inent scientists appear, such as Jean Rodolphe
Agassiz, Asa Gray, William Sullivant, and
Spencer F. Baird. ,

A very long series of letters between Charles
Wilkes and his son Edmund continues from the
1840s through the 1850s. These letters concern
the mills at St. Catherine's Mills near

Charlotte, N. C.; financial matters; and his
Career as a railroad engineer. The very long
series of letters from John Wilkes to his father
Charles continues in the 1850s. Of interest are
letters pertaining to mining and milling opera-

 
Wilkes Family Zi

 

tions in the Charlotte area where John had moved
in 1853. John wrote about the condition of
various mines, mining operations, the Capps Min-
ing Company, the St. Catherine's Mills, stamp
mills, flour and corn milling, and the Mecklen-
burg Flour Mills.

There is considerably less bulk for the 1860s
and 1870s than for earlier years. Throughout
the Civil War period are references to various
battles, ships, naval and army officers, and
views on the war. On November 8, 1861, Charles
Wilkes removed the Confederate commissioners

 
Wilkes Family 22
Mason and Slidell from the British ship Trent.
Two letters in 1862, written by Michele Costi,
strongly defend Wilkes's controversial actions i
the Trent affair. Other letters in 1862 and 186
concern various aspects of the U.S. Navy, such
as health, medical care, surgeons, liquor, and
deserters; and General McClellan. In July and
August, 1862, there is a series of letters from
Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to Wilkes.
Only a handful of letters exist for 1864. At
the conclusion of the Civil War, John Wilkes's
letters from Charlotte to his father resume.
They pertain to con- @ street in North

 

Carolina during Recon- struction, the Mecklen

 
Wilkes Family 22

 

burg Iron Works, the Rock Island Manufacturing
Company, and the High Shoals Iron Works.

The correspondence for the 1870s consists
primarily of family letters, mostly written by
John Wilkes to his father. Other letters per-
tain to the continuing work of the Exploring
Expedition publishing efforts.

The two clippings are a picture of Charles
Wilkes and an article, 1862, concerning publica-
tion of the results of the Exploring Expedition.

The financial papers, 1830-1875, include such
items as financial statements, Exploring Expedi-

tion statements, bills, receipts, cost esti-
mate, and a bond. .

 
Wilkes Family 24

 

In the legal papers, which span the years
1827-1865, are indentures, articles of associa-
tion and other papers for the Jackson City
Association, plats, and court documents.

The miscellany consists of papers, 1825-1875.
Included are items referring to the Exploring
Expedition and three depositions in 1862 concern

ing fortifications at Drewry's Bluff. Other
Civil War papers in 1863 and 1864 relate to the
court-martial of Wilkes.

The printed material spans the years, 1849-
1874. Included are a broadside, "Siege of

 
Wilkes Family 25

 

Suffolk...Chancellorsville,"” and "Report on the
High Shoals Property in Gaston County, North
Carolina." Other titles are "Working the Gold
Mines in New Granada," "Prospectus of the
American Review," and "Map of the City of
Zanesville."

While the writings cover the two years, 1862
to 1863, most of them are undated. Included is
a copy in Italian of "In difesa del San
Giacinto," 1862, by Michele Costi. Related
items are "The Surrender of Mason and Slidell"
and another article defending Wilkes's actions

 

 
Wilkes Family 26

 

in the Trent Affair. Two folders contain his
sixteen-chapter manuscript, "Trip to the Far
West." Other undated writings describe various
aspects of New York City, ironclad vessels, New
Jersey, and Baltimore.

The volumes, 1823-1847, include account books
of Charles Wilkes, a chemistry notebook owned

by Edmund Wilkes, and "Notes Related to Fejee
/ sic/ Islands." Charles Wilkes wrote the
latter from July 15 to August 7, 1840, while on
the Exploring Expedition.

Two oversize items in the Picture Cabinet are

 
Wilkes Family 27

 

"Map of the World..." by Charles Wilkes, 1856,
and a broadside, including a plat of several
lots of Charles Wilkes's land in Washington,
D.C., for sale, May 12, 1874.

The John M. Richardson Books and William
Preston Bynum Papers in the Southern Historical
Collection at Chapel Hill contain material

related to Charles Wilkes and his family.

1 item added, 7-1-81: A commission appoint-
ing’ Charles Wilkes a commodore in the U.S. Navy
on the Retired List from July 16, 1862. The

John Darragh Wilkins (1822-1900), army
officer, graduated from the United States Mili-
tary Academy in 1846. He saw action in the
Mexican War at the Battles of Contreras and
Churubusco. Between the Mexican War and the
Civil War, Wilkins was assigned to frontier duty
in Texas and New Mexico, In the Civil War, he
saw action at Malvern Hill, Fredericksburg, and
Chancellorsville, receiving two brevets for gal-
lant and meritorious service. During the Civil

 
Wilkins, John Darragh 2

 

War, he served in the Third Infantry until May,
1864, when he joined the Fifteenth Infantry. He
was present at the Siege of Petersburg in 1865
and remained in the army until retirement in
1886, having attained the rank of colonel.
Further information on Wilkins is in Gen.

Cullum's Biographical Register of the Officers
and Graduates of the United States Military
Academy.

The spelling of Wilkins' middle name is
probably Darragh but that is not certain.

 

 

 
Wilkins, John Darragh 2a
Cullum and Heitman list it as “Darragh,” but it
appears as "Dariah" in the Register of Graduates
U. S, Military Academy. The obituary notice in
the Washington Post (Feb. 31, 1900, p. 3) gives
the spelling as "Darragh."' He was then a
resident of Washington.

 

 

 

This collection consists of fifteen letters
sent by Wilkins to his wife between 1858 and
1869, a sketchbook, five loose sketches, and a

 
Wilkins, John Darragh

photograph of an army officer, probably Wilkins.
One letter from ’Albuquerque, New Mexico, of
May 14, 1858, describes living conditions at
that frontier post. Five letters were written
from Newport Barracks, Kentucky, between July 9
and August 7, 1860. These mention camp life,
weather and other routine concerns of Wilkins,

 

including how to get his wife from-Pittsburgh to
the post. The letter of August 7 mentions that
Kentuckians of that area favor John Bell in the
upcoming presidential election. Two letters, of

 
Wilkins, John Darragh 4

 

January 27 and February 3, 1867, originated at
Dahlonega, Georgia. These describe the condi-
tions of the post there, as well as the horrid
state of roads in Georgia and the deplorable co
ditions of the U. S. Mint there. Six letters
were written by Wilkins from Mobile, Alabama,
between October 19, 1868, and Febraury 2, 1869.
In these letters are mentioned an article of
female apparel called a "Grecian bend," politi-
cal views of local citizens, bad economic times,
and Wilkins' relief that he is not being sent to

 
Wilkins, John Darragh 5
Texas. One letter of October 1, 1869, from Fort
Macon, North Carolina, describes officer's cot-
tages there.

The sketchbook contains many pencil drawings
related to the Civil War. Among these are
sketches of some of Wilkins's fellow officers,
Burnside's Bridge at Antietam, and a deserter at
Fredericksburg. Three sketches of officers are
labeled McCool, Page, and Hamilton, These are
probably sketches of Joseph Addison McCool, John
Henry Page, and Louis Mclane Hamilton, who were
in rt Third Infantry with Wilkins. Also in the

 

 
Wilkins, John Darragh

sketchbook is a caricature of Horace Greeley
after the 1872 election. Four of the loose
sketches are concerned with Andersonville. Two
show Captain Henry Wirz mistreating the prison-
ers, and two show escapees from the prison being
chased by hounds and given refuge by a Negress
in a log cabin.

 

The occurence of drawings of Wilkins' associ:
ates as well as some places where he served sug-
gest that he was the artist. However, he was
apparently not a prisoner at Andersonville, so

 
Wilkins, John Darragh

these sketches may only represent his conception
of what life was like there, if he was the artist
of those particular sketches. Unidentified por-
traits in the sketchbook may represent other
personnel of the Third Infantry.

One volume in the collection contains re-
cords from Hopewell Methodist Church in the
Catawba Circuit, 1884-1895. The volume includes
Sunday School records, library lending records,
and minutes of church meetings (Vol. 2628).

Wilkinson was an exhorter in the Methodist
Church, and his papers and volumes include
numerous references to Hopewell Church and to
other churches in Catawba County.

Wilkinson's Diary & Account Book, 1880-1886,
includes (pp. 2-3) a plan of an orchard with

notes on the.varieties of fruit trees and where he ob-
tained them, Part of this orchard still exists in 1986
on the farm of Leonard Jones, Route 2, Catawba, N.C.
28609 according to Martha Gail Drum (Route 2, Box 158BB,
Catawba, N.C.) who is familiar with the site. This
volume also contains references and accounts for the
operation of Wilkinson's gold mine beginning in 1881
and continuing to at least 1885. On Oct, 31, 1882, he
noted his 35th birthday, so his date of birth was

Oct. 31, 1847.

honorary secretary of the Protestant Society for
the Protection of Religious Freedom. He was an
M.P. for Boston in Lincolnshire from 1830-1837.

 

On July 13, 1830, Sir Robert Peel, Second Barn

John Wilks, On Jan. 3, 1840, Holland stated
that there was neither an intention nor the pro-

t:-e of his responsibility for the appointment
of magistrates.

Dudley Coutts Stuart, prominent advocate of
relief for the Polish refugees, asked Wilks

These four letters are chiefly concerned with
family affairs. The first, addressed to Mrs.
Almira Barnes, probably a relative of the Will-

early marriage of his son. Clarence Willard
was at this time a student at a private school

Willard, Margaret (Bradley). Papers. Madison,
New Haven County, Connecticut

 

The collection centers around members of the
Willard and Bradley families from Madison,
Connecticut. Most of them are addressed to
Margaret Willard, wife of Samuel F. Willard
and daughter of Margaret and Talcott Bradley.

The bulk of the collection dates from 1860-
1870.

Included are letters from brothers Henry,
John and William Bradley and from their sister

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley)

 

Emily to Margaret Willard. There are also
several letters to Margaret from her husband
and mother. Henry, John, William and Samuel
were Union soldiers and the bulk of the col-
lection includes letters to family members
from them. Letters dating from the 1870's

and 1880's include several from Margaret
Willard's acquaintances. There are also some
legal documents, financial papers, bills,
receipts, pictures, and miscellany.

Family relationships particularly come to

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 3
light including parent/child, brother/sister,
husband/wife and in-law. The Bradley children
particularly revere their mother. In a letter,
April 8, 1864, John writing to Henry says,
"I do not know what we should do without our
dear mother if she should be called away. A
mother is the main stay to keep a family to-
gether."

Margaret's parents were farmers in Madison.
As late as April 28, 1872, they were stiil en-
gaged in farming. In the early 1860's, John
was in McGregor, Iowa, located near the Missis-

 

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) ot
Sippi River. He ran a store. While he expres-
ses enthusiasm for McGregor, he also indicates
he is homesick for Madison. By October 1862,
however, John had joined the Union Army. Sam-
uel and Margaret Willard were milliners in
Madison. Ina letter, September 19, 1861, John

 

writes from McGregor to his mother that he
would like to encourage Samuel and Margaret to
move to McGregor and go into business.
Religion played a large part in the corre-
spondents' letters--particularly when someone

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 5
was Sick or dying. Statements such as the fol-
lowing were common. John describing someone's
impending death in a letter, Feb. 7, 1861, said,
"She is going home where no pains and sorrows
exist, where all is love."

One learns about the many different aspects
of camp life through the letters, including the

 

clothing, food, shelter, picket duty and sick-
ness among the troops. Several references are
made to superior officers including Sherman,
McClellan, Burnside, Hunter and Hooker.

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley)

John, Samuel and Henry were stationed in
Maryland and Virginia during the conflict, while
William was for the most part near Hilton Head
and Beaufort, South Carolina. From the letters
one learns that John took part in several mili-
tary engagements. In November, 1864, he writes

 

that he has participated in twenty-two battles
and skirmishes. They included the Chancellors-
ville campaign in May, 1863, Gettysburg cam-
paign in July, 1863, and the siege of Petersburg
in 1864. Several letters written in the early

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 7
months of the war give a glimpse of the enthu-
siasm surrounding forming military companies
and for the war in general. John said the

West is "getting ready as fast as they can...
we are all Union men, no Democrat no Republican
no party, but all stand up for our country."
William writing from Hartford, Connecticut,

May 6, 1861, describes how enthusiastic the

men in his company are to get on with the fight
and closes his letter, "Your Will with musket
in hand." As the war drags on, however, enthus
iasm and morale among the troops wane, as sev-

 

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 8
eral letters written in 1862 and early 1863 il-
lustrate. By November, 1863, optimism again is
shown. John expresses in a letter, November
18, 1863, that the rebels having been repulsed
at Bristoe Station and on the Rappahannock
River has been a turning point.

Several times the loyalty people in Madison

 

had for the Union is questioned. John writing
to his mother, May 26, 1861, said he had heard
some men in Madison had "rebel principles."

He said these men "are worse than Southerners."

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 9
On May 18, 1864, John writing to Margaret said,
"those men at home love money morethan country.'
One is able to get a sense of how potential
soldiers could vie for military positions. In
a letter, November 7, 1861, Edward Willard,
Samuel's brother, writes to him from Scranton,

 

Pennsylvania, indicating that if Samuel had
acted sooner he could have used his influence
to secure a good position for him in the 55th
Pennsylvania Regiment.

Several letters describe how soldiers viewed

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 10
blacks. Ina letter, November 30, 1862, Henry
writes to his sister Emily that the war was
"sacrificing a great many white men for a few
niggers." Ina letter, January 24, 1863, Wil-
liam writes from Hilton Head, South Carolina,
about negroes. He describes them as "a poor

 

miserable lazy set and an expense to the gov-
ernment and an eye sore to’ the soldiers." He
said the political war would not end as long as
there is a "nigger alive and Uncle Sam has any
money." On the other hand, Samuel writing in

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) ll
1862 said, "darkies quite civilized to what
they are at home. I am favorably impressed wit
Negro life in Va. and Md."

The family suffers several tragedies during
the Civil War. Samuel, John and William all
die during the conflict. Samuel, Captain of

 

the 14th Regiment Connecticut Volunteers, died
at the Battle of Antietam, September 17, 1862.
William who according to a letter dated April
30, 1864, was in the 6th Regiment of the Con-
necticut Volunteers, died during the middle of

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 12
1864. It is unclear where, but in the last
letter in the collection from him, he was on
his way to Fortress Monroe (April 30, 1864).
John was, according to a letter dated April 8,
1864, also in the 14th Regiment of the Connect-
icut Volunteers and died at City Point, Virgin-

 

ia in the early months of 1865. Henry was in
the lst Regiment, Minnesota Volunteers and
surivived the conflict. He later married a
"Southern girl" from Augusta, Georgia, in the
early 1870's. Many of the letters reflect the

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 13
personal grief suffered by various family mem-
bers due to these losses. Particularly anguish
ing are the family members' wait for William's
body to be returned to Madison for funeral and
burial. Included in the collection are several
condolences from fellow soldiers who served
with Samuel in the 14th Regiment of the Con-

 

necticut Volunteers. One can get a very good
picture of how family members reacted to Sam-
uel's death and how they grieved with Margaret
Willard as she mourned his loss.

Pensions for wives of soldiers who lost

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 14
their lives are mentioned as they related to
Margaret Willard and William's wife. Margaret
received a pension of $20.00 a month. Ina
letter dated January 4, 1865, Margaret's mother
wrote that William's wife was having a problem
getting her pension because the question was

 

Still pending as to whether or not William's
disease was contracted in the Army or not.
Several letters concern the election of
1864, in particular McClellan's nomination.
On October 11, 1864, Emily writes to Margaret

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) LS
Willard, that people who had sympathy for the
South would vote for McClellan. She said when
the rebels heard McClellan was nominated "they
cheered."

One gets a view of different aspects of life
in the 19th century, including railroad travel,
housework and diseases. Many letters contain
information about various friends' and rela-
tives' health. No fewer than fifteen ailments
are mentioned.

In late 1864, Margaret moved to Fulton,

 

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) Lo
New York, for awhile, it appears to take care
of ailing relatives. Then begins a series of
letters from Margaret Bradley to her daughter
Margaret Willard, addressed to "My dear child."
Apparently, Margaret Willard had many ac-
quaintances. She taught Sabbath School, al-
though it is unstated as to which religious
denomination she belonged. There are several
letters to her from young people. Margaret
later moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, and
on December 17, 1869 she was in New York City.

 

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) L7
She appears to have been the benefactress to
several people. Ina letter, January 24, 1871,
Margaret's mother writes that she hopes Mar-
garet will do a "great good" in instructing
boys committed to her care. It is unclear
where she is teaching.

Margaret Willard received a letter from Mrs.
A. V. Mumford dated February 19, 1880, from
Philippopolis (then in Eastern Turkey, now in
Bulgaria), about her mission work there. In
later letters it is indicated that Mrs. Willard
planned to go there to teach and that she also

 

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 18
planned to provide some monetary support for
the mission. It is unstated what religious

denomination the mission was affiliated with.
The mission is referred to as the "Bulgarian
Faith Mission." Mrs. Willard is directed to
send any money she wishes to contribute to

O. M. Brown, who is apparently serving as an

 

intermediary for the mission, in Oberlin, Ohio.
In a later letter, Brown instructs Mrs. Willard
how to arrange her belongings for custom in-
spection in Turkey. In a letter dated June 4,
1883, Brown criticized ministers who were bound

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) cr iS
to missionary societies and cannot "see a more
excellent way." It is not revealed in the col-
lection whether or not Mrs. Willard ever went
to Turkey. However, a number of photographs
of men, women, and children are from eastern
Europe and may relate to the mission work.

 

There are several photographic views of Buch-
arest, Romania.

Before the Civil War, Samuel Willard was in-
volved with selling a remedy, Wauregan Salt
Rheum Remedy, for salt rheum (skin disease

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 20
Similar to eczema). After Samuel's death,
Samuel's brother, Edward, encourages Mrs.
Willard to buy all rights for selling the rem-
edy from Mr. Hotchkiss in order that he and
Mrs. Willard could sell it (March 2, 1869).
There are several letters from Edward to Mrs.
Willard, encouraging her in this business. He

 

said he would be willing to pay people to help
Margaret.

There are a small number of financial papers
including receipts from an express and furni-
ture company. There are also several legal

 
Willard, Margaret (Bradley) 22

 

documents. Among them are wills, information
about Margaret Willard's pension, a fire in-
surance policy and land transfers.

Letters and other papers of the S. G. Wil-

was pastor of the First Congregational Church.
Most of the letters deal with family matters,
and many of them are undated. Correspondence

from Willard's congregation discusses such mat-
ters as church repairs, the Sunday School,
women's projects, and philanthropy. There are
letters from a son who attended Yale and a
daughter who attended Smith College which give

 
Willard, 5S. G.

 

interesting and amusing insights into college
life in the late nineteenth century. A letter
from Willard's son, Jan. 23, 1880, mentions that
he is reading Darwin and beginning to feel that
the Englishman is correct "as to the origin of
the Human Species." Daughter Abbie Willard

writes on Dec. 17, 1882, that General Samuel C.

Bew collections pertaining to the
activities of Virginians not famed politi-
cally can be quite so valuable as these
papers which center around the life of James
M. Willcox, successful as an ente-bellum
planter in Charles City County. In brief,
they constitute an excellent record of
farming operations and family ties in the
late ante-bellum period, during the Civil
War, and in the time of Reconstruction.

Willcox and Lamb families, untted by the
marriage of James M. Willcox (b.Dec.8, 1804)

May 9,1864); Susannah P, (b. Apri17,1836)

and it 41s nossible that a daughter Flizabeth -
Sherred was also a child of this union.

There 1s a gap in '@: from 1840 until

1849 after which ti me James M. Will@ox

 
WILLCOX, James M. Sketch (4)
began writing to his children with their
grandfather at Frankford, Pa.

It may therefore be assumed that James
M. Willcox had by the late 1840's not only
lost his first wife but had also remarried.
From that time on he frequently referred to
his other children who were born from around

 

1840 until the Civil War. Among the childre
of this second union were Eugenia, Robert,
James, Taylor, Augustus, Philip, Edward

and Lee. James M. Willcox himself was
&pparently the son of H.V.Willcox of "Belle

 
WILLCOX, James M. Sketch (5)
Air" in Charles City County.

Practically all of the letters of
this collection were written to Susannah
P. Willcox the eldest daughter of James
M. Willcox, although some of the earlier
ones were written to others. She made her
home with her grandperents in Frankford,
Pa., spent considerable time at her father's
home "Buckland" and visited among her re-
latives in Norfolk, Richmond, Pittsylvania
County and Halifax County Va. The corres-
pondenege of her father and mother is included
but the greatest “Ss the letters came

 

 
WILLCOX, James MM. Sketch (6)
from James M. Willcox. Others were written
by Walter A. Rorer of the 20th Mississippi
Regiment, during the Civil War, by Eliza
C. Rines, Elizabeth B. Towns of Bannister
near Danville, Va. and Mary B. Rodney.

The early letters from 1831 to 1839
are generally writéen by Dr. Lamb to his

 

duaghter, Mary Ann S. and by her and her
various cousins including her husband-to-be.
Her letters reflect a carefree life in
Charles City County during the 1830's.
Several of them, expecially two (May 28 and

June 10, 1831) ne horse racing in the

country including t

acing of William

WILLCOX, James M. Sketch (7)

 

M. Willcox (Nov. 9, 1831) referred to Nat
Turner and later (Aug. 13, 1832) described
the condition of Monticello. Various refer-
ences are made to parties, methods and means
of travelling and the outbreak of cholera
in Norfolk.

The letters of James M. Willcox to
his daughter Susannah, by far the most im-
portant of tne collection, are concerned
with his children, with the operation of

his two plantation, "Peace Hill" and "Buck-

land", with #.-o#en with the
effects of the var, Qin the killing of

 
WILLCOX, James M. Sketch (8)

 

his son Lamb by marauding federal soldiers,
with his own hiding from the soldiers and
with the difficulties of farming during the
year 1865 to 1871. It is seldom that papers
showing the effect of the Civil War in
eastern Virginia come to light, so general

was the Yankee pbundering. Willcox was a
man of education and wealth. He was a M@fber
of the Virginia House of Delegates in 1860
and was therefore singled out for considerablé
persecution by the federal soldiers during

the war. Moreover, he experienced much
agifficulty in obtai ing a pardon and,

 
Willcox, James M. 9

 

indeed, there is no record that he ever suc-
ceeded. He frequently included diatribes
against the "Radicals" for their handling of
political affairs during Reconstruction years.
The letters of Walter A. Rorer of the 20th
Mississippi Regiment, whose home was in Aber-

deen, Mississippi, not only furnish excellent
descriptions of camp life, and campaigning but
they reflect the spirit of a man whose motives
were actuated by a sense of nobless oblige.
With a furlough in his pocket, he returned to

 

 
Willcox, James M, 10

 

his regiment because of a sense of duty and
responsibility induced by frequent appearances
of men endeavoring to leave the front lines and
skulk in the rear in time of battle. His de-
scriptions of the Confederate soldier's clothing
food, campaigns, the appearance and character

of high Confederate officers, marches and re-
views are seldom equalled. His letters are
more often concerned with the defense of Vicks-
burg, although the last one was dated "Line of
Battle near Kennesaw Mountain", June 8, 1864.

See Information Folder in Box 1 for a copy of
the article, "Confederate Generals—the View
from Below} Civil War Times Illustrated, Volume
XVIII, Number 4, July, 1979, which reproduces
four letters from Rorer. Rorer's name is in-
correctly spelled Roher in the article. The

 

correct spelling, Rorer, can be verified by the
signatures on several letters, e.g., November
12, 1863, February 24, 1864, June 8, 1864, and
in numerous entries in Volumes 7, 24, and 52,

ation of the Official Records of the Union and

The letters of several girls, friends and
relatives of Susannah Willcox, are worthy of
note. The most outstanding were written by
Eliza C. Rives, a widow with several children

 

 

and an aged mother. Despite her almost futile

attempts to support her dependents by operating
a tobacco farm in Halifax county after the War,
she failed to lose her high spirits completely.
Her letters are well written and detailed.

 
Willcox, James M, i

 

Elizabeth B. Towns, a cousin, also wrote numer-
ous letters in the collection and Mary B. Rod-
ney of Delaware but a governess at Westover

plantation wrote frequently. The Willcox famil
attended church at Westover and were friends of
the Seldens who lived at Westover. Her stay in

Virginia during a part of the war period and
the stay of Susannah Willcox in the same state
while her grandparents were in Frankford, Pa.,
gave rise to numerous statements regarding com-
munications between the North and South from

 
Willcox, James M.

1861 to 1865.
The Willcox papers contain excellent materia
for a study of the Confederate period.

Letter of Feb. 26, 1861 written from

in N. C. Willcox gives his views on secession
and some other matters and makes reference
to views of his brother, who was still a Union-

points on which they agreed were that S. C.

had been too hasty in seceding and that England
had the best government in the world. He dis-

Henry Willey (1824-1897) was most well-known
for his work with lichens, but his botanical
interests were principally a hobby. His various
occupations included teaching school, practicing

law, and writing for the Daily Evening Standard.

Willey achieved a high level of competence in
his avocation, however, and his research and
writings in the field of lichenology were exten-
sive.

The items in this collection concern in large

 
Willey, Henry 2

part the work of Edward Tuckerman, another noted
lichenologist. Letters from several prominent
botanists were written to Willey lamenting
Tuckerman's death in 1896. Articles by and
about Tuckerman clipped by Willey from various
journals are also included among his papers,
Professor William L Culberson has placed in the

 

collection a reprint of the preface to his edi-
tion of Tuckerman's lichenological papers and
an index he compiled to Willey's revision of
Synopsis of the Genus Arthonia, an unpublished
manuscript written in 1897 and included in this

 
Willey, Henry 3
collection.

The volumes are manuscript drafts of books
and articles by Willey, a catalog of the works
on lichens in his library, and copies he made
of two articles by Tuckerman.

Two of the letters were addressed to Charles
James Sprague. One was found in a book owned

 

by Willey, and another was sent to him with a
note by Sprague. The other letters were also
found in books which had formerly been in his

library. When Duke University purchased these

 
Willey, Henry 4

books, all manuscript material was sent to
this department. It is this material which

now comprises the Willey Collection in the Manu
script Department.

Albert J. Williams was a substantial farmer
who lived in the vicinity of Mount Olive, North
Carolina. He is listed among "Principal Farmers
Who Receive Mail Through Mt. Olive Postoffice"
in The North Carolina Year Book and Business

 

Directory 1916, p. 562. One of his printed
envelopes has his address as "Mount Olive, N.C.,
R.F.D. No. 1." This envelope and a number of
other items addressed to him at Mt. Olive were

 

 
Williams, Albert J.

found within his five ledgers of 1906-1935.
These items have been retained as evidence of
his ownership of the volumes.

The ledgers, 1906-1935, are for a mercantile
business. The North Carolina Year Book never
lists Williams among the local merchants either
in town or out in the countryside. It is clear

 

 

from his ledgers that he did have a store, appar
ently a small one that quite probably was asso-
ciated with his farm. Entries for payment by
work can be found in accounts in all the volumes

Williams was born on January 30, 1890, in
North Carolina. He received a bachelor of
science degree from the University of North
Carolina in 1910. From the collection one
learns that Williams obtained a-~license to

practice civil engineering from the city of

Asheville in July, 1917. Williams was a member
of Company D of the 105th Engineers Regiment of
the 30th Division of the American Expeditionary

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor 2
Force in the latter part of World War I. He
entered service as a 2nd Lieutenant on Feb. 20,
1919. He received training at Camp Sevier and
Camp Jackson, S. C., before departing for France
on the Zealandia in mid-1918. He was with the
30th Division when it fought in Belgium and
France in October, 1918, and was among the group
that broke through the Hindenburg Line in 1918.
He was discharged from service on May 13, 1919.
According to information obtained with the
collection, Williams was a water resources

 

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor 3
expert and designer of water supplies and power
plants. According to this information, he de-
signed Rink Mill Dam near Jacksonville, Florida,
about 1921 and an electric power plant at
Asheville in 1922. There are pictures in the
collection of the construction site at Ashe-
ville. Calls to the public library and to the

 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville,
Fla., failed to verify the existence of Rink
Mill Dam there. Doubts about Rink Mill Dam
arose when terrain and vegetation in the

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor
pictures purporting to be those of Rink Mill
Dam did not appear to be Floridian.

Williams married Anne S. Talbutt on July 7,
1925. He became superintendent of the Durham
Water Department succeeding J. C. Michie in
1939. He retired from the Department in 1960.

 

In a form filled out for the National Register
of Scientific and Technical Personnel in 1957,
he lists professional membership in the American
Society of Civil Engineers, the American Water
Works Association and the Federal Sewage and

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor a.
Wastes Association. Williams died in September,
1975, after an extended illness.

The collection is divided into six cate-
gories: correspondence, 1917-1918; addresses
and writings, 1918-1933; miscellany, 1917-1957;
clippings & printed material, 1918-1975;

 

pictures, 1918-1920's; and volumes, 1924-1952.
The correspondence category dates mostly
from the World War I period. It contains
several printed commendations from various
officers thanking the 30th Division for its

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor 6
assistance in the war. The category also con-
tains military orders including a printed one
with a facsimile of John J. Pershing's signature
to the American Expeditionary Force thanking it
for its service.

The addresses and writings folder contains
a statement by Williams written in 1933, which
gives his personal account of his experience in
World War I. Particularly interesting are his
descriptions of the tunnels dug by the Germans
on the Hindenburg Line. This category also

 

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor 7
contains a printed booklet on the operations of
the 30th Division which includes the names of
officers of the different regiments in the 30th
Division. Included in the booklet too are
generals' orders and letters of commendation
written to members of the 30th Division. A
separate typewritten sheet gives a concise

 

history of the operations of the 30th Division
including names and dates of engagements, places
captured, the number of prisoners captured, the
number of civilians liberated, which German

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor

 

Divisions opposed them in each engagement and
general remarks about the engagements.

The miscellany folder includes a physical
examination form filled out in 1918 when
Williams was a member of the 105th Engineer
Regiment and the marriage certificate of
Williams and his wife.

The clippings and printed material are lo-
cated in two places. Some of this material is
located in a small folder and filed with the
bulk of the collection. Anoversize folder

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor 9
containing printed material is located in the
picture cabinets. The smaller folder contains
several newsclippings about the Flat River Dam
near Durham and an article about Durham's water
supply, dated November 15, 1940, after Williams
became superintendent of the Durham Water De-
partment. The larger folder contains: college

 

diplomas of Williams and his wife; a citation
given to Williams recognizing his having been
wounded in World War I; and a 1950 zoning map of

Durham, N. C.

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor 10
The photographs are located in two areas.
Some are with the smaller folders and filed with
the bulk of the collection, and someare in over-
size folders, housed in one of the Department's
picture cabinets. Among the most important of

the photographs are: seven of the men of
Company D, 105th Engineers in uniform; two
photographs of the Zealandia that transported
Williams and other members of Company D to
Europe; one photograph of the barracks at Camp
Jackson, S. C., all these dating from the World

 

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor

 

I period. The other series of photographs of
particular note are from the early 1920s. One
series shows the clearing of land for the
building of a dam, although it is unclear which
dam. Another series is a group of 39 photo-
graphs that shows the clearing of land for the
building of an electric power plant in Ashe-
ville.

The collection contains four volumes: a
report of a study of the power possibilities of
Flat River in combination with its use as-a

municipal water resource (1924); Water Works

 

 
Williams, Daniel McGregor 12
Improvements for the City of Durham, N.C. (1925);
an annual report of the city of Durham N.C.
(1951-1952); and a report to the mayor and
council of Rocky Mount, N. C., on the steps
necessary to insure continuity of electric

power for the town during the five years
following 1928.

G. S. Williams operated a business in Zebu-
lon, N.C., in which he sold and repaired tires
and accessories for both automobiles and bicy-
cles. Service for the automobiles included

vulcanizing.

Williams' business is recorded in his Ac-
count Book, 1916-1929 (84 pp.). He is identi-
fied as the owner of this volume by his name
on its front cover and by a loose statement of
Jan. 1, 1924, found within the volume. The

 
Williams, G. S. 2
statement has his name, address, and business
printed upon it. The names of other members
of the Williams family appear in the volume
and in the loose financial papers found with-
in it, but their names appear in the index of
the volume and his properly does not.

The accounts are primarily those with cus-

 

tomers during 1921-1923, but there are a vari-
ety of other financial records as well. They
include: the cost of operating an automobile,
1917-1919 (pp. 7-8); sales of tires by brands;
a list of magazine subscriptions; accounts for

 
Williams, G. S.

the purchase of real estate; rent; an account
with the Bank of Zebulon; etc. Some customers
were identified as blacks.

The items are financial papers from the
business.

George Frederick Williams was a lawyer and
politician of Beston. He graduated from Dart-
mouth College in 1872 and later studied in
Germany. He then returned home, taught school
and tried newspaper work, and then studied law.
He was admitted to the bar in 1875. In the
1880's he became increasingly active in
Democratic politics and in 1889 was elected to
the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

Two years later he was elected to Congress and
1897 he was the Democratic nominee for governor

 
Williams, George Frederick ae a
in Massachusetts. He served as minister to
Greece in 1913 and 1914. He died in 1932.

The collection consists of Williams’
personal and prefessional correspondence and
papers between 1876 and 1888. The correspon-
dence illustrates his growing law business, his
increasing affluence, and his busy social life,
especially in musical circles in Boston.

There are several letters from American
students at German Universities. On April
17, 1876, Sylvester Baxter, a student at the

University of Berlin, describes Berlin. On

 

 
Williams, George Frederick _ 3

March 8, 1877, he discusses the reaction of
Americans in Europe to the election of 1876

and the mortification it caused them. On Jan.
15, 1877, H. T. Whitney, a student at the Uni-
versity of Heidelberg, describes student life
there, especially among Americans. He deprecates
the German aristocrats at the University.

 

 

Between 1383 and 1885 Asa Palmer French,
clerk to the judges of the Court of Commissioners
of the Alabama Claims, wrote a series of letters
to Willfams. On Jan. 25, 1883, he discusses the

great bulk of work before the Court and the

Slow progress being made. The rights of British
subjects is the topic of a letter of the fol-
lowing March 28.

The collection contains some information
about Massachusetts and national politics.
Williams, a Democrat, allied himself with the
reform element of the party, He cooperated with

like minded “independent" Republicans. George
Ticknor Curtis on Aug.: 31, 1876, writes of his
plans to have his writings read to meetings of
Republicans in order to influence them to vote

Democratic. There isfome information about

anti-Blaine sentiment among Hepublicans in 1883
and 1884. A letter of Jume 19, 1883, announces
a meeting of the Executive Committee of the
"Anti-Blaine Movement,” headed by Moses
Williams. The organization existed a year later
(see letter of June 24, 1884), but soon evolved
into the "Committee of One Hundred," composed

of prominent Republicans (Mugwunps) and indepen-
dents who supported Grover Cleveland (See letter
of Aug., 1884). Letters of Oct. and Nov.,1885,
tell of the efforts of reform Democrats in

Boston to entice Carl Schurz to edit the

 
Williams, George Frederick a 6

 

Boston Post.

George W. Curtis who bolted the Republicans
to support Gleveland on Jan. 7, 1887, writes of
the disillusionment among his friends because
of Cleveland's failure to implement reform. A
letter of Oct. 10, 1887, states that although
the President has been a disappointment, he is
the only hope for reform, especially in the
civil service. On Jan. 29, 1888, Democratic
Representative John E. Russell of Mass. writes
of his conflicting roles as reformer and poli-

tician. Little help is received from

 

 
Williams, George Frederick IE ef
Cleveland. On the following Feb. 15th Russell
discusses the divisions among Democrats in the
House ard his willingness to join the Republi-
cans if they will urge a low tariff and reform.
Cleveland has little power in the House because
he has alienated so many of his Democratic
colleagues.

 

On Feb. 16, 1887, Secretary of War William
C. Endicott relates the difficulty Cleveland is
having over appointments to the new Interstate
Commerce Commission.

The collection contains one box of bills and

 
Williams, George Frederick _§
receipts, and two lesson books, one for German,
the other for chemistry.

The collection ends abruptly in 1888 short-
ly before Williams’ election to the Massachusetts
legislature.

Dos, N.C.

This collection consists of the vapers of
Col. John Williams, an officer in the N.C.
militia during the American Revolution. There
are also two letters addressed to his son,
Jonn Williams, Jr.

The first of several letters from William

 

Johnston, another leading patriot in N.C., to
Williams is dated April, 1775. Johnston wrote
Williams about an unidentified incident and the
procurement of powder and provisions for the

Colonial forces.

 
Williams, John 2
On June 29, 1775, James Hogg wrote Williams
concerning the vcroceedings of an assembly, pos-
sibly the assembly of the area being settled
by the Louisa Company, later the Transylvania
Company, in which Richard Henderson, and
Nathaniel and Thomas Hart, joined Hogg and
Williams to further the settlement of the
Transylvania area. Nathaniel Henderson, a

 

partner of his brother Richard, wrote Williams
on Oct. 5, 1775, asking Williams to come to
Transylvania to help settle some of the disputes

 
Williams, John . 3
over land titles. He discussed the promising
future of the area, the interest James Harrod
showed in settling there, and the election of
Richard Henderson and Williams to represent the
area at the Continental Congress. William
Johnston wrote Williams while Williams was in
Transylvania and advised him about the granting

 

of land deeds and titles in the area (Jan. 16,
1776).

dn Feb. 14, 1776, Bromfield Ridley wrote
Williams to inform him of the raising of troops
in N.c. and the plan to prevent the Tories from

 
Williams, John 4
joining the British governor in N.C.

Wm. Johnston sent Williams a note on July 5,
1776, to inform him of a meeting of the Transyl
vania Company at Oxford, N.C. In a letter dated
Nov. 19, 1776, John Luttrell urged Williams to
consider taking new partners into the land com-
pany venture. He felt that Samuel Johnston and
Richard Caswell would be of much assistance in
pressing the claims of N.C. for. land already
being claimed by Va.

Johnston wrote Williams about financial mat-
ters on Dec. 21, 1776. The new partners had

 

 
Williams, John

been accepted into the company, but their money
was exhausted, and Johnston was forced to use
Williams’ funds to pay a bill.

Luttrell wrote Williams on Apr. 1, 1778, to
express his approval of the company's determin-
ation to approach Abner Nash to represent it at
the trial at Williamsburg in which the company
lost its land claims to the area considered a
part of Virginia. Luttrell informed him that
Williams had been chosen to represent Granvélle
in the state assembly. He hoped that Williams

could Keep a Mr. Parsons out of any further

 

 
Williams, John 6
political activity in the county.

William Johnston wrote Williams on Apr. 13,
1778, that William Dry wanted to purchase an
interest in the company.

On May 17, 1779, Charles Bondfield of Eden-
ton, N.C., asked Williams to allow him to be
among the next party to go to Transylvania.

(continued on next card)

 

 
Williams, John if 6a.

Richard Henderson, the leading figure in the
company's activities, urged Williams in a let-
ter of Sept. 13, 1779, to use his influence to
get satisfactory action on land titles by the
N.C. Assembly. Henderson criticized the
Virginia legislature for its activity in land
disputes and expressed the hope that N.C.
would not also

(continued on next card)

 

 
Williams, John 7
act unjustly. In an undated fragment of a let-
ter from Henderson to John Williams, Jr.,
Henderson discussed matters concerning their
law partnership.

Other items in this collection include a
receipt signed by Williams (Nov. 6, 1786) and
written on the reverse side of a letter certi-

 

fying Williams" attendance at the Nov. term of
the supérior court at Edenton, and a letter from
James Steohens to J. Williams, Jr. during the
younger Williams’ serviee as Clerk of Superior

 
Williams, John 8
Court, Surry County, N.C. There is also a
printed indenture conveying land in Transylvania
to Henderson, Hart, Hogg, Williams, et al.

(1775).

 

1 item added, 9-13-66: An undated letter
from William Hooper to Williams. Hooper

This is a collection of mimeographed letters
from S. Rutherfoord Harvie of Danville, Va., to
"Dear Folks." His relationship to Mr. and Mrs.
John W. Williams is not revealed in the corres-
pondence, Mr. Williams was associated with

American Suppliers, a division of American
Tobacco. Reports on relatives, friends, social
events, and church affairs, with a slight bit
of information of a political nature, fill the

letters.

 
Williams, John W.

In the last paragraph of the letter of
Dec. 1, 1962, Harvie quotes from a letter
Governor Ross Barnett of Miss. had written to
him in response to his congratulating him on
“defying that Kennedy bunch up in Washington.’
The visit of John D. Rockefeller, IV, with
Molly Notting is mentioned on Feb. 1, 1963.

These are primarily the letters of John
Wesley Williams, C. S. A. soldier, to his father,
F, H. Williams, until his death in 1862, and to
his mother, Mrs. Marium Williams. Included also
are letters to and from his parents, brothers,

and sisters, and cousins in the Thomas family.
His father was evidently a farmer of Onslow
Co., N. C.

, The letters are of little value. J. W.
Williams was stationed in various camps at
Raleigh, New Bern, “oe N. C.,; and in the

area of Petersburg, Va. He makes the usual
comments on cap life, food, health, preaching
in camp (and at home), and the weather. A let-
ter of Jan. 22, 1862 describes the conditions
in New Bern. Brief comments are made through-
out to skirmishes of no importance. During 1862

 

he was concerned about getting a substitute
and the cost of such.

He died Oct. 27, 1862 of pneumonia in Va.

Matthew J. Williams was appointed from Georgia
in 1821 to the U. S. Military Academy at West
Point and graduated on July 1, 1825, under the
name of Matthew R. T. Harrison. In his diary he
mentions his stepfather, who had remarried after

his mother's death, several times, but not by
name. There is no evidence in the diary as to
why he changed his name at some point in his
life. On February 10, 1852, he did quote a

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett
compliment from Dr. A. B. Bache about the
agreeable personality and mathematical talent
he had displayed at West Point as "Mat Harrison."
See List of Cadets Admitted into the United
States es Military Academy (1902).

Williams was promoted upon graduation to

 

 

 

second lieutenant in the Artillery and sent to
the Artillery School for Practice at Fort Monroe.
From there he was transferred to the Infantry,
where he served one and one-half years before
resigning. Presumably he then studied law since

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett me
from 1829 to 1835 he was a counselor-at-law in
Lawrenceville, Georgia. .While in that state he
served as a major in the militia and as a member
of the 1833 Convention for Remodeling the Consti-
tution of Georgia. In 1835 he became a teacher
in the high school in Cokesbury, South Carolina,
and from 1840 to 1846 he served as its principal.
From 1846 until late in October, 1853, when he
left because of ill health, Williams was pro-
fessor of mathematics, natural philosophy, and
astronomy at South Carolina College, later the .

 

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett 4

 

University of South Carolina. He was president
of the Board of Visitors of the U. S. Military
Academy in 1850. He died in Marietta, Georgia,
on June 23, 1873, at the age of sixty-eight.

Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy ...,

 

 

 

 

Volume 1, or The Centennial of the United States
Military Academy at West Point, 1802-1902, Vol.
TI (1904). _

The items consist of a bill of 1858 for
merchandise Williams had purchased in Marietta

 

 

 

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett 5
from Edward Denmead, deeds for two lots of land
in Marietta that he bought from Norman L. Chester
his physician brother-in-law, in 1855 and 1861,
and the verses of two songs on the same sheet
that celebrate the month of May.

The earliest volume is a commonplace book,

 

containing several pages of accounts of Pro-
fessor Williams dating from October 9, 1847, to
October 19, 1849, and thirty-eight and a fraction
pages of the names and addresses of people to
whom he wrote letters between November 16, 1864,

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett

 

and December 29, 1868. This correspondence
record and frequent mention in his diary of
writing letters reveal that he kept in frequent
touch with many relatives and friends.

The first volume of the two-volume diary for
1851-1852 and 1852-1853 opens on October 7,
1851, with a welcoming address to the students

at the beginning of the term on October 7, 1851,
at South Carolina College. He was substituting
for President William C. Preston, who was ill.
William does not often mention his wife and

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett 7

 

children. The Williamses had a daughter Fannie
and son Henry. He mentions Henry a number of
times, though, once expressing concern whether
he was pursuing the study of law as he should be.

In 1851, Williams expressed his opposition to
secession by voting for the anti-secession
candidates for the Southern Congress that was
assembled to debate the issue. He served as
regent of the "Lunatic Asylum" in Columbia, and
in recording on October 2, 1852, a meeting of
the regents he stated that he thought their

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett 8
manner of deciding alleged insanity cases was
"often hasty and inconsiderate." He was appoint-
ed in 1852 to the commission for public buildings
in South Carolina and specifically for the "fire-
proof" building.

Williams was eclectic in his reading and in

 

his church attendance, although while in Columbia
he was a member of the Washington Street Method-
ist Church. He was a deeply religious man and

a serious reader. The friends he mentioned in
his diary were frequently ministers of different

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett 9

 

persuasions and physicians. He attended church
frequently, sometimes going to a church of one
denomination on Sunday morning and to one of
another faith on Sunday afternoon. He sometimes
gave the text of a sermon, always expressed his
opinion of it, and he often described the
minister's style of delivery whether he liked it
Or not. He also often gave his opinion of the
people whom he met in his travels, recorded his
opinion of his colleagues at South Carolina
College, and sometimes gave a low opinion of the

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett 10°

 

state's legislators. After Professor Francis
Lieber had critized him sharply in a faculty
meeting for the stand he had taken about the
discipling of a student, he expanded upon an
evaluation of Lieber he ahd recorded earlier,
and the evaluations were far from favorable.
Professor Maximilian La Borde was his neighbor,

and it appears that he was perhaps one of his

closest friends. For awhile after the Reverend
James Henley Thornwell became president of South
Carolina College, Williams was quite critical of

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett
his addresses and sermons, but later he had only
praise of him.

From Williams' diary one gets a glimpse of
the routine of life at the College, such as early
morning and evening prayers, his teaching and
managing the observatory and telescope, and the
examining of students by the faculty at the
beginning and ending of terms. A few times he
recorded being bored with teaching and his other
duties at the College. Often he mentioned being
not well in some respect. A number of times he

 

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett LZ
recorded the misconduct of students including
two minor rebellions.

As soon as the College closed for the summer
in 1851 and 1852, Williams, his wife, and possi-
bly his daugher started south to visit relatives
and friends in Cokesbury and Georgia. At least

 

the second summer Fannie met them in Cokesbury
when they returned; Henry had already left home.
The hardships they experienced in rail and
stagecoach traveling in those days are described
in some detail. Mrs. Williams' father, J. Davant,

was

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett LS
a planter near Penfield, Georgia. Williams
mentions his servants, but their number is never
given. On October 11, 1853, he bought a Negro
boy from a slave trader.

On August 10, 1853, Williams recorded his
visit to the Georgia Military Institute in
Marietta. On September 3-6, 1853, he recorded

 

his low opinion of Mercer University and of
several of its professors.

Late in August, 1853, while visiting relatives
in Lawrenceville, Georgia, Williams suffered an

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett 14

 

attack that blurred his vision, which was
already defective, and gave him severe headaches
that seem maybe to have been constant until he
gave up teaching, upon the advice of his phy-
Sician and urging of his colleagues, on October
26, 1853. He left Columbia immediately for

Marietta. His diary ends there on November 13.
Accounts for lumber purchased in 1853 and 1854
follow the last diary entry, as does a copy of a
letter of June 16, 1851, that Williams wrote to
William C. Preston, then president of South

 
Williams, Matthew Jouett H ie
Carolina College. He urged, since Preston had
not met with the faculty that morning, presumably
because of ill health, that he not attend the
examination of students that afternoon. He went
on to describe the way in which some of the
professors conducted an examination.

Williams died on June 23, 1873, aged sixty-
eight.

Nathaniel Williams, ship captain, was the
apparent owner of this volume that was used
as both an account book and a letter book.
His accounts and letters appear throughout

the period, 1758-1768, while those for other
individuals and companies are sporadic.

According to the letter of Oct. 30, 1763, he
was a resident of Boston, Massachusetts, for

 
Williams, Nathaniel

 

he noted the arrival of his wife there in

1762 and the birth of a son in 1763. This
letter also has information about Mrs.
Williams's father. Williams was the master

of a number of ships whose commercial voyages
were recorded in the volume. Usually he was
responsible for goods that belonged to various
Boston merchants, but the accounts include
merchandise that was his investment. There
may be some relationship between Williams and
Perquimans County, North Carolina. The volume

 
Williams, Nathaniel 3

 

was used from 1808 to 1534 by Jonn Wood,
clerk of that county's court. Williams had
considerable business dealings at Hertford
and other ports in North Carolina.

The correspondence, 1762-1768, and the
accounts, 1758-1768, record in detail the
commercial transactions of a series of ships

that traded with North America, Europe, and
the West Indies. Ports of call are recorded
in the following places: North Carolina,
Massachusetts, Ireland, England, Gibraltar,

 
Nathaniel

 

Spain, Portugal, Fayal in the Azores, Cuba,
and New Providence in the Bahamas. North
Carolina is prominent in the accounts -
especially Hertford and other places in
Perquimans County. Edenton, Bacon Island,
and Cape Lookout also appear. The accounts
itemize the goods shipped and also the

expenses of the voyages. The expenses reveal
the wages payed to members of the crews.

The correspondence includes comment on local
and general business conditions as well as

the specifics of transactions. The addressees

 
5

 

are usually merchants at the various ports of
call. The Boston merchants included John
Scollay, John Melville, Joseph Barrell, John
Erving, Jr., and James Perkins. Several ship
captains associated with Williams and/or the
Boston merchants also appear in the accounts
and correspondence.

John Wood, clerk of the court in
Perquimans County, used five pages of the
volume to register the cattle marks of
various persons, 1808-1834. Information

about John Wood appears in Ellen Goode

Robert Gray Williams (1878-1946), lawyer,
was born in Leesburg, Virginia. His parents
were John James and Emilie (Gray) Williams. He
received his education at Shenandoah Valley Acad
emy in Winchester, the University of Virginia,

and Roanoke College, Virginia, where he obtained
the LL.D. degree in 1932. Williams was twice
married, first to Elizabeth King in 1900 and
then to Hilda B. Dean in 1940. In addition to

 
Williams, Robert Gray 2
his law practice in Winchester, he was city
solicitor there for twelve years. He was presi
dent and/or counsel for various companies, such
as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company and
the Shenandoah Valley National Bank. Williams
served his alma mater, the University of
Virginia, as trustee of the Alumni Fund in 1923,
member of the Board of Visitors, and rector.
Various clubs and organizations, including the
National Press Club and the American Bar Associ-
ation, claimed his membership.

 

 
Williams, Robert Gray 3

The correspondence includes a letter in 1921
from Junius E. West requesting support as can-
didate for lieutenant governor of Virginia in
an election which he won. A mimeographed lette
from the Rodney Birch Research Associates to
the Committee on Finance, U. S. Senate, advo-
cated a plan for world peace. A copy was also
sent to chain representatives of about 300 smal
town newspapers.

Since Williams was the attorney for Harry
Flood Byrd, there are papers relating to him in

 

 
Williams, Robert Gray 4
this collection. Two letters concern stocks
and bonds issued by H. F. Byrd and T. B. Byrd,
Incorporated. In the financial papers are a
receipt for charter and recording fees for that
company, and a handwritten note giving the pur-
poses and officers of the Byrd Orchard Corpora-
tion as well as the value of the orchards and

 

and Turkey Knob, Deeds, 1919-1940, in the

legal papers record transactions made by Byrd.
Most of the collection consists of legal

papers, 1856-1940. Primarily deeds, indentures,

 
Williams, Robert Gray a
and wills from Virginia have been retained.
There is one stock certificate in 1908.

The miscellany includes a plat for "Waverly"
near Winchester; a map of "Hackwood"; "Report
Upon Water Supply and Purification, Winchester,
Virginia"; and "General Rules and Regulations
Under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939." The

 

blindness of Charles B. Rouss, merchant and
philanthropist, and an address by John Warwick
Daniel at the unveiling of a statue of Robert E.
Lee at Washington and Lee University are the

 
Williams, Robert Gray 6
subjects of the two clippings in the collection.
A copy of a broadside in 1921, which was

used by Junius E. West in his campaign for
lieutenant governor, is in the printed material.
Other broadsides concern the Florence Railroad
and Improvement Company, and the Hagerstown
Manufacturing, Mining and Land Improvement
Company. The pamphlets and leaflets contain
items written by Gus W. Dyer and Remmie L,
Arnold, as well as pamphlets for the 1930's
concerning the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad

 

 
Williams, Robert Gray 7

Company, the Shenandoah Valley Academy, the Cur-
tis Publishing Company, Virginia laws, and the
Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933. There is a pho-

tograph of the Prince William Hotel in Manassas,
Virginia.
