These documents supplement those in the Lib-

giving caption and dates of passage and approval

 

of all acts passed by both, Provisional and per-

because of the light they throw upon Confederate
finances and appropriations, Two warrants were
issued to donfederate agents abroad (viz. Colin
J. McRae, Ambrose Dudley Mann, and John Slidell)
Another was issued to the paymaster of a block-
ade runner for payment of salaries and expenses,
Another was issued to Columbus Upson ff salaries

made out to Judah Philip Benjamin, Sec. of State

ently the evacuation of Richmond, there are sev-
en sight drafts, dated March 23, 1865, made out
to deputies, and totalling $5, 278,462. This
was done obviously with a view to taking the
notes on hand to some other part of the country.

Taken altogether, these documents furnish re-
vealing glimpses into Confederate finances and
diplomacy and offer a possible clue to new light
on what became of the Confederate treasury after

the debacle,

arms and supplies through the blockade or
avoid it entirely.
One of the Southern agents who figures

prominently in the volume is Caleb Huse, who
operated in England and France. There is
scattered information about his activities and
his knowledge of Confederate affairs in Europe
from 1861 through 1863. On Mar. 15, 1862, he
wrote that his steps were being carefully

 

watched by U.S. agents to prevent the sending
of munitions to the Confederacy. Letters in
Jan., May and Oct., 1863, center on charges
that Huse had been dishonest in financial

matters,

The War Department documents tell of the
dealings of the Confederate government with
companies, particularly in England. These were
generally either manufacturing establishments,
such as the London Armory Company, or shipping

firms, for example S. Isaac Campbell and Com-

pany, and John Fraser and Company. The major

prensa for the companies, in addition to the
lockade, was that they did not always receive

payment when expected,

Papers and Autographs

On pages 9/-1UI are three statements, I86I-
1863, by Josiah Gorgas, Chief of Ordnance of
the C.S, Army. They concern the amount of
ordnance stores in arsenals taken from the U.S,
Army, statistics on the importation and manu-
facture of ordance and munitions of war,
and the quantity and value of army supplies
purchased by Caleb Huse. On Dec. 10, 1864,
Secretary of War James A. Seddon made a report
about exporting cotton and bringing back
supplies through the blockade. It includes

a statement of cotton run for various depart-
ments since Mar. 1, 1864,

In long letters from London dated Dec. 26,
1863, and Jan. 16, 1864, Henry Hotze wrote
discussing his view of Confederate affairs in
Europe. Hotze was a commercial agent in

 

London. In addition to discussing financial
matters of the C.S,A,, he made recommendations
that blockade-running be made a government
monopoly and that an embargo be put on cotton
exportation by private individuals.

These records, found in the federal building

at Newbern, N. C., are confined to the Confeder-
ate Court Records of the Pamlico District of N.C,
with headquarters at Goldsboro, N.C., except for
@ few papers of the U. 3. court prior to 1861 and
after 1965, The Pamlico District of N. C.appar-

 

ently included the eastern part of the State,
although only the following counties are mentiona
in the records: Orange, Wake, Harnett and Cumber-

land with Graston H.Wilder as receiver; Halifax,
Warren, Granville and Framklin with Edward Con-

Levi Scott and John Cunningham as receivers; Chat

Biggs was judge of Pamlico Bistrict.
The records are confined almost whollv to
the sequestration of alien vroperty. In general

the form of the alien vroperty lay in debts

due northern establishments by southern firms

 
C.S.A.COURT RECORDS -3~

and individuals. But in a number of cases the
form of the property was prize ships captured ~
from the North,

The records furnish a detailed account of the
debts owed to Northern firms, chiefly from retail
merchants in the Pamlico District. These various
debts, chiefly to New York and Phila, firms, were
condemned and confiscated by the Confederate gov-
ernment. Many of the records consist of question
eirres sent to the retail merchants bv Confederste

Court receivers. There are also numerous records
of the court costs of cases involving the seques-

 

 
C.S.A.COURT RECORDS ~4-
tration of alien property as well as petitions
firm people owing money to aliens and those pos-
sessing funds due to aliens.

Not all the records are so general, however.
One -» individual, Huldah Robbins of Randolph Co.
for example, stated (Jan. 24, 1862) that she had
had one bed belonging to a person in Morgan Co.,

 

Indiana, and that she sold it for $7 which she
was ready to turn over to the Confederate govt.
Often the retail merchants furnished lists of ma-

terials owned by Northern firms, some of which
were to be sold on the commission basis; such

 
C.S.A.COURT RECORDS -

items as Cherry Pectoral were included in these
lists. Patent medicines owned by NewYork and
Phila. firms constituted a large bulk of the
property sequestered by the Pamlico District
Court.

Two items of property recorded in these pa-
pers are of especial interest. One has to do
with the N.C. property of the widow of Stephen A
Douglas, Adele (Cutts) Douglas who wrote from
Washington (Nov. 19,1861) to Thomas Settle in re-

gard to an inheritance of her two sons, the in-

 

heritance presumably in Greensboro, N. ©. Ih

 
C.S.A COURT RECORDS -6-
the letter she stated that she would have to rely
on Settle, Governor Reid and Mr.Gilmer to secure
her sons' interests as well as they could. There
is also a letter (Dec. 2, 1861, Norfolk, Va) from
John Endy to Thomas Settle wherein Endy states
that he had been to Washingtm but found that Mrs.
Douglas refused to come south or to allow her
sons to come. Reverdy Johnson was her lawyer,
Theother property concerned Trinity College ’
Randolph County, N. C. A statement of Braxton

Craven (Jan. 31, 1862) shows that TrinityCollege

 

 
C.S.A.COURT RECORDS -7~

owed A. S. Barnes & Co. of N.Y. $298 due Aug.1862

and owed Chamberlain and Ritchie of Boston $100

for apparatus, According to Craven, however, Cha

berlain and Ritchie had submitted an incorrect

bill for $500 to Jonathan Worth of Asheboro, N.C,
Other items of interest ere included, particu

larly a letter of Peter Mallett, col. commanding

 

N.C.eonscripts at Camp Holmes (Aig. 19, 1863),
requesting the arrest of one Moulton who was de-
scribed as a spy and a traitor. But, in general,
these records are confined to court actions re-

garding the sequestration of alien property.

assistance, lists of hose who received assistance
and what they received, and bills and recéipts

The papers for the Congress of Industrial
Organizations (C.1I.0.) Organizing Committee of
North Carolina,with headquarters in Charlotte,
fall mainly in the 1940's and 1950's, Much of

the C,1I.0. Organizing Committee material cons
sists of the dead files of the organizing cam-
paign carried on in the state, A reorganiza-
tion. began in 1953, during which most of the
servicing and organizational work previously

conducted by the state organizing committees
was turned over to the international unions.
Therefore, in the process of shifting offices
and personnel, the files became available for
transfer to the Labor Archives at Duke Univer-
sity.

 

At the Executive Board Meeting of the Con-
gress of Industrial Organizations in March, 1946,
the C.1.0, Organizing Committee, or Southern
Organizing Committee, was established with

headquarters in Atlanta. Selected as its na-
tional director was Van A, Bittner, Vice Presi-
dent of the United Steelworkers of America, and
there were six assistant directors. There also
were State Directors for most of the twelve
states involved: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,

 

Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and
Virginia, Additional staff members were paid
organizers or field workers, many of whom were

war veterans raised in the South, and who at
one time numbered about 350.
The C.1I.0. Organizing Committee was charged
with directing the Southern Organizing Drive,
or "Operation Dixie" as it was sometimes called.

 

The American Federation of Labor also launched
an organizing drive in the South in the same
year, but it was terminated in 1947, The
Southern Organizing Drive of the Congress of
Industrial Organizations, which began on June 15

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations. .

Organizing Committee, North Carolina

 

1946, had as its basic purpose the initiation o
a campaign to organize the unorganized workers

in the twelve states of the Committee's terri-

tory as well as a portion of West Virginia. In
order to accomplish this purpose, it was neces-
sary for the field workers, after making exten-
sive contacts with workers, to file a petition

with the National Labor Relations Board for an

election to determine whether or not the union

in question would be allowed to represent the

employees in collective bargaining with the
employer. It was hoped that as a result of this
organizing effort, the workers would secure
better wages, improved working conditions, and
job security.

With its goal of obtaining one million new
members for C.1I.0. unions, the C.I.0. Organiz-
ing Committee used various methods in its work.
In addition to personal contacts with workers,
the organizers contacted professional persons,

mailings of C.I.0. material was also sent. Ex-
tensive radio and newspaper publicity was used
also,

More than one million dollars was pledged by

C.1.0. affiliates to fund the Southern Organiz-
ing Drive, The textile, lumber, chemical, and
oil industries were the ones selected for con-
centrated organizational effort, although other
businesses such as clothing manufacture, food

areas of interest. In 1953, the Organizing

The Congress of Industrial Organizations
(C.1.0.) Organizing Committee of South Carolina
centered its organizing efforts on mills in the

Piedmont area of South Carolina. Particular
cities of concentration were Anderson, Spartan-
burg, and Greenville.

Much of the C.1I.0. Organizing Committee ma-
terial consists of the dead files of the

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations.
Organizing Committee, South Carolina
organizing campaign carried on in the state. A
reorganization began in 1953, during which most
of the servicing and organizational work pre-
viously conducted by the state organizing com-
mittees was turned over to the international

 

unions. Therefore, in the process of shifting
offices and personnel, the files became avail-
able for transfer to the Labor Archives at

Duke University.

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations.
Organizing Committee. South Carolina

At the Executive Board Meeting of the Con-
gress of Industrial Organizations in March,
1946, the C.1.0. Organizing Committee, or South-
ern Organizing Committee, was established with
headquarters in Atlanta, Selected as its na-

 

tional director was Van A, Bittner, Vice Presi-
dent of the United Steelworkers of America, and
there were six assistant directors. There also
were State Directors for most of the twelve
states involved: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations.

Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Texas, and Virginia. Additional staff members
were paid organizers or field workers, many of
whom were war veterans raised in the South, and

 

who at one time numbered about 350.

The C.1.0. Organizing Committee was charged
with directing the Southern Organizing Drive
or "Operation Dixie" as it was sometimes called.
The American Federation of Labor also launched

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations.
Organizing Committee. South Carolina

an organizing drive in the South in the same
year, but it was terminated in 1947, The
Southern Organizing Drive of the Congress of
Industrial Organizations, which began on June
15, 1946, had as its basic purpose the initia-

 

tion of a campaign to organize the unorganized
workers in the twelve states of the Committee's

territory as well as a portion of West Virginia.
In order to accomplish this purpose, it was

necessary for the field workers, after making

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations.

Organizing Committee, South Carolina

extensive contacts with workers, to file a peti-
tion with the National Labor Relations Board

for an election to determine whether on not the

union in question would be allowed to represent

the employees in collective bargaining with the

 

employer. It was hoped that as a result of this
organizing effort, the workers would secure
better wages, improved working conditions, and

job security.

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations,
Organizing Committee. South Carolina

With its goal of obtaining one million new
members for C.1I.0. unions, the C.1I.0, Organizing
Committee used various methods in its work, In
addition to personal contacts with workers, the
organizers contacted professional persons, em-

 

phasizing church people, to whom periodic mail-
ings of C.I.0. material was also sent. Exten-
sive radio and enepore: publicity was used also

More than one million dollars was pledged by
C.1.0. affiliates to fund the Southern

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations,

Organizing Committee, South Carolina

Organizing Drive. The textile, lumber, chemical
and oil industries were the ones selected for
concentrated organizational effort, although
other businesses such as clothing manufacture,
food and tobacco,.furniture, and steel were

 

also areas of interest. In 1953, the Organiz-
ing Committee was abolished, having fallen far
short of its original objective.

The C,1.0. Organizing Committee of South
Carolina files are primarily the correspondence

of Franz E, Daniel and Lloyd P. Vaughan. Danie
was the South Carolina Director of the C.I.0O.
Organizing Committee from ca. May, 1946 to Aug.
14, 1950. During a portion of this same period,

 

from 1946 to ca. Sept., 1949, he also served as

South Carolina State Director of the Textile
Workers Union of America (T.W.U.A.). In 1950,
Daniel served as Secretary of the South Caroli-

na C.1.0.-Political Action Committee. Daniel's
letters appear throughout the collection, but

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations. 10

in particular there are several folders of staff
correspondence with him, During the tenure of
Daniel as Director, the office of the C.I.0.
Organizing Committee of South Carolina was
located in Spartanburg.

 

When Daniel moved north in 1950 to assume the
post as North Carolina Director of the C.1.0.,
Vaughan became the South Carolina Director of
the C.1.0. Organizing Committee, At this time
the office of the Organizing Committee was

moved to Columbia, where Vaughan resided. It
was customary for the headquarters of such org-
anizations to be moved to the city where the
person holding the position lived. Vaughan re-
tained this post at least until 1953. His other

 

experience included being C.1I.0. Area Director
for Southwest Virginia and Secretary-Treasurer
of the Virginia C.1I.0. Council.

The C.1.0. Organizing Committee of South
Carolina Papers are heavily oriented toward the
Textile Workers Union of America since textiles
is the only. industry which the C.1.0. made a
strong attempt to organize in the state. There

 

is material on the organizing efforts of this
union not only in the T.W.U.A. folders, but also
in several others that are listed in the sub-
ject file. Also, the folders containing Franz
E. Daniel correspondence as T.W.U.A. State

Director bear upon this topic. Since he held
the above-mentioned position as well as that of
South Carolina Director of the C.1I.0. Organiz-
ing Committee simultaneously, and the corres-
pondence is intermixed in the files, the mater-

ial for the two organizations has been retained
together in one collection. Some of the other
major labor unions represented are the Amalga-
mated Clothing Workers of America; the Inter-
national Woodworkers of America; the United

both in C.1I.0. and T.W.U.A. organizing efforts.
These fliers and leaflets were usually distri-

organizers contacted professional persons,
emphasizing church people, to whom periodic

tensive radio and newspaper publicity was used
also.

More than one million dollars was pledged by

C.1.0. affiliates to fund the Southern Organiz-
ing Drive. The textile, lumber, chemical, and
oil industries were the ones selected for con-
centrated organizational effort, although other
businesses such as clothing manufacture, food

and tobacco, furniture, and steel were also
areas of interest. In 1953, the Organizing Com-
mittee was abolished, having fallen far short of
its original objective,

The organizing effort of the C.1I.0. in Ten-
nessee was managed by Paul Revere Christopher,
Director of the C.1I.0. Organizing Committee in
Tennessee, The records in this collection are
primarily the files of Christopher (1910-1974),
who was born in Easley, South Carolina, the son
of a textile worker. Although Christopher

became a mill worker at the age of fourteen, he
later graduated from Clemson College in 1932,
In that same year he married Mary Elizabeth
Lybrand, and they had two children,
Christopher's career as a labor union leader
began in 1933, when he became an organizer for
the United Textile Workers of America, Four
years later he became associated with the Tex-
tile Workers Organizing Committee and then
assumed the vice presidency of the Textile Work-
ers Union of America whm it was chartered in

- During the time that he was the C,1I.0.
Director for Tennessee (1940-1955), Christopher
supervised the organizing efforts in the state.
He and his staff were responsible for a drama-
tic increase in the number of union members in
the state. In 1955, he was appointed Director
of Region VIII (Tennessee) for the A.F.L.-C.1.0.
His labor union involvement also included serv-
ing as President and Executive Secretary-
Treasurer of the Tennessee State Industrial
Union Council and as Vice President of the

Regional Directors and C.I.0. representatives
of various unions in Tennessee, In addition

there are folders for various C.I.0. represen-

Christopher maintained correspondence files
with prominent C,1I.0. officials as well as with
other trade union leaders. George Baldanzi,
Philip Murray, Lucy Randolph Mason, John V.
Riffe, Sherman Dalrymple, and Van A, Bittner
are all represented in the papers. There are

 

also folders for Allan S. Haywood, William J.

P. Priest, and Pat Sutton. Other prominent
figures represented in the collection are Harry
Emerson Fosdick, Senator Arthur Thomas Stewart,
Howard Kester, and Cameron P, Hall.

The organizing records of numerous labor
unions appear in the collection. It was evi-

dently the intent of the leaders of the C.1.0.
Organizing Committee in Tennessee to concen-
trate their efforts particularly in the steel
and textile industries, The sections for both
the United Steelworkers of America and the

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations, 18
Organizing Committee, Tennessee

Textile Workers Union of America (T.W.U.A.)

are large, containing folders for various
Tennessee companies that the appropriate union
was attempting to organize.

The several folders for the Standard-Coosa-
Thatcher Company of Chattanooga indicate the

 

extent of the T.W.U.A.'s organizing drive there.
Included in the T.W.U.A. section is some corres-
pondence of Joseph R. White, Vice President and

Director of the Tennessee T.W.U.A., and Herbert

S. Williams, Alabama Director of the T.W.U.A.

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations. 19
Organizing Committee, Tennessee
Some of the T.W.U.A. files were evidently ori-
ginally those of Joel B. Leighton, a National
R:epresentative and then an International Repre-
sentative of the union, which later were sent to
the main office in Knoxville.

At the end of the T.W.U.A. section are three

 

 

card file boxes containing various types of
records of the union, One box is filled with
union membership cards for employees of Stan-
dard-Coosa-Thatcher Company; Gluck Brothers,
Inc; Tennessee Furniture Industries, Inc; and

Morrison ten Company. Contact cards for
workers in the Standard-Coosa-Thatcher Company
are in another box. Dues records for Chatta-
nooga and the contiguous Northwest Georgia
pee comprise the contents of the third card
file,

Although the C.1I.0. Organizing Committee
apparently stressed the textile and steel indus-
tries, much organizing effort was also produced
by the United Furniture Workers of America
and the United Gas, Coke, and Chemical Workers

of America. The collection contains large sec-
tions for each of these unions. The Gas, Coke,
and Chemical Workers material includes the Oak
Ridge, Tennessee, organizing drive, since the
Atomic Workers Organizing Committee was a divi-

These papers for the Congress of Industrial
Organizations' -(C,I.0.) Organizing Committee in
Virginia, headauartered in Richmond, primarily

consist... of the dead files of the organizing
campaign carried on in the state, A reorganiza-
tion began in 1953, during which most of the
servicing and organizational work previously con
ducted by the state organizing committees was

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations.

turned over to the international unions, There-
fore, in the process of shifting offices and
personnel, the files became available for trans-
fer to the Labor Archives at Duke University.

At the Executive Board Meeting of the Con-

 

gress of Industrial Organizations in March,
1946, the C.I.0. Organizing Committee, or
Southern Organizing Committee, was established
with headquarters in Atlanta. Selected as its
national director was Van A, Bittner, Vice

President of the United Steelworkers of America,
and there were six assistant directors, There
also were State Directors for most of the

twleve states involved: Alabama, Arkansas, Flor-
ida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,

 

North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Texas, and Virginia. Additional staff members
were paid organizers or field workers, many of
whom were war veterans raised in the South, and
who at one time numbered about 350.

The C.I.0,. Organizing Committee was charged
with directing the Southern Organizing Drive, or
"Operation Dixie" as it was sometimes called,
The American Federation of Labor also launched
an organizing drive in the South in the same
year, but it was terminated in 1947. The South-

 

ern Organizing Drive of the Congress of Indus-
trial Organizations, which began on June 15,
1946, had as its basic purpose the initiation of
a campaign to organize the unorganized workers

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations.

in the twelve states of the Committee's terri-
tory as well as a portion of West Virginia. In
order to accomplish this purpose, it was neces-
sary for the field workers, after making exten-
sive contacts with workers, to file a petition

with the National Labor Relations Board for an
election to determine whether or not the union
in question would be allowed to represent the
employees in collective bargaining with the
employer. It was hoped that as a result of this

organizing effort, the workers would secure
better wages, improved working conditions, and
job security.

With its goal of obtaining one million new
members for C.1.0. unions, the C.1I.0. Organizing

Committee used various methods in its work, In
addition to personal contacts with workers, the
organizers contacted professional persons,empha-
sizing church people, to whom periodic mailings
of C.I.0. material was also sent, Extensive

radio and newspaper publicity was used also,
More than one million dollars was pledged by
C.1.0. affiliates to fund the Southern Organiz-
ing Drive. The textile, lumber, chemical, and
oil industries were the ones selected for con-

centrated organizational effort, although other
businesses such as clothing manufacture, food
and tobacco, furniture, and steel were also
areas of interest. In 1953, the Organizing Com-
mittee was abolished, having fallen far short of

its original objective.

The Virginia State Director of the C.I1.0.
Organizing Committee was Ernest (Mike) Byron
Pugh, whose files comprise the bulk of this col-
lection. Born in Norfolk, Virginia in 1880, the

son of a sea captain, Pugh attended college for
two years. In 1939, he married Georgia P.
Provens and has a child by a former marriage.

A member of the International Woodworkers of
America, he served in various capacities within

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations,

the labor union movement. He has been General
Chairman of the Machinists C and O Railroad, a
General Organizer for the A.F.L. in West Virgin-
ia, Chicago Regional Director for the C.I.0., as
well as Virginia Director of the Paper Workers

Organizing Committee. In 1941, Pugh became
Regional Director for the Virginia C.I.0., and
when the C,I.0. Organizing Committee was formed,
he was named Virginia Director. He was later
named Assistant Director of Region IV of the

Pugh was assisted in the organizing effort
by Theodore (Ted) Dennis du Cuennois, the Assis

York City. Sidney Hillman hed been the chair-
man, but upon his death in 1946, Jack Kroll was
named Director, with his office in Washington,
D.C. The Political Action Committee aspired to
be, as one C.1I.0. publication put it, "the
spearhead of the progressive political move-
ment of America." The two-fold purpose of

the Committee was to promote the C.I.0. view-
point on political issues, as well as to advo-
cate registration and voting both in local and

national elections. To implement these

goals the Political Action Committee pushed pro-
gressive legislation in areas such as minimum
wage, housing, social security, veterans bene-
fits, and full employment, The organization
also endorsed and worked for the election of
liberal candidates likely to favor pro-labor

legislation. Publications of the Committee in-
clude pamphlets, posters, leaflets, and the

The structure developed over the years to
fulfill the purposes and carry on the activities
of the Political Action Committee (PAC), includ-
ed an executive board, The jnternational unions
also appointed PAC Committees, Directors, and

 

liaison. representatives. In 1945, the C.I1.0.
Executive Board decided that the industrial
union council in each state should establish a
political action committee, to be supervised by
the national PAC. These state organizations

were complete within the year. Financing for
the PAC came almost entirely from contributions ¢
of members of unions affiliated with the C.I1.0.

primarily that of Charles C, Webber, who was

elected President and Director of the Virginia
C.1.0. Political Action Committee in 1946. He
was born in 1892, in Osborne Mills, near Ann

Arbor, Michigan. A graduate of the University

of the Denver Labor College. In 1946, he became
President of the Virginia State Industrial Unio

The Congress of Industrial Organizations
(C.I1.0.). Publicity Department. North Carolina
is a subsidiary organization to the national

C.1I.0. Publicity Department. The national org-
anization was responsible for the press and
public relations functions of C.1.0. work, as
evidenced by its listing in the President of
the C.I.0.'s yearly reports. Keeping C.1.0.

members and the general public informed about
activities of the C,1I.0. and affiliated unions
was the major purpose of the Publicity Depart-
ment. To implement this purpose, the Department

employed various techniques, such as radio pro-

grams, circulation of C.I.0. pamphlets, and use
of the C,I.0. press as well as the general press

magazine articles, it was involved with the
Union News Service, a weekly clipsheet; The CIO

News, the official weekly publication of the
C.1.0.; and the Labor Press Association, For
the first time in 1952 the C.1.0. initiated
broadcasts over television.

Over the years the specific thrust of the
C.I.0, Publicity Department changed depending

primarily on pressures upon it from the outside.
In 1946, the main emphasis was on countering an
anti-union drive, but by 1949, the Publicity
Department stressed a campaign to repeal the

 
Congress of Industrial Organizations.

Taft-Hartley Act and the need for an expanded
political action program, The years 1951 and
1952 saw an effort by the Department to counter
anti-labor propaganda
the C.1I.0. of having

: which, in part, accused
'socialist" objectives.
Personnel both in the national and the North
Carolina Publicity Departments changed during
the years covered by this collection. The
national Directors of the Publicity Department
were Len De Caux in 1946; followed by Allan L.
