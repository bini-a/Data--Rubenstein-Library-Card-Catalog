Papers, 1859

Section A

Durham, W. J. Hugh. Papers. Orange Co., N.C.

 

The Durham and Snipes families of Orange
County lived west of Chapel Hill. Little is
known about their history. A member of the
group was Dr. Bartlett Leonidas Durham, who gave
the land which brought the North Carolina
Central Railroad through Durham's Station.

The letter forming this collection is from a
young man, W. J. H. Durham, attending Jefferson
Medical College in Philadelphia in 1859. It is
directed to his brother, unnamed at "Riggsbees,"

 
Durham, W. J. Hugh ra
but sent to Chapel Hill to expedite delivery.
In it Hugh [?] Durham refers to the death of
Bartlett Leonidas Durham and to the marriage of
a Sister, S. P. Durham.

The Southern Business Directory names in 1854
Durham and Borland at White Cross, Orange
County, and Durham and Angier at Prattsburg,

 

 

Orange County, trading as merchants. This is
probably Dr. Bartlett Durham.

In 1867-1868, Branson's North Carolina
Business Directory lists Dr. Hugh Durham at

 

 

 
Durham, W. J. Hugh

 

Durham's. He continued in practice there as
late as 1872, but his name does not appear in
the 1877 directory. However, Hiram Voss Paul
lists Dr. W. J. H. Durham in 1884, and his name
appears in 1897 in Branson's Directory.

This collection consists of personal corres-
pondence among three young men. It is not clea
whether they were old enough to have been Con-
federate soldiers or not. In any case the let-
ters reflect their difficulties arising from Re-
construction and the unsettled conditions, 2Z.T,
Durham aspired to be a lawyer, and began the
study of law in a half-hearted way, but did not
pursue it long. His friends with whom he cor-
responded were more successful and actually did
become lawyers. They oe” Brantly A. Denmark

 
DURHAM, Zachary Taylor, Sketch. (2)
and Arthur Howell, both of Savannah,

In 1871 Z, T. Durham was living in Choctaw
Co., Alabama, but there is no evidence of what
he was doing. In 1872 he was in Texas, to which
place he had contemplated removing for some time
He gives some description of the country. A
letter from a friend, John Snyder, written at
San Francisco in 1874, gives a rather full and
interesting description of that city, of Cali-
fornia, and of other parts of the west. The
last letter shows Arthur Howell on a vacation in
Atlanta where he was trying to recover his

health. ee

 

 
DURHAM, Zachary Taylor, Sketch, (3)
As a whole the letters serve to reflect some-
what the difficulties which young men faced dur-
ing Reconstruction. One letter comments on
southern feelings about July 4th in those years.
Z. T. Durham was a rather visionary young man
who did not succeed in achieving his ambitions.

The Durham Hosiery Mills was incorporated in
1898. It was the result of a merger of the
Durham Hosiery Company (organized in 1895) and
the Golden Belt Hosiery Company. Its early
history is recorded in William Kenneth Boyd,
The Story of Durham, City of the New South
(purham, 1927), pp. 123-127. Additional infor-
mation and statistics appear in the various
editions of Davison's Textile Blue Book and
Moody's Industrial Manual. In 1969 the company
moved to a new plant in Franklin County (Durha
Morning Herald, Feb. 13, 1969, Section B, p.l).

The paragraphs below describe first the
records of the Durham Hosiery Company and then

those of its scissile deadls the Durham Hosiery
Mills.

Durham Hosiery Company

 

This collection contains what seems to be
the complete papers of the Durham Hosiery Com-
pany while George M. Graham served as secretary

 
Durham Hosiery Mills

|and treasurer. Graham's tenure included

the organization period of the mill from

1895 to 1898, but none of the prosperous

period which followed for hosiery manufacturers
after the passage of the Dingley tariff act

in 1898. The collection contains only a

few items for 1898 and but one piece for

1899. During this period, G. P. Collins

 

 
=RHAM HM. -2- ;
served as president of the company, although his
ame appears only on letterheads in this set,

In brief the collection consists of letters,

bills and broadsides, and bourid volumes. The fo
mer are confined largely to the establishment of
he factory and the sale of goods. The bound vol
mes consist of time books, express books, let-
erbooks, records, inventories, check stubs, ac-
ounts of loopers, cash books, ledgers and stock
ertificates. Contrary to the account in Boyd's
Ptory of Durham, one of these volumes reveals

hat the a

 

 

ate of the organization of the campany

 
The papers reveal two important factors in a
very clear cut manner; the general establishment
of textile mills over the South around the turn
of the century and the dependence of these South-
ern mills on the North for equipment and sup~
plies.

Included in the evidence regarding the wide-~
spread establishment of textile mills in the South
are many indirect statements. The most outstand-
ing of such evidence is to be found in letters

eoncerning the instal lation of machinery; quite

 
DURHAM HM. —4=

oftemnasrepresentative of a manufacturer of
machinery would install knitting machines in sev=
eral factories in the general vicinity of Durham.
Letters in this collection explain such itiner~
aries and thereby yield valuable information re=-
garding the organization of other factories, Such
items, too, as a request from L, A, Lloyd of Me-

 

ridian, Mississippi, Sept. 27, 1895, asking if
certain machinery could be used by inexperienced
labor and from the Dixie Mills, Lenoir City,
Tennessee, for advice regarding the best type of

nitting machines also throw light on the estab-

 
DURHAM HM, -5-

lishment of textile mills #f fhe South. There
are direct references to the Raleigh Cotton
Millis, the Eden Park Cotton Mill of Atlanta,
The McCall Manufacturing Co. of McCall, 3S. C.,
the Eno Cotton Mills of Hillsboro, N.C., the
Mayo Mills of Mayodan, N.C., the Clover Cotton
Manufacturing Co. of Clover, S.C., and the Kerr

 

Thread Company of Atlanta. An interesting fac-
tor apparent on the letterhead of the Mayodan
Mills is that the directors were men who had ob-
tained capital from the tobacco business as

B. N. Duke, R. H. Ricks, and G. W. Watts.

 
DURHAM H.M, -6—
By far the greater part of this collection
has todo with the purchase of supplies and
equipment. Among firms from which supplies and
equipment were obtained are the Franklinsyille
Dye Works of Philadelphia, the Excelsior Needle
Companypf Torrington, Conn., the Providence
Knitting Machine Company of Rhode Island, the
Champion Sewing Machine Company of Philadel-
phia, the Tonken Boile a Engine Works of
Oswego, N. Y. , the Sanford Spinning Company
of Fall River, Mass., The Foster Machine Com,

of Westfield, Maaa., the Philadelphia Textile

 

 
DURHAM H.M. -6-

Machinery Company of Philadelphia (also well
known for the manufacture of machinery for the
manufacture of tobacco), the Union Raveler

Co. and the Beattie Machine Wonks of Cohoes,
N. ¥., the Keystone Knitting Machine Co. of
Philadelphia, , the Eagle Ink Works of Phila-
delphia, George W. Payne and Col of Pawtucket,
R.I., and numerous others,

Another interesting item in the above cate-
gory is the Durham Dyeing Co. consisting of
Max Sarfert, Charles Taylor and Rudolph Kueff-
ner, evidently an offshoot of the "Fast Black

Dye Works" of Vvininey: Del., of whisgh

 

 
DURHAM -@-
Taylor and Sarfert were the officers,

Other papers of the collection reveal efforts
of Graham to secure laborers, especially ma-
chinists, dyers, and other skilled laborers
from the North. There are also many f reight
bills and letters from commission merchants
regarding the sale of hosiery, There is evi-
dence also that the Durham Hosiery M111 and the
Golden Belt Hosiery Company merged under the
name of the fdmer in or about December 1896,

About that time also the Carolina Hosiery
Co.. with headquarters in New York City, was

 

 
DURHAM -8-

organized, Julian S. Carr being president and

A, T. Bloomer, secretary. This commission firm
sold the products of Durham Hosiery Mill, Golda-
en Belt Mill, Alden Knitting Mill, and Seam-

less Hosiery U1.1 from the outset; early in 1898

they began selling for the following additional

mills; Stafford Hugenby Hosiery Co., Riverview

Knitting Mills, Hart Mfg. Co., H. Berger and
Son, and the Pelham Mills. Bloomer urged Gra=
ham to increase his output in July 1897 stating
that great benefits were to be derived from the

hosiery business because. of proposed changes in
e

the tariff bill, after arge quan

 
DURHAM H.M, -Qu

titiesof imported goods...are cleandd up." Ap-
parently, however, Graham was never able to
conquer the problems of the finishing room but
he was successful in the knitting and dyeing
departments.

The collection also includes a number of
letters which show something of the wages
earned by expert hosiery mill workers, as
well as certain records among the bound vol-
umes,

As a whole the material is repetitious, but

 

REXRRXKKE EXER

 
Durham Hosiery Mills 10
it is also valuable as a complete record of the
troubles of an inexperienced operator who orga-
nized a mill but could not operate it. It re-
veals an interesting cross section of the in-
dustrialization which began to sweep the South
after 1865.

Twenty-one volumes are the general ledgers,

1922; Mill No. 4 at Carrboro, 1909-1922; Mill
No. 6 at Durham, 1914-1921; and Mill No. 7 at
Carrboro, 1913-1922.

A ledger of 1910-1913 lacks identifying
markings. A note attached to page 176 indicates
that the book belonged to Durham Hosiery, but
the particular plant or office is still unclear.
The volume records order and shipping informa-

The volumes are listed individually at the
end of this description.

There are two letters of 1919 and 1920, the

 

former concerning the organization of the
Personnel Department. A financial statement
dates from December 31, 1962.

There are some financial statements of the

company from the 1920's and 1930's among the
papers of William Alexander Smith, a stockholder
(See the Subject File for dates).

Durham Methodist Society, Papers. Durham,
Durham Co,, N.C,

 

The Durham Methodist Society was formed as
the "City Methodist Society in Durham" on April
7, 1943, to fill a need "for a united program
for the promotion of the church and the build-

ing of the Kingdom of God" in Durham, where the
Methodist Church had experienced a lack of
growth during the preceding twenty years. The
name of the organization was changed to the

 
Durham Methodist Society,

 

ethodist Society of Durham May 6, 1943, and,
finally, to the "Durham Methodist Society" on
June 10, 1943, The society engaged in various
promotional activities, including vesper ser-
vices, and in the establishment of new church
societies in Durham,

The establishment of the society, the ac-
ceptance of its tentative organization ( a
Board of Managers, an Executive Committee, and
- four officers), and the election of officers

 
Durham Methodist Societ

ng Charles Jordan as president) are
discussed in the minutes of April 7, 1943, The
minutes of the meetings of the Executive Com-
mittee (May 20, June 7, July 13, Oct. 28, Dec.
10 and 16, 1943, and Feb, 17, 24, and 28; 1944)
and of the Board of Managers (May 6, June 10,
July 22, Sept, 2, Oct. 28, Dec, 1.” 1943, and
Feb. 17, 1944) discuss the various. activities of
the society.

Dye, Henry. Papers, 1861-1958. Plano, Collin
County, Texas

 

The papers of Dr. Henry Dye contain a few
miscellaneous items, but arecentered in his
record of cases in the C. S. A. general hospi-
tals in the District of Arkansas at Little Rock,
Washington, Camden, Lewisville, Princeton,

Tulip, and Magnolia.

Dr. Dye was a graduate of the Jefferson
Medical College in Philadelphia in 1861. His
home is listed in the Jefferson Catalogue as

 
Dye, Henry 2
Plano, Collin County, Texas, a post-village in
the Houston and Texas Central R. R., eighteen
miles north of Dallas. From his case book it is
evident he returned to Plano after the Civil War%
Interest in ?jedicine seems to be indicated by a
receipt for a cancer salve made by his grand-
father.

Mr. Dye wrote to the Rev. John Beverly on

 

August 31, 1862, from St. John's Hospital at
Little Rock. He had recently passed the exam-
ination by the medical board and was assigned to
this hospital. After mentioning health

 
Dye, Henry .

 

conditions among the Condederate troops, he des-
cribes St. John's College, whose five acres of
grounds afford a general hospital center for the
Confederate Army west of the Mississippi River.
Evidently Dr. Dve was attached to the Spy
Company of indenendent Texas cavalry under Capt.
Alfred Johnson during the first year of the war.
He refers to their camp at Brownsville, Prairie
County, and to their horses in August, 1862.
After denouncing the conduct of Union troops
towards Arkansas civilians, he describes a fight

 
-Dye, Henry 4

 

in which his company killed many Union troops
and ound them to be wearing metal breastplates,
His large book of case records begins with a
summary of health conditions among the Texas Con
federate troops during the summer of 1862 at
Crystal Hill, near the Arkansas River. Dysen-
tery, diarrhea, hospital fever, and intermittent
fever are noted.
In Nov..1862, he transformed the Rock Hotel
into a receiving hospital (p. 12); the
Dilt's Building was also made into a hospital;

 
Dye, Henry 5

and in Dec,, 1862, General Thomas E. Hindman's
army entered Little Rock bringing more hospital
patients. The Beebe House and the Hill Hospital
were next opened, as well as the Main Street
Hospital. Twenty-five hundred sick men were in
these hospitals during the winter of 1862-1863,
the death rate rising to eight per day (p. 12),
"a frightful mortality rate." With the spring of
1863, conditions improved, so that the number

of hospitals dropped from nine to three; then
all were closed except St. John's. Dr. Dve men-

 

 
Dye, Henry 6

 

tions casualties from the battle of Helena,
July, 1863, He also comments in these first
pages of his volume of treatments and medicines
used. Wounded continued to be placed in St.
John's College Hospital until the evacuation of
Little Rock by the Confederate Army.

Dr. Dye then served at Washington and
Camden, Arkansas, where the hospitals had com-
paratively light sick lists. Pneumonia,
prevalent at the beginning of 1864 (p. 13), is
described in some detail. He points out the
ruggedness of life in the cavalry in winter

 
Dye, Henry ”

 

and mentions "pneumonia weather" at Camp Sumpter}
A previous pneumonia epidemic at Camden, Arkan-
sas, in 1857 is also reported (p. 14). Then
Dr. Dye notes in detail two pneumonia cases,

On p. 15 he begins a series of notes on cases
treated at Camden Hospital during the witner
of 1863-1864, including remedies used; and in
some instances, Dr. Dye illustrated the wound in
question. Conditions noted include chronic
diarrhea, bronchitis, typhoid pneumonia, peri-
tonitis, and chronic ulcer among many cases,

 
Dye, Henry 8

On p. 24 Dr Dye details cases in the General
Hospital at Princeton, Ark., coming from the
battle of Jenkins' Ferry, April 30, 1864. These
cases are gunshot wounds, many of which received
cold water treatment. Most of the troops are
Texans. Dr. Dye digresses on p. 42 to speak
of remittant fevers in the vicinity of Prince-
ton. He then continues the gunshot wound dis-
cussion. During May, 1864, Dr. Dye operates
on a number of Federal troops and gives a sum-

mary of these cases,

 

 
Dye, Henry 9

 

On p. 46 he resumes the notes on Confederate
sick and wounded at Princeton, noting many
instances. Case 89 (p. 61) is one of typhoid
fever in a young Negro boy.

Until the cases described at Princeton,
Arkansas, the journal gives the impression of
having been written after the events and cases

it records. With the heavy increase in gunshot
wounds noted in the summer of 1864, Dr. Dye
seems to be recording the cases as they come
in, making a later comment on their progress.

- <

 
e, Henry 10
p. 60 he writes of personal happenings.
The battle of Jenkins' Ferry also sends patients
to the General Hospital at Tulip, Arkansas;
these cases are noted beginning with p. 65. Here
he finds the greatest mortality among the Arkan
sas troops and tries to discover the cause.

 

Erysipelas is prevalent. Dr. Dye explains that
he took no notes on the surgical cases at Tulip.

He writes of the asthemic (?) form of fever, of
bilious diarrhea (p. 69), and more gunshot

wounds,

 
Dve, Henry rs.

 

On Sept. 1, 1864, Dr. Dye wrote a summary
(p. 74) of types of diseases most prevalent and
their course of treatment. He discourses on
intermittent and remittent fevers, jaundice, and
a few other miscellaneous cases. On Sept. 30
and Dec. 31, 1864, he sends in quarterly reports
from Princeton and Magnolia, respectively, on

the sick and wounded (pp. 82, 86), and he com-
Piles a long general report on climate, diseases
troops, diet, water, hospitals, and spurious
vaccination. (pp. 86-91). His last report from

 
Dye, Henry 12

 

Magnolia Hospital is dated March 31, 1865.

The volume concludes for Dr. Dye with notes
on his practice at Plano, Texas, 1869-1873. Dr.
F. C. Dye, the son of Dr. Henry Dye, also prac-
tices medicine, He works at hospitals in Tyler,
Texas, and in Kennard, Houston County, in
1903-1904 (pp. 281-285).

Dr. Henry Dye records at the end of his vol-
ume (p. 668) a list of remedies from the Civil
War period. Most interesting (p. 681) is the
remedy , Grandfather Dye's Salve, a cure for can-

The papers of Pliny Earle (1809-1892), Quaker
physician and alienist, and his father, Pliny
Earle (1762-1832), Quaker inventor and s@ientist
concern their professional careers, with very
few personal letters. Pliny Earle, Sr., has

 

 

correspondence centering on his invention of
machinery for WBKimg cards for carding wool and
cotton, He was involved in the early textile
mills in Mass., and particularly in Samuel
Slater's cotton manufacturing. His correspond-
ent, Samuel Hastings, touches on patent rights,

U. S. relations with San Domingo and Great Bri-

Comment is made on the debate in Congress of the
purchase of Florida from France, the gppropra-
ation for which was in reality a gratUlhty to

 

Talleyrand for peace. On May 15, 1809,Nathaniel

Miller mentions a law suit involving carés in
cotton manufacture and Samuel Slater. Jacob
Justin and Joseph Bowne also write about cards,
In 1832 the son of Pliny Earle begins a long
correspondence, At this time a Quaker school

involves Quaker meetings in New England. Brief-
ly, Pliny Earle, Jr., secured his M, D. in 1837
from Pennsylvania, was superintendent of a nun-
ber of lunatic asylums, visited Europe in 1837-
59, 1849, and 1871, and wrote voluminouBly on
medical subjects, His papers reflect this

 

Career. Valentine Mott, George H. Green, and
Joseph Sargeant write during his first European
tour. While at the Friends' Asylum, Frankford,
Pa., Dean Robtey Dunglison and Surgeon Alexander
H. Stevens correspond, From 1845 to 1853 the
papers come while Earle was superintendent at

 
Earle, Pliny &
Bloomingdale Asylum in New York. Well known by
this time, alienists and physicians were ex-
changing reports and visits.with him from as
far afield as Edinburgh, Scotland, Nova Scotia,
Canada, and York, England. Theodoric Romeyn
Beck, James M. Barnard, and James Thurman all
write on these topics, In 1845 J. W. Edmonds

 

begins the letters from prison administrators
who consult Earle. Eliz@ .W. B. Farnham, Matron
of the Female Department at Sing Sing Prison,
writes in 1846. Gunning Bedford, Martyn Paine,

Pliny Earle wrote a brief sketch of his
father and mother in 1889. It is particularly
good on Patience (Buffum) Earle, giving a poem
by her, describing her person and personality,

 

and showing her influence in the Society of
Friends. Mrs. Earle gave poetic tribute to her
teacher, the eminent Quaker Elisha Thornton,

The papers conclude with a letter to Emma Phip-
son, English novelist, to Miss F, C. Earle, pre-
sumably Earle's daughter.

Earle, Ralph E.W. Papers, 1833. Washington,
D.C.

Six items in this collection are brief notes
from Earle's contemporaries, and contain mere
trivia. The seventh item is a printed pen
sketch of Earle himself.

Raloh E.W. Earle was a son of Ralph Earle,
(1751-1801) well-known Revolutionary War-period
artist. The elder Earle is known to have done a
portrait of Goerge III and was a member of the
Royal Academy. A Tory and a rover, Earle spent
the war years in England, but returned to Conn-

 

 
Earle, Ralph E.W. 2
ecticut in the late 1780's. Most of his paint-
ings done there are of well-known contempories.
His son, the subject of this sketch, was born
of a second marriage. Ralph E.W. Earle was an
itinerant portrait artist when he was "discov-
ered" by Rachel Jackson, about 1821, at the
"Hermitage." For the next seventeen years,

 

until his death in 1838, Earle remained a member
of the Jeckson housenold. He was referred to
during these years as "Colonel" Earle. Portraits
of this period include a number of Jackson

 
Earle, Ralph E.W. 4
family members, plus other well known contempor-
aries. Earle may have had no special inflikence
on President Jackson other than his loyal
friendship and qualities of companionability.
Earle had married a niece of Mrs. Jackson, and
had thus become a member of the clan.

The Ralph Earle papers include: a dinner

 

invitation of Jan. 12, 1833, from a "Mr. Wood-
bury" (possibly written at the request of Levi
Woodbury); an invitation from the French Ministe
in Washington (n.d.)3; other dinner invitations;

 
Earle, Ralph E.W. 4

a note from Virginia Timberlake requesting
Nashville newspapers for Mrs. Peggy Eaton (n.d.}
and a request from Charles Gratiot to attend a
card party. These communications are addressed
to Earle, in care of the "President".

Peter C. Earnhardt appears to be from Fond
du Lac County, Wisconsin. He served in the
Union Army in Virginia and West Virginia, but
he is uot listed in The History of Fond du Lac
County, Wisconsin as one of that county's

 

 

residents who joined the Army. References in
his diary, however, indicate that he was orig-
inally from that area.

The diary is mainly a daily record of the
routine activities of Earnhardt's military

experience. It was begun on June 9, 1362, and
proceeds to the end of that year and then re-
verts to the beginning of the volume to record
the first months of 1863. Earnhardt mentions
various individuals, many of whom were connect-
ed wit the Third Regiment of Wisconsin Volun-
teers, the unit to which Earnhardt was probably
attached. Runaway slaves are mentioned on
August 19, 1862.

This volume is entitled "Extracts from the
East India Company's Records, at Madras, Rela-
tive to the Conduct of the Nabob Walau Jau,
1755." It contains extracts of documents and

correspondence that concern the political and
financial relationship of Mohammed Ali, Nabob
of Arcot, with the officials of the Madras

Presidency. These documents date from 1755 to
1775, but they are principally from 1755-1770.

East India Company. India. Madras Presidency
The Nabob is closely allied with the East

India Company, which sustains his rule over the
Carnatic in southern India. He governs this
region throughout the second half of the eight-
eenth century. Not until 1801 does the com-
pany assume the administration of the Carnatic

 

and thus combine its military control and civil
administration. Because of military assistance
from the company, Mohammed Ali becomes indebted
to it, and he cedes territory and assigns reve-
nues in order to meet his financial obligations

to the British. The financial agreements and
negotiations between the Nabob and the Madras
Presidency are the principal topics of this
volume.

The contents of the volume are: Extracts
of correspondence and other documents, 1755-

17755 ppe 1-333; short calendars of the corre-
spondence and documents, pp. 35-37; and an
account of tribute owed to the Nabob by various
lesser rulers in the Carnatic, August 16, 1762,
pp. 38-44. The rest of the volume is blank.

the date and purpose for the copying of thes¢
extracts is not apparent. The text affords no
explanation, and the watermarks do not include
dates.
The correspondence and documents involve the
Nabob and the governors, the Select Committee,

 

and the Board of the Madras Presidency. The
two governors who appear prominently are George
Pigot, First Baronet and Baron Pigot (1755-
1763), and his successor, Sir Robert Palk (1763
~1767). <A few items of correspondence between

Madras and the company's authorities in England
are also represented.

The financial and political relationship of
the Nabob and Governor Palk is noted in the
sketch of Palk in the Dictionary of National
Biography. A detailed account for the years,

 

 

1763-1765, appears in James Mill, The History
of British India (London, 1820), Vol. III, pp.

First Bart. (1784-1865)

Sir John Easthope, was a banker, financier,
and railway promoter, a Whig member of Parlia-
ment, and the owner of the semi-official daily,
The Morning Chronicle. His papers (centering
Chiefly in the years 19834-1847 during his owner-
ship of the newspaper) are illustrative of the
relationship between the press and British
politicians. They also give a picture of the
interplay of personalities in the inner Whig
party circle. Most of the leading political
issues of the period oe upon fn the

 

 

 
 

Easthope, Sir John 2
letters. References to the Royal Family, parti-

Cularly to Queen Victoria, are numerous; they
indicate a royal concern about newspaper publi-
city.

The Morning Chronicle history is also re-
flected by the Easthope papers. John Black, the

 

paper's most. successful editor, employed Dickens
as a reporter and Thackeray as an art critic.
Black was a clear-headed, reforming, Scottish
Journalist, who used all the amateur and not
always helpful assistance afforded him by Whig
politicians. Brougham, Charles Buller, Joseph

 
Easthope, Sir John ts)
Parkes, and Mary Russell Mitford were among the
friends and contributors of the paper. An edi-
tor of the 014 school, Black did not always
guide the Chroniéle with the vigor John Easthope
demanded. “The Easthope papers indicate a friend
ship with the Earl of Durham, the most radical

 

 

of the Whigs. When the Chronicle and Easthope
turned more radical in 1839, some indignant
Whigs attributed this to the influence of Dur-
ham, The paper supported the Melbourne Ministry
as a semi-official organ between 1835-1841. By

1840 Easthope and the a were enthusiastic

 
Easthope, Sir John 4

 

 

supporters of Lord Palmerston and his Syrian
and French policies. A series of his letters
and a number of miscellaneous papers in the
Easthope correspondence bear this out. Eventu-
ally Easthope broke with Lord John Russell over
this support of Palmerston. (Rumor had it that

Palmerston wrote articles for the Chronicle
during the years of Peel's ministry, 1641-1846, )
John Black was summarily dismissed as edi-
tor by Easthope in 1843, Andrew Doyle, the
foreign editor of the Chronicle, had married
Easthope's daughter an ecome editor. The

The main body of the Easthope papers end

in 1847, when he sold his newspaper, which had

been losing money, to supporters of Sir Robert

Peel.

The papers are notable for a number of
series of letters by leading Whigs and reformers
Easthope was involved with the Duke of Sussex,

a@ Whig, in Masonic affairs. Lord Durhan,

A letter by Princess Charlotte, daughter of
George IV, and a proclamation by Earl Bathurst,
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, open the
papers in 1809. Bathurst is addressing Tyrolese

patriots revolting against the return of the
Tyrol to Bavaria by the Treaty of Vienna or
Schénbrunn.

urging attendance in the House of Commons as
the Reform Bill is to be considered. A number

 

of Easthope drafts of letters are contained in
the papers, the first being that of June 26,
1831, to the Duke of Sussex, in which the Duke's
liberal support and Whig loyalty are mentioned,
as are Edward Ellice, Secretary of War and chief
Whig whip, and Charles 6" Lord Glenelg, of

 
 

Easthope, Sir John 8
the Board of Control. Local Whig politics are

noted in the 1832 letters from Banbury.

John Foster, presumably a rich ironmaster
of Tewkesbury and an old friend, writes from
Stapleton on Feb. 8, 18353, commenting on parlia-
mentary reform, the "appalling" state of Ireland

with its evictions by selfish landlords, the
need to "cut back" the established church in
Ireland, the opinions of Edward Stanley, later
14th Earl of Derby, and the situation of the
Church of England. Foster's letters continue
till 1841. He comments_on the "horrid barbarian"

 
Easthope, Sir John 9
Of the populace in leoe during the Chartist
crisis.

John Easthope was for many years interested
in the affairs of Spain and Portugal, both
economic and political. He had Spanish friends,
promoted railroad building, and gave favorable

 

publicity to the liberal, constitutional parties
of the two countries in the Chronicle. An un-
dated and unsigned article, presumably for his
newspaper, is placed at the end of the papers,
and probably deals with Portugése and Spanish
politics about 1837. @ details of a subscrip-

 
Easthope, Sir John 10
tion dinner in London in April, 1534, to Juan
Alvarez y Mendizabal for his support of the
Queen Maria de Gloria of Portugal, are followed
by Mendizabal letters. Both Mendigabal and the
Duke of Sotomayor write of Spanish coal mines,
railways, and investments. e Chevalier de

 

Pirbeiro sent John Easthope his certificate of
Knighthood of the Order of Christ, which was
conferred by the apie, ny Queen on June 14,

1837, for his services to her country. Spanish
interest culminates in 1855 when Queen Isabella
appoints Sir John ““~é a Knight Commander of

 
 

Easthope, Sir John 11
the Royal Order of Charles 11. Other Spanish

correspondents are S--- Oloyaza and the Count
de Lara (1840). Easthope was interested in the
Royal North of Spain R. R.

One of the longest and most notable series
of letters to Easthope is that by Henry, Lord

Brougham, which begins on Oct. 3, 1834, and con-
tinues till Sept. 1, 1861. The two men were
good friends, though not without differences,
as seen by the group of letters in 1843 labeled
"The Brougham Affair." During this quarrel Lord
Nugent writes to calm the waters, Lord Brougham

 
Easthope, Sir John 12
chose to attack the Chronicle's reporting of a
speech by Sir Thomas Wilde. The point then
arose as to whether Easthope assumed personal
responsibility for all articles published in
the Chronicle. The forty-eight Brougham letters
are mostly political, many of them dealing with

 

Brougham's publicity in the Chronicle. In 1834
the clamor over the disselution of "church and
state," the support of general education, the
Earl of Durham, and Tory politics receive com-
ment, Easthope writes on Oct. 13, 1834, an in-
teresting letter to Brougham on French politics,

 
Easthope, Sir John 13
the dynasty of Louis Philippe, the Englieh Tor-
ies, the provisional administration of the Duke
of Wellington, and French reaction to the change
ffom Whig to Tory government, In 1839 Brougham
comments on the Corn Laws. Some details about
the "Brougham hoax" are noted in November.

 

After the quarrel of the two men in 1843, the
letters continue with political comment on
elections, Sir Robert Peel, George Canning, and
Lord Campbell. In Sept. and Oct., 1847, Brougham
writes on the crisis in money matters in the
city (London). He “~~ on Oct. 18 on Louis

 
 

Eatbthope, Sir John 14
Philippe of France as an Anglophile. The re-

signation of Palmerston as Foreign Secretary in
Dec., 1853, brings lengthy comment. Ina letter
of Sept. 1, 1854, Brougham writes of "gross
injustice" to Dr. Sidney Smith, and advocates

an appeal to Lords Palmerston and Aberdeen. He

pointedly advises no appeal to William Ewart
Gladstone, who is capable of "cruel injustice, "
and is in the hands of Sir George Otto Trevelyan
The Crimean War (1854-55) is noted, the Anglo-
French alliance favored, Leopold of Belgium seen
as not so much a Russia as he should

 
Easthope, Sir John 15
be, and dissension and jobbery in London viewed
as "disgusting. "

The second notable series of letters, corre
spondence between the Earl of Durham and East-
hope, begins in 1834 and concerns mainly Russia
and Canada. Durham, a liberal too advanced for

 

the Whig party, was sent to the British Embassy
at St. Petersburg in 1835. From there he wrote
to Easthope on Jan. 20, 1836, to keep the fires
of reform burning by not allowing the new cor-
porations (created by the Municipal Corporations
Act of 1835) to go to 6” He finds British

 
Easthope, Sir John 16

 

influence, not Russian, predominant at Con-
stantinople, and refers to the stupidity of
Lord Aberdeen, British Ambassador to Turkey.
His polities with the Tsar Nicholas I and with
the British merchants in Russia are explained.
Durham touches on reform, King William IV, the

church rates, the ballot, the House of Lords,
and Canada. Greek independence and Englani's
influence there are noted. Durham on Jan. 3,
1837, comments on the new Russian tariff giving
reduced rates and exemptions to British mer-
chants. He reports “eo I is not in-

 
x

Easthope, Sir John ae
Sane as rumored. in Apr., 1607, he denies a
rumor connecting him with Victoria's establish-
ment. In an undated letter (1838) after his
return from Russia, Durham refers to "a desper-
ate task, where my greatest obstacles arise from
the violent British." This obviously refers to

 

 

his appointment by Lord Melbourne as Governor
in Chief of Canada and head of a special high
commission to investigate and report on the dis-
turbances of that divided country. Easthope's
letter to Durham in July, 1838, speaks of his
hard task, rendered “6 by Tories and jealous

 
Easthope, Sir John _18
Whigs. Included at this point is a copy of a
letter by Charles Grant, Lord Glenelg, Colonial
Secretary, approving the course Durham is pur-
swing in regard to the settlement of Canadian
problems. Durham's work caused a storm in Eng-
land, which is reflected in Easthope's letter

 

of Aug. 13. Excerpts of Daniel O'Connell's

long eulogy of Durham are quoted. By October,
1838, Durham writes of his return home. He en-
closes a letter by Sir John Colborne, who now
takes over. (No reference is made to the famous

Durham Report, the “o~ much of the future

 
Easthope, Sir John 19
colonial policy of Great Britain. This report

was supposedly written by Charles Buller, Jr.,
Durham's secretary, some of whose letters are
in these papers.) The remaining correspondence
from Durham is social. He comments on the Tory
Circle around Queen Adelaide in Dec. , 1839. On

 

July 10, 1840, just before his death, Durham
gives a vivid description of the criminal char-
acter of the lower part of Green Park,

An interesting description of the House of
Commons debate on the dissolution of the Orange
Lodges in Ireland and on Irish affairs

 
Easthope, Sir John 20
and railway building come from Henry Drummond

of Dublin on Mar. 3, 1836.

Daniel O'Connell writes a number of letters
to Easthope in 1836, 1837, and 1840, mostly
concerning political patronage. Many requests
for aid in securing political positions come to

 

Easthope during the Melbourne Ministry of the
eighteen thirties.

The series of letters from Lord John
Russell begins on Sept. 15, 1836, with a letter
to John Black, editor of the Chronicle, on poli-

tics. On Aug. 8 he i ion John Easthope

 
Easthope, Sir John 21
on winning a seat in the House of Commons. His

letters are political in character, referring
to Lord Brougham, the Tories, the attacks on
Queen Adelaide in the Chronicle, Canadian Union
and Poulett Thomson, and Palmerston and Turkey,
Peel and the Corn Laws, and the "unfortunate

 

appointment of Sir Charles Bagot to Canada.

In Jan. and Aug., 1842, French relations and the
Corn Laws receive comment. Lord John Russell
wrote on Oct. 19, 1842, of the "defective"
Ashburton Treaty, which he believed based on
commercial advantages @ concessions, Sir

 
Easthope, Sir John 22

 

Charles Bagot, Lord Sydenham, Lord Durham, and
Daniel Webster all are noted in regard to Cana-
dian affairs. On Oct. 26 he reviewed Canadian
politicians Nielsen, Baldwin, Lafontaine, Sir
A. McNeil, and Moffat. Although his party is
no longer in power, Russell's letters reveal

keen interest in such national issues as pay-

, ment of Roman Catholic and Protestant clergy,
inconsistency in Tory policies in the govern-
ments of Canada and Ireland (1843), and reform
of the Corn Law with a fixed rate (1844). The
letters stop in 1846, Se before Sir John

 
Easthope, Sir John 23
Easthope retired from Parliament.

. A series of Palmerston letters begins in
Oct., 1836, with discussion of the sources of
the Chronicle's Portugése and Spanish news,
particularly Senor Mendizabal. The London Times
relations with him are noted. In 1838 Palmer-

 

ston asked Easthope to stop attacks on British
consuls in Egypt. Palmerston is consulted by
Easthope in 1840 as to investment in French
railways, particularly the Paris and Rowen R. R.
Easthope also wrote to Guigot on this invest-
ment. Palmerston a i Oct. 11, 1840, a

 
Easthope, Sir John _ 24
letter on Egyptian ¢ affairs in which he discusses
the restoration of Mehemet Ali and French policy
in Egypt. (British relations with France are
reflected in many of the papers.) Edward Ellice
made a scathing criticism in Oct., 1840, of the
Morning Chronicle's policy of abusing France

 

about her Syrian and Egyptian policy. Reference
is made to Comte Walewski, French Minister to
Britain, Mehemet Ali, Palmerston, and the Lon-
don Conference (1840), (Evidently Easthope and
the Chronicle supported the Palmerston policy

in Syria.) When Lord ae s ministry fell

 
Easthope, Sir John 25
in 1841, the Queen conferred a baronetey on
Easthope. The Easthope papers are notable for
their consistent support of Lord Palmerston.

A letter of July 14, 1846, by M. Guizot
to Easthope discusses the peaceful, friendly
relations of France and England (1840-1846), the

 

means of maintaining this accord, and Lord
Palmerston's proposed visit to Paris. (This let-
ter was written as Lord Palmerston entered the
cabinet of Lord John Russell as Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs.) Included here in the

Easthope papers is a ry of an article for the

 
Easthope, Sir John 26
newspaper marked "by M. Guizot," dealing with
Anglo-French friendship and praising Whig
leaders. (It was probably inspired by M.
Guizot. )

Lady Palmerston described on Sept. 5, 1846,
a trip of the royal yacht, Victoria and Alberta,

 

 

on which Lord Palmerston was invited by the
Queen. On Sept. 29, Palmerston informs Easthope
that the Rothschilds are selling out in Paris,
and questions the effect of a "fall in funds"

on the government of Louis Philippe. Easthope,
in a letter in 1846 “oe” also mentions

 
Easthope, Sir John 27
Palmerston's visit to Paris and the strong
government elections in France. In 1848 Pal-
merston comments on the poverty of Ireland,
which is too poor to support a tax to pay its
priests. He refers to the "Swiss affair" and
"the bigot," Montalembert. In 1848 Palmerston

 

gave Andrew Doyle, the editor of the Morning
Chronicle, a warm testimonial, as to character,
and recommended him to Charles Buller, Jr.,
for a Poor Law Inspectorate.

John Black, editor of the Morning Chronicle

in 1837, wrote to “se that the paper

 

 
hastuope, pir Jvonn 238
must receive full documents if it is to report
government speeches. He commented on a speech
of Lord Morpeth, the 7th Earl of Carlisle. The
Melbourne letter to Easthope written on Jan. 2,
1846, (accompanied by a partial copy by Easthope
gave Melbourne's views on repeal of the Corn
Laws. Easthope wrote to Melbourne on Jan. 4,
1846, referring to M. Guizot, who is "kindly"
inclined to Palmerston, Melbourne's Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs.

George Edward Anson, secretary to Lord Mel-
bourne, became private secretary to Prince

 

 
Eastnope, Sir John 2g

 

Albert. He wrote some letters from Windsor
Castle. The first of his letters, written on
Aug. 8, 1837, set aside the rumor that Baron
Stockmar would become the private secretary of
Queen Victoria. Anson urged that any news of
the Queen be checked with him for validity. The
Queen's ladies-in-waiting are mentioned in Sept.

1841. He reviewed the John Topp incident in its
connection with Prince Albert in 1845, protest-

ing against press attacks on the Prince Consort

and describing his character. An attack on the

Court and its head by a disappointed office

 
Easthope, Sir John 30
seeker is noted on Nov. ll, 1545.

The Duke of Essex began a series of letters
in Oct., 1837, the contents of which touch light
ly on politics of the day. On May h, 1838, the
novelist, Louisa Sheridan, wrote a long letter
on memoirs--scandalous and otherwise-- of the

 

Duchess of St. Albans. Charles Grant, Lord
Glenelg, complained in. 1839 to Easthope as @
director of the Southampton R, R. of the service
of that line,

A few letters were sent to Easthope by
Edward J. Stanley, @ Second Beron Stanley

 
Easthope, Sir John 31
“of Alderley. He analyzed the role of the Peers
in parliamentary government in 1839, emphasiz-
ing reform; and he commented on Melbourne's
Irish policy. The attack of the Morning
Chronicle on Queen Adelaide, after the Dowager
Queen had made a visit to the Midlands, is
viewed as injudicious on Nov. 21, 1839. His
letter of Sept. 5» 1840, referred to "the
Beyrout business,” to the French reaction to
the deposition of Mohemet Ali of Egypt, and to
the need to confer with Lord John Russell before
newspaper comment.

William Cowper, who =) wrote on liberal poli

 

 
Easthope, Sir John 32
tics, had an interesting letter of Feb. 5, 1840,
on the financial arrangements of Queen Victoria.
He related the various charities and expendi-
tures of her Privy Purse of £60,000, some of
which were inherited from George IV and William
IV. He also referred on Mar. 31, 1842, toa

 

violent "Puseyistical" article of the Times and
reviewed the affairs of the Church of England.
Many references are made to the state of the
Church and religious affairs in the course of
the Easthope correspondence,

A number of “eo” from Sir Thomas

 
Easthope, Sir John 33
Wilde, a friend of Easthope, who rose from a
serjeant-at-law to Lord Chancellor. (Wilde de-
fended Queen Caroline in the divorce proceedings
instituted by George IV.) The early correspond-
ence dealt with an appointment for Wilde and
with his campaign to become a member of the

 

House of Commons. Henry Warburton described
Lord John Russell and his "repulsive humours"

in an account of an interview with him on behalf
of Wilde. A speech of Sir Thomas Wilde as re-
ported by the Morning Chronicle is the basis of

the quarrel between —_— and Sir John

 

 
Easthope, Sir John 34
Easthope in April, 1843.

Beginning in 1839 with the subject of the
reform of the House of Peers, Lord Methuen com-
ments casually on politics. He evidently sent
articles and material to the Morning Chronicle
for publication. On Apr. 26, 1842, he noted

 

 

British and German relations({?).

A few letters between Lord Normanly, East-
hope, and John Black dealt with appointments
to political, jobs.

Mary Russell Mitford, the novelist, wrote
from near Reading, “oe a few social notes.

 
Easthope, Sir John 35
In Feb., 1843, however, she thanks Easthope for

his kindness to her in regard to a subscription.
Dr. Stephen Lushington, Lord Chancellor,
commented on Apr. 10, 1840, on Chinese affairs.
He wanted to determine the policy of the Minis-
try in regard to shipping in case hostilities

 

arose with China.

Fox Maule, Under Secretary of State, wrote
with annoyance at a paragraph (clipping accom-
panying the letter) appearing in the Morning
Chronicle relating to Edward Oxford, who at-

tempted to mo | Queen and the Prince

 
Easthope, Sir John 36
Consort in 1840,

The series of letters from the Earl of
Clarendon to Easthope dealt with politics and
foreign affairs. Patronage, the Criminal
Justice Bill, the Charitable Trusts Bill, the
Chinese War (1841), French journalism, Daniel

 

O'Connell (1841), the British policy on slavery
(1842), the Corn Laws and the great distress of
the country (1843), Lord Ashburton, Lord Broug-
ham, the Tory bishops of Exeter and London,

Spanish failways, and "the sugar question;" all

 
Easthope, Sir John 37
are reviewed by Clarendon.

The best papers concerning internal condi-
tions in Great Britain are the short series of
letters from Richard Cobden to Sir John Easthope
and to John Black. They center on industrial
and agricultural distress in England. Cobden

 

was working very hard to abolish the Corn Laws
through the Anti-Corn Law League. Easthope
agreed to publish a series of letters by Somer-
ville in the Morning Chronicle, the cost parti-
ally to be paid by the League. Both men were
actively anti-Tory, “¢ discussing the dis-

 
Easthope, Sir John 38
astrous Tory policy "with the masses" and the

"knaves of Chartists." On Sept. 15, 1842, Cobden
wrote graphically of economic conditions, parti-
cularly in the North. There unemployment and
idle mills had accompanied three years of strife
conditions very bad for investments and the

 

great "manufactory system." Cobden believed
that distress among the middle classes would
force great constitutional changes. Reports of
riots and bad Chartist leaders are followed by
the statement that the aristocracy will have
to change. If the a? stood, revolution

 
Easthope, Sir John _ 39
would come. Other letters note details of Cob-
den's undermining of the Corn Laws. He analyzed
the meaning of Free Trade on Dec. 22, 1842.

He believed that the Whigs would come to this
doctrine. No change: short of revolution could
be made without the aid of a section of the

 

aristocracy (presumably the Whigs).

Charles Buller, Jr., wrote to Easthope on
Sept. 11, 1842, concerning Lord Palmerston and
American affairs. This excellent letter review-
ed the role of the King of Holland in the

negotiations with the ye States on the

 
Easthope, Sir John 40
Canadian boundary, the Featherstonhaugh Report,
Palmerston's attitude, the friendly attitude of
all British parties to the United States, and
Palmerston's attitude toward a "liberal party."
Writing on Dec. 22, 1845, to Andrew Doyle as
"C. B.," Charles Buller commented on "extinct"

 

Whiggery, mentioning Thackeray, Peel, and Rus-
sell. He stated there were no more Whigs; there
was a Liberal Party. On Dec. 23, "C. B." com-
mented on the Duke of Wellington's favoring the
repeal of the Corn Laws, an attitude which would
enable Sir Robert Peel ‘ carry the repeal in

 
Basthope, Sir John 41
Parliament.

The letters of Lord Fortescue, Lord Lieute-
nant of Devonshire, are casual, mentioning the
"Mathew Testimonial," John Black, Russell and
Peel and repeal of the Corn Laws, Lord Melbourne,
the Exeter Riots by R. R. laborers (1847), and

 

venison.

Lord Campbell, author of The Lives of the
Chancellors, wrote Easthope a number of casual
letters, chiefly concerning publicity for his
book in the Chronicle and the loss of the Libel

Bill (1844). =

 

 
 

Easthope, Sir John 42
Easthope evidently owned a series of houses

of increasing magnificence. Patric Parks, the
sculptor, who did a bust of Easthope; Joseph
Papworthy, an architect who worked at "Firgrove,"
the Easthope estate at Weybridge; and Joseph
Parkes, a parliamentary agent for the Whigs, a

friend of John Black, and a lawyer concerned
in Easthope land transactions; all revealed
details of Easthope's private affairs. Parkes
wrote in 1844 of an Italian trip, describing
Venice and a visit of Prince Metternich. He
also commented on _ Character and

 
Easthope, Sir John 43
the unpopularity of Daniel O'Connell with British
Liberals. On Mar. 19, 1844, Parkes described
the vote of Liberals Easthope, Russell, and
Howick with Shaftesbury on labor legislation.
Lord Shaftesbury, the great social reformer
wrote in 1843 of the National Education Bill

 

blasted by a union of Dissenters and Puseyites.
On Jan. 10, 1844, he referred to Indian affairs.
The opening of the debate on Graham's Factory
Bill on Mar. 14, 1844, is discussed in relation
to Shaftesbury's amendment to place a ten-hour

limit to work of 6 young people.

 
Easthope, Sir John a
Indian affairs are discussed by Lord Auck-
land, Governor General of India, 1836-1842, on
Mar. 10, 1844, when he wrote of Lord Ellen-
borough's advance into Gwalior. This military
action was based on the Treaty of Boorhampore,
discussed in despatches of Richard Wellesley ,

 

which Lord Auckland quoted on Mar. 10, 1844.
Macvey Napier, editor of the Edinburgh Re-
view, explained to Andrew Doyle on Aug. 27,
1845, his magazine's policy in keeping out of
areas of controversy.

Clippings of modern date deal with Easthope's
friends, Lords Palmerston and Brougham, and
the Anti-Corn Law League.

(Sir John Easthope retired from Parliament
in 1847, His newspaper had supported Palmer-
ston's Syrian and French policies. Lord John
Russell, making an alliance with the Times,

counties through which the Erie Canal ran. Gen.

 

Stephen Van Rensselaer named him the principal
at Rensselaer Polytech when he founded it in
1824. In June, 1827, William Tully (1785-1849),
eminent American physician, writes that Gen. Van
Rensselaer is at home, with the result that
Eaton writes to the General about a proposed

Walter Prichard Eaton (1878-1957) was an
author, drama critic, and college professor.
A native of Malden, Massachusetts, Eaton at
first was a drama critic but later turned to a
career of lecturing on dramatic topics and

writing books on nature, the theater, and Boy
Scouts, He was a professor of playwriting at
Yale University from 1933-1947, and later a
visiting lecturer at both the University of

 
Eaton, Walter Prichard
Texas and the University of North Carolina.

For more information see Who Was Who in America,
The collection consists of three articles
written by Eaton, The one entitled "Wildflower

Gardens of Old New England" describes the
wildflowers in the rural areas of Middlesex
County, Massachusetts, where Eaton lived as a

 

 

boy. Not only does the author explain the
optimum conditions for the growth of flowers,
such as gentians and mayflowers, he also
reminiscences about his experiences with these
plants, and laments the demise of many garden

“American Drama vs. Literature" is an un-
finished article in which Eaton put forth the
theory that since many of the modern plays
closely mirror the speech, customs, and feelings

 

of their day, they have a much shorter theatri-
cal life than was formerly the case. To Eaton,
it is only through seeing a play on the stage
in its day, not by reading it later from a
literary point of view, that one can understand

Eden, George, First Earl of Auckland.
Papers, 1847. London, England.

 

George Eden, Second Baron Auckland and First
Earl of Auckland (1784-1849), was a British
statesman and a governor general of India.

From 1846 to 1849 he was first lord of the
admiralty. On April 8, 1847, Lord Palmerston,
Foreign Secretary, wrote to Auckland and
suggested that his idea of offering the Pacific
naval command to Sir Charles Napier was
undesirable. Napier was commander of the
Channel fleet, and Palmerston considered his

 
Eden, George, First Earl of Auckland rs
presence there as an asset to foreign policy
because of the respect in which he was held by
foreign powers, notably France and Russia.

The last page of an undated letter from Lady
Palmerston is apparently addressed to either
the Earl of Auckland or to his son and
successor, the Third Baron Auckland.

William Eden's letters are those of his as
British Ambassador Extraordinary at the Hague ta
the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
William Wyndham Grenville, in 1793, a year when
the political situation was extremely critical
in Hodland and Belgium. He writes of returning
to England, a retirement which he achieved only
after the military successes of the Duke of York
and the Prince de Coburg in 1793.

The first letter from Antwerp, Austrian
Netherlands, reveals a conference of Eden with

 
Eden, William _2
the Duke of York, British military commander,
the Prince de Coburg, Austrian commander, Prince
Metternich and his assistant, the Comte de
Starhemberg, and William V of Orange. (The
European powers are gathering to move against
aggressive Revolutionary France.) The Apr. 8,

 

1793, letter by Eden describes the desertion
of the French General Dumouriez to the First
Coalition against France. It records the re-
sulting dispersion of the French Army. The

French National Assembly offers a reward for
the head of Dumouriez. ©. Prince de Coburg

 
Eden, William
begins to move the Austrian forces.
On Apr. 9, 1793, Eden cites the Duke of

York (letenmKing-Wi44+em.IV of England) for

zealous and efficient activity. Prussian forces
are on the Rhine River; the Dutch agree to send
in troops; the Allies thus prepare to take over

 

Belgium and the Rhine Provinces.

From the Hague on Apr. 26 Eden writes that
the Court at Vienna is making overtures for an
alliance with Great Britain. He speaks of the
"rapacious measures" of Prussia and Russia,

moves which may a ) "Co-operation" against

 
Eden, William “
France. Austria wants George III of England
to influence these two powers, so united re-
rity to Poland (i.e., The Second Partition,
1793).

References are made to the "mere nullity"
of Prussian military operations on the Rhine.

 

Among the European generals mentioned are:
Knobeldorff, de Wurmser, de Mack, Ouderberger,
Duke Frederick of Brunswick, Prince Frederick
of Orange, Dampierre, et al.

On Apr. 26 Eden writes of Austrian war
preparations. Coburg, S$ "honorable plain man,"

 
Eden, William
has the beloved Austrian, Prince de Hohenlohe,
as second in command. Archduke Charles of
Austria is preparing a public entry as Governor
General of the Low Countries. From Paris comes
news of "Anarchy, Violence, Execution, Civil
War, Famine, and Blasphemies."

 

The Duke of York with the Brigade of
Guards and the 10th Regiment of Hanoverian
Infantry has made an excellent showing in
several actions by May 14. Russian aid and
Allied operations receive comment. May 14 also
dates a letter on a i moves by Austria,

on donations in Belgium to her war chest, and
on Royalist movements in Brittany, Poitou, and

Anjou.
These copies are from originals in the

Public Records Office in London,
1 item added, 5-1-63.

 

On June 8, 1787, William Pitt writes to
Eden, British envoy in Paris, and discusses ar-
rangements for his transfer to Madrid. Eden
goes to Spain as ambassador extraordinary in

August. Pitt also comments on pension arrange-

 
Eden, William 7
ments and possible alternatives to the appoint-
ment at Madrid. He hopes that Eden will return
as soon as the condition of the Indian business
permits. (In August Britain and France conclude
an agreement on the disputes of the French and
English East India Companies). The dispatch
now being sent to Eden and the Duke of Dorsetfwil
inform them on the Dutch business. Pitt cong

 

siders the situation critical and expects Eden td
ascertain French intentions. France and England
Sign a treaty concerning Holland in November,
1787. Pitt also comments and inquires about

the French financial situation.

1 item added, 8-20-64. On Qct. 3, 1772,
Lord Suffolk, Secretary of State for the
Northern Department, wrote to Eden, Under Sec.
of State. He noted diplomatic news from the
continent, commented upon ambassador Gunning's
recent dispatches from Russia and their peculiar
manner of arrival, noted Lord North's election
as Chancellor of Oxford, and expressed his
regard for the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough.

death of the Speaker of the House of Commons.

7 items added, 8-30-67. Sometime during
1780-1782, John Robinson, Secretary of the
Treasury, promised to answer questions on the
City of London subscription and to convey
Lord North's sentiments. Nothing important
was expected in Parliament during the day.

Lord Loughborough responded (Sept. 11, 1780)

 

 
Eden, William 10

 

to Lord Carlisle's report about Eden's
communications with Lord North during
september 1-8, but only the last two pages of
the letter remain. They include a reference
to the election of 1780 in Yorkshire.

On May 5, 1782, Lord Carlisle reported the
reaction in London to Eden's political stance
and explained why he had accepted Lord
Rockingham's offer of the office of Lord
Steward of the Household.

On Oct. 3, 1786, Lord Carmarthen, Secrete

with France.

On Nov. 14, 1788, Anthony Storer reported
about George III's illness, the Regency
Question, and the Prince of Wales. Several
years later (Dec. 1, 1793) he commented on:

author; work at his estate of Purley for
which he had consulted Humphry Repton,

Pitt's new ministry of May, 1804, excluded
Auckland who had been Postmaster-General.

This episode was discussed by Charles Long on
May 17.

2 items added, 11-10-67. On Aug. 19, 1785,
the Duke of Portland congratulated Eden for his
role in stopping "Pitt's First System."

A letter from Lord Chichester apparently
was written in 1806, probably February. The
paper has a watermark of 1805. He referred to
the kissing of hands by new ministers, one of

 
Eden, William, First Baron Auckland 13
whom was apparently Lord Grenville who became
prime minister in February, 1806. Chichester
noted Lord Sheffield's desire to become a privy
councillor, and he intended to introduce to
Grenville a lawyer who had connections with the
U.S. minister.

sometime during 17037, and it may also have been

East India Convention, a treaty of August, 1787
between France and Britain.

of the Treasury, reported on Lord sorth's acci-

dent.

French wine. In a letter to an unknown corres-
pondent on October 2, 1789, Eden comments on
news of the revolutionary events in France and
on personal matters, In another letter to and
unknown correspondent, November 20, 1789, he
comments in greater length on the French politi
cal situation and other personal matters.

Co., Ala. 25 items Sketch

This collection consists mainly of letters
from Carrie McCord to Kate Edmond. Carrie was
an emotional young lady who wrote frankly
about her feelings and observations. Miss
Edmond had been a teacher of hers at Dallas
Academy in Selma.

 

In the summer of 1881 Carrie, her mother,
and her younger sister Mary, who was then
abaut eleven, set sail to join their father
and husband in Rio de Janeiro. He had been a
physician in Brazil for fifteen years, and

 
among 2
had been ill. “during the past year. Just before
his family left Selma to join him his other
daughter Stemma married. By Feb. 26, 1882 the
McCords had moved from Rio to Campos, Brazil.

The first letter which Carrie wrote after

arriving in Brazil tells of their sewen weeks!
voyage and her homesickness; describes Bahia,
Brazil, one of the stopping places during
their voyage; and mentions the gay life of

the Brazilians, especially on Sunday, and some
eristocratic friends of her father. These
friends, a viscount and viscountess, had

 

 
Edmond, Kate. __ cm
invitied the McCord family to their daughter's
wedding, and Carrie's letter contains a report
on this event.

Carrie was tutoring her sister Mary. She
speaks of the courses she is teaching her as
well as what she herself is studying. Clashes
often occurred between her and Mary over the

 

latter's rebellion against the authority of
her older sister.

Often Carrie writes of her homesickness
and people she had known back in Ala. Her
letters also mention the following: A

 
Eamona, Kate, _sS
Methodist missionary in Rio; floods and land-
slides near and in Campos; the kindness and
hospitality of the people, despite their
formal manners; the physical appearance of
Campos and the number of Catholic churches
there; the Catholic observance of Holy Week--
she was very critical of the beliefs and the

 

practices of that church; social life and
customs of the Brazilians; the Presbyterian
Church in Campos; smallpox in that city in
1882 and 1883; a handsome fee paid by a rich
bafoness at Quissaman to Dr. McCord for his

services; yellow fever in Rio in Mar, 1883;
the arrival in Campos of the Emperor and
Empress and their entourage to celebrate the
bringing of electricity to that city; the

un principled actions of the Lacerdo family
there who had threatened the life of Dr.McCord
and driven his friend Pimentels out of busi-

 

ness; marriage of a friend in Selma to John

Selma, Dallas County, Alabama

 

The seventy items in the Sterling F. Edmonds
papers are all of a legal nature--receipts, ac-
counts for the yearly hiring of Negroes, and
papers relating to legal suits.

Edmonds was a resident of Dallas County,

Alabama, who in 1836, finding himself hard pres-
sed by debts, conveyed in trust to John R.
Robertson of Marengo County, Ala., twenty-nine
Negro slaves that the profits from their hire

might be applied to the support of Edmonds'

 
Edmonds, Sterling F. 2

 

wife, Ann, and their three children, Emmet,
Richard, and Eugene. The remainder of Edmonds*
property and the five-thousand-dollar legacy
left him by his father-in-law, Richard Cocke
of Marengo County, was to be used to satisfy
the creditors of Edmonds. According to the

deei of trust, the trustee could resign or the
assignee could discharge the trustee and ap-
point a new one.

Subsequently, on Dec. 10, 18°78, Robertson
was removed as trustee and William S. Jeffries

oO

 
Edmonds, Sterling F.

 

of Selma, Dallas County, Ala., was instated.
From 1838 until his death in 1846 Jeffries ac-
ted as trustee for Edmonds, caring for the
expenses of the family, seeing to the annual
hiring of Negroes, and, on occasion, disbursing
sums from his own pocket to satisfy Edmonds'*
creditors. At the death of Jeffries in 1846,
Sterling F. Edmonds appointed his father, Ben-
Jamin Edmonds, as trustee. The two Edmondses
then attempted to secure Sterlings's properties

which were being held by Algernon Jeffries, the

 
Edmonds, Sterling F. : 4

 

administrator of the estate of William 9.
Jeffries. The petition of Algernon Jeffries
to the Chancery Court, 1847, pleading that
the Edmonds be restrained from taking the pro-
perty until William Jeffries' estate had been
satisfied, is among the papers.

Also included in this collection are sev-
eral petitions and depositions (1844-1850)
dealing with two other suits: (1) Mary Eliza
Brown et al. vs. Hugh M. Grant regarding the
settlement of the David McCord estate; and
(2) a petition concernins the administration
of the estate of William F. Durham, who had

 
Edmonds, Sterling FP.

been the attorney in the Brown vs. Grant case.
The connection between the Brown vs. Grant case
and the Edmonds papers is not readily discern-

 

ible.

Major Henry Edmondson was evidently a justice
of the peace in Montgomery Co.,Va. as early as
1812. His home was on the north fork of the
Roanoke River. He had at least two children,
Henry, Jr. and Jamps P. Apparently he was a ma
of importance in western Va.,since he was a jus-
tice of the peace and kept in close touch with
Francis Preston.

William Edmondson may have owned Idlegreen
Mill with which he was identified in a list of
petitioners that dates from about 1835. During
the 1830's he was active in the movement to
repeal or revise the Factory Acts, and he was a

member of the West Riding Mill Owners Deputation
that went to London in 1838 (letter of May 1).

one who died in 1838 (provided this date is
correct).

Edmondson was addressed as a churchwarden

a group of documents, 1742-1842, on poor relief
at Idle and other nearby places, These docu-
ments include: a statement by the church-
wardens and overseers of the poor of Pateley
Bridge that relief for George Kimg is chargeable

In the early nineteenth century the Edmons-
tons were apparently settled in western North
Carolina. From there Bazil Edmonston, father of
Niniag migrated to Indiana where, in 1835, he
was located at Jasper in “ubois County. Ina
letter of that year he details the death of his

 

wife and a daughter. One of his sons, B.B.
Edmonston, was living in Vandalia, Illinois, and
was a member of the state legislature. The
(Civil War) letters are those of Benjamin and
Basil B, Edmonston, sons of Ninian, who had

remained in North Carolina. Both men were in
the Confederate service and in 1864 participated
in the defense of Petersburg, Virginia. On
July 30,1864, Benjamin Edmonston was severely
wounded, probably in the Battle of the Crater,
and died on August 28,1864. The material is
too fragmentary to present much of a picture of
the Edmonston family, but it does offer reveal-
ing glimpses.

Frederick Commins Edwards, Episcopal minis-
ter, published poet, and former president of
the American Society for Psychical Research,
was born in Cornwall, England, in 1863. He
came to the United States and graduated from

Dickinson College in Pennsylvania in 1886. Six
years later he entered the ae te Theologi-

cal Seminary in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and
was ordained as a minister in 1894. Until

*

 
Edwards, Frederick Commins 2
1905 he was successively pastor of Trinity
Church, Bridgewater, Mass., and of St. Paul's
Church, Malden, Mass. From 1905 until 1912 he
was rector of St. James’ Church in Milwaukee,
Wis., after which he served as Select Preacher
of Grace Church in New York. His last official
position, from which he retired in 1920, was
Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in Detroit. After
his voluntary retirement from the ministry, he
devoted much of his time to the study of psych-

ical phenomena, especially survival after death,

 

 
Edwards, Frederick Commins 3

 

and became president of the American Society
for Psychical Research for 1925-1926. He
later moved to DeLand, Florida, but continued
to travel, especially to his summer home,
"Arcady," in New Brunswick, Canada. He died
in 1948.

Edwards was married to Emma (Ridgway)
Satterthwait who had a daughter, Elizabeth
Ridgway Satterthwait, by a previous marriage.
They had two children: a daughter who died in

infancy and a son, Frederick Trevenen, who was

 
Edwards, Frederick Commins 4

 

killed in World War I.

The collection consists largely of the vol-
umes which comprise the journal that Edwards
kept, and of originals and copies of letters
that Edwards' son Trevenen wrote during the
First World War. The journal of Frederick
C. Edwards consists of fifty-two bound volumes,

covering some of the years between 1884 and
1945. He did not arrange the journal strictly
chronologically. Entries were made instead

according to the month and day of the year--the

 
Edwards, Frederick Commins P)
month providing the organizational framework
rather than the year. Hence a volume for
January 1-6 contains entries for those dates of
the month for all calendar years represented.
The volumes have been paginated to simplify
their use.

The journal contains letters, sermons, na-

 

ture essays, book orders, and some clippings
and financial records. The content of the let-
ters and essays is often routine and sometimes
incomplete. There are many letters of fatherly
advice written by Edwards to his son while the

 
Edwards, Frederick Commins ne 6
latter was either a student or in the army.
Also numerous are letters to friends, which in-
dicate Edwards' active concern for their wel-
fare, and book orders, which reveal the wide
range of his intellectual interests.

Journal entries for the years 1933 and 1935
are among the most valuable in the collection.

 

These entries are largely Edwards' comments
about both Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New
Deal, and the effects of the Depression upon

the lives of people he saw and knew.

 
Edwards, Frederick Commins 7

 

The journals also contain a considerable
amount of material relative to Edwards' inter-
est in Spiritualism and psychical research,
although there is not much material describing
his tenure as president of the American Society
for Psychical Research. His interest in this
field became more acute after the death of

his son. Edwards accepted life after death as
scientifically proven, and attempted to mesh
his spiritualist beliefs with his firm faith in

Christianity and extensive knowledge of Christ-

 
Edwards, Frederick Commins 8
ian doctrine. He had ‘contact with others in-
terested in psychic phenomena, such as James
Hervey Hyslop, founder of the A. S. P. R., and
J. B. Rhine, director of the Parapsychology
Laboratory, situated until 1965 at Duke Univer-
sity. In the journal, Edwards writes of his
sittings with various mediums and of his

 

(alleged[?]) contact with his son after the
latter's death. The actual transcriptions of
these sittings are not a part of this collection

except in a few instances (e. g., Vol. 2, pp.

 
Edwards, Frederick Commins 9

151-177), but Edwards did compile a number of

volumes containing records of such sittings.

Some accounts of these occurrences may be found

in the book Trevenen: A Text & Study of Survi-

val and Communication.
The unbound letters written during World

War I by Edwards' son describe in a very

literate manner the experiences of a seminary

student turned soldier, from his enlistment

in 1917 through his participation in the battles

of the Marne and St. Mihiel, and in the Argonne.

 

 

 

 
Edwards, Frederick Commins 10

 

There is also a typed draft of these letters
emended by Rev. Edwards. The letters’ were
published by Elizabeth Satterthwait in 1954 in
a book entitled Fort Sheridan to Montfaucon:
The War Letters of Frederick Trevenen Edwards.
The remainder of the collection consists of
assorted volumes and notebooks. There are

 

 

volumes of Trevenen's poetry, plays, and short

stories, as well as Edwards’ own notebooks of
nature poems which were Later published as

The Natural Year. There are printed copies of
both editions of this book in the Perkins

 

 
Edwards, Frederick Commins 11
Library. There are several scrapbooks contain-
ing newspaper clippings pertaining to months

of the year, a volume of notes for sermons and
addresses, and a scrapbook Edwards compiled
while he was a student at Dickinson College.

The collection also contains a bound volume en-
titled "50 Letters Concerning Frederick Edwards."

mont College. Thereafter he trained for a rail
road career by working in various capacities
for the Atlantic & Western of which he eventu-
ally became general manager, a position he oc-
cupied until 1927 when the company was sold and
reorganized. He also worked during 1919-1921

 

 

for the Federal Railway Administration. While

came the principal owner and manager of the At- |
lantic & East Carolina Railway that he continued
to operate until it was sold to the Southern

Edwards, Harry P, a
The collection consists of numerous photo-
graphs, clippings, and printed items and a small

number of letters relating primarily to Edwards'
career with the “Atlantic & Western, the Atlanta
& At. Andrews Bay, and the Atlantic & East Caro-
lina railroads and with the Edwards Railway

Motor Car Company. There is some material about

his family and his work with the Chamber of Com-
merce at New Bern. The items were originally in
a scrapbook that has been dismantled in order to
facilitate preservation of the. material.

A folder of biographical information contains
considerable data about Edwards and his career,

 
 

Edwards, Harry P, 5
The folder of Edwards Family Pictures includes

a number of photographs of Edwards and members
of his family, including one of his father Wil-
liam Joseph Edwards. Harry Edwards also appears
in the folders of photographs and clippings for
the businesses that he managed.

The folders on the Atlantic & Western Rail-

way contain about a dozen clippings and pictures
relating to its history as late as 1961. Both
clippings and photographs include pictures of

the gasoline powered sult-prepalion passenger

car as an economical replacement for passenger
trains on the Atlantic & Western, and the cars
were first used on that line. When the cars
=the successful, Edwards organized the Edwards

ilway Motor Car Co. at Sanford in, 1921 for '
their manufacture. During the 1920's and 1930's

liam J, Mayo. There are also several letters

and clippings.

The 181 items about the Atlantic & East Caro-
lina Railway include numerous pictures and clip-
ae and a small number of letters and printed

tems, This line was built by the state of

 
Harry P, 10
arolina, and over the years it suffered
many difficulties. It operated between Golds-
boro and Morehead City via Kinston and New Bern.
In the late 1930's the company, then the Atlan-
tic & North Carolina, was losing money and its
track and equipment were in poor condition. The
state offered to lease the line, and Edwards ac-
quired the lease in 1939. He continued to own
and operate it until its purchase by the South-
ern Railway in 1957. Edwards managed the com-
pany so that it earned a profit every year, and
e repaired and upgraded its rolling stock and

 

 
11
phy ities and track. As with the Bay
Line, he turned failure into success.

The pictures include: employees; members of
the Edwards family; rolling stock; interior and
exterior views of the private car "Carolina;"
facilities and track; a heater car for passenger
trains and a ballast plow designed by Edwards

 

and built by the A & EC; various scenes at Golds
boro, Kinston, New Bern, and Morehead City, in-

The Egerton General Store was an institution
at Macon for generations. The reminiscences
in 1966 of Mary Egerton (Thornton) Lawrence
state that Gilbert Grey Egerton, her grand-
father, founded the store long before the
Civil War. It continued operations under the
direction of a son, Benjamin Iredell Egerton
(d. 1894). His sons, Walter Egerton and
William Grey Egerton, ran the store for a

 
Egerton, William Grey 2

 

time as Egerton Brothers, but they dissolved
the partnership and William became sole owner.
The store closed after the death of William
Egerton in 1935. Mrs. Lawrence's reminiscences
are filed in a box stored with the volumes.

The earliest volume in the collection is a
daybook of 1888-1889 from the general store
of Egerton Brothers at Macon. (vol. 6972)

In 1910 W. G. Egerton operated a general
store and a cotton gin at Macon. Two years
later he also owned a general store at

 
Egerton, William Grey
Vaughan, a village a few miles east of Macon.
This information comes from The North Carolina
Year Book and Business Directory. His store
at Macon is represented by an incomplete
series of daybooks and ledgers, 1904-1914:

Two volumes in the form of ledgers for non-
consecutive periods of 1910-1911 and 1912-
1917 *also belonged to W. G. Egerton. Occasional
entries marked "By Ledger" can be traced into
the ledgers listed above. Further, several

items of correspondence addressed to him were
found within the volumes, and they include
transactions recorded in them. These two
volumes were referred to as "Ticket Books,"
an unusual term, according to the notations

May-Nov. (p. 333); the Ticket Book, 1911-1912
(p. 93); and in Ledger I, p. 597. The

Ticket Books contain mercantile transactions
for the same period as the daybooks and

ledgers but are separate from them. The
Ticket Books are set up in the ledger form,
but the absence of posting notations suggests
that they were also books of original entry

Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915), outstanding German
scientist and profound research worker, founded
the Institute Of Experimental Theraphy at Frank-
furt in 1899, He was renowned for his immunolo-
gical work. A series of four letters comes from
Nobel Prize winner Emil von Behring (1854-1917),
who worked on vegetable poisons immunity, and
finally a successful diphtheria antidote. The
correspondence deals with poisons, immunization,
toxoids, viruses, and and antidotes. Von Be

Johann Christian Ehrmann (1749-1657), mili-

tary surgeon at Frankfurt on Main, was also a
Ssax$irist and contemporary of Goethe, His papers
deal with his medical work at Frankfurt and his
compensation by the Royal Prussian War College
and by the quartermaster of the Hohenlohe Corps.
Ehrmann sent a case of instruments to Paris in
1798, Michel Augustin Thouret (1748-1810),
French hygenist and Director of the Ecole de
Sante, acknowledging them. Evidently the
faculty of the school were to give an opinion

 

 
Ehrmann, Johann Christian 2
on these instruments for the reduction of the
lower extrem$ties. A curious document in 1805
by Ehrmann in regard to a death certificate for
a French grenadier states that French casualties
were not treated differently than dead horses.
His superior, J. W. Marglar, also comments on

 

this case, Ehrmann was physician in charge of
the military hospital at Frankfurt. Marglar,
his superior, refuses his seal on Ehrmann's

document.

Samuel Elbert (1743-1788) was born in Prince
William Parish,S. C. At an early age, he
moved to Savannah where he became a merchant.
He entered the Continental Army as a lieutenant
colonel in 1776. He served in East Florida and

Georgia and was with Washington at Yorktown.
He was promoted a brigadier general in 1783.
After serving as governor of Georgia from

1336 to_ 1788, he died in Savannah on Nov. 2,
1788. Elbert County, Ga. was named in his honor

Among his papers are land deeds, certificates
for land bounties, and a letter (Jan. 27, 1779)
from Leonard Marbury to Elbert. Marbury
discussed the defeat of the British at Bryan
Creek Bridge, Ga.

The volume is an account book kept by Elbert
from 1776 to 1788. It includes accounts for the

 

Second Battalion of the State of Georgia (1776-
1777), records of a plantation and its overseer,
and Elbert's personal accounts. Two flowers
which appear to be violets had been pressed in

John Elder (1833-1895), artist, was born in
Fredericksburg, Virginia. He left there in 1850
for New York City, where he studied drawing under
Huntington. “Soon thereafter Elder travelled to
Dusseldorf, Germany, to continue his training.

In 1856 he returned to the United States, living
in New York City for five years and then return-
ing to Fredericksburg. During the Civil War

Elder served with the Confederate Army; after

 
Elder, John Adams 2

 

the war he resumed his painting career in Rich-
mond, Virginia. Some of his paintings grew out
of his military experience, such as “The Battle
of the Crater, ' "Scout's Prize," and “After
Appomattox." Elder also specialized in portrait
notably those of "Stonewall" Jackson and Robert
E. Lee.

The earliest letters in this collection
(1850's) were written by John Minor, a Freder~
icksburg patron, to Elder in Dusseldorf. Minor's

letters give detailed comments on the sketches

 
Elder, John Adams

 

and portraits which Elder shipped home for sale.
The few letters for the Civil War period are
addressed to his sister, Maggie, by various
Confederate soldiers of her acquaintance.
In 1875, Elder was commissioned by William
ilson Corcoran to paint the portraits of Lee
and Jackson which now hang in the Corcoran Gal-

lery in Washington. There is correspondence in
the Gollection in 1875 and 1876 concerning this
matter. Elder painted portraits of other de-

ceased Confederate officers, as is evidenced by

 
Elder, John Adams 4
the letters from Mrs. George Pickett and Mrs.
J. E. B. Stuart.

Included in the papers for 1876 and 1877 are
four copies of official reports on the Sioux
Wars, primarily concerning the Battle of the
Little Bighorn River. Elder evidently used
these reports as source material for his famous

 

battle-scene "Custer's Last Charge." Several
letters in 1884 and 1885 concern putting this
painting on display at various exhibitions, such

as the Southern Exposition wn Louisville, Ky.,

 
Elder, John Adams 5
and the New Orleans Exposition.

The collection includes letters from publish
ing and printing houses in connection with the
reproduction of Elder's works. Several of these
communications are from Jos. van Holt Nash, the

Ellet, Alfred Washington. Papers. Bunker Hill,
Macoupin Co., Illinois

 

Alfred Washington Ellet was the brother of
Charles Ellet, Jr., a civil engineer, early
exponent and designer of suspension bridges,
and the earliest advocate of rams for military
use in the Civil War. Alfred Washington Ellet

became commander of the Union ram fleet designed
by his brother after Charles Ellet's death in

1862.
The bulk of the correspondence in this

 
Ellet, Alfred Washington

collection is from the 1850's. There are
numerous letters of Mary Israel Ellet to her
sons Alfred and Edward Carpenter Ellet in
Illinois. Mary Ellet writes from Philadelphia
about friends and family there, occasionally
mentioning politics or her son Charles' engi-
neering career, as in her letter of August 2,

 

1855, when she discusses his designing the
bridge at Niagara Falls.

Charles Ellet writes to his brother Alfred
concerning his purchase of land warrants in

 
Ellet, Alfred Washington 3

Tllinois. Alfred acts as his brother's agent

in his land speculation ventures, Charles

also outlines plans for loaning money to small

farmers whose lands are contiguous with his own.
There is little correspondence in the Civil

War period. In 1865 correspondence between

Sherard Clemens and Alfred Ellet carries some

 

vague hints of misconduct on Clemens' part
(June 12, 1865).

In 1866, Edward Carpenter Ellet, the son of
Alfred Ellet, goes to Mississippi to work a

 
Ellet, Alfred Washington 4
plantation near Yazoo City. His letters and
those of his partner contain comments on agri-
cultural conditions, the political sentiment in
their neighborhood, Negro labor, and their
feelings toward their Southern neighbors.

The writings in this collection make up for
the scarcity of Civil War correspondence,
There are sketches of the lives and military
careers of Charles Ellet, Jr. and Alfred W.
Ellet. A manuscript, "Charles Ellet, Jr. and
his Steam Rams," describes his advocacy and

 

 
Ellet, Alfred Washington Ss
invention of the ram for military use and des-
cribes the action of the ram fleet in several
important battles. There is a description of
the battle at Memphis where Charles Ellet was
mortally wounded,

The legal papers contain some early items
that include an indenture dated 1759 and a

 

record of the marriage ceremony of Hannah Erwin
and Israel Israel, the parents of Mary Israel

Ellet.
The one volume is a family record containing

 
Ellet, Alfred Washington

 

genealogy of the Lloyd and Carpenter families
from whom Alfred Ellet was descended.

Further information on the Ellet family is
found in Mary (Israel) Ellet, The Memoirs of
Mary Israel Ellet, (1780-1870).

A letter attached to the inside back cover
of the volume is a modern letter from B, F,
Carpenter, who speculated about Ellett's life.
Carpenter also mentioned the existence of a
manuscript work on surveying by Ellett.

Carpenter thought that Ellett was originally
from Virginia but later lived in North Carolina.
Ellett may have lived in King William County,
Virginia. A William Ellett with 300 acres
appears on a list of land taxed in that county

cause of its comprehensiveness and its dating
from the mid-18th century. It includes tables

Gilbert Elliot, First Earl of Minto (1751l-
1814), was Governor General of India, 1807-
1813. He was civil commissioner at Toulon
during the British occupation of 1793 and
Viceroy of Corsica, 1794-1796. His twelve-page
letter of Dec. 21, 1793, was an explanation of
the British withdrawal from Toulon in which the
Spanish and Neopolitan troops were severely
criticized, The Toulon refugees were also
discussed,

The addressee was probably Henry Dundas,

been in India since 1827.

There are thirty-nine letters, 1840-1853,
from Elliot to his son Henry Lettsom Elliot
while the latter was attending several pre-
paratory schools in England, those of Miss

 

Berry and Edward Wickham in the early 1840's
and afterward the Winchester School. There is
considerable comment about the Winchester

School, 1844-1851, Elliot wrote about his
son's education and also reflected upon his own

 
Elliot, Sir Henry Miers 3
student days there. His letter of April 20,
1850, has a reference to a student riot in 1817
which was prompted by recent events of a simi-
lar nature. There are letters from the head-
master, David Williams, in 1827 and 1844. The
letters include occasional information about
Elliot's career and events in India.

 

Manuscripts and topics about Indian affairs
include: documents about Elliot's education
for Indian service, 1827-1828, and about his

James E, Ellis was executive secretary of a
committee on Christian education in the Metho-
dist Church of Brazil. In response to an
inquiry from someone at the Duke University
Divinity School, possibly a student, he wrote a

letter in which he enclosed several pamphlets
on his church, a translation of its constitution,
and notes on its structure and publications,

The pamphlets and others which he stated he

would send at some future date are not included
in this collection. The letter, dated October
25, 1935, also includes favorable comments on

Wisconsin

 

John R. Ellis was an infantryman in Co. F,
22nd Wisconsin Volunteers during the Civil War.
He was of Welsh descent, and the 22nd Regiment
was largely composed of Welshmen residents in
Wisconsin.

The collection includes one letter dated
Dec. 10, 1862, from John R. Ellis to Miss
Ellen Pritchard. In the letter he indicates

 
Ellis, John R.

 

he has sent a "likeness" of himself to her.
Also included is a small unidentified diary
in Welsh with entries from Aug. 13, 1862, to
March 12, 1863. There are 71 written pages
in the diary, but six pages are missing. The
six pages missing cover the time period Jan.

28 through Feb. 6, 1863. The handwriting is
the same for the letter and the diary. A

type-written translation of the diary accom-
panies the collection. It is thirteen pages

in length.

 
Ellis, John R, 3
The diary is a detailed portrait of regi-
mental life. The entries begin with Ellis
enlisting for service on Aug. 13, 1862, in Ra-
cine, Wisconsin and ends on March 12, 1863, at ~
Brentwood, Tenn. During the course of the
diary, Ellis does not participate in any bat-

 

tles or skirmishes, but he does describe the
countryside near Covington, Ky., where fighting
has taken place. In two instances, he mentions
traveling by campsites where Confederate

 
Ellis, John R. 4
soldiers have been. At one of these sites,
Camp Dick Robinson in Garrard Co., Ky, he
describes how on Dec. 12, 1862, his company
secures supplies left by the troops for them-
selves. Among the items mentioned are can-
nons and barrels of pork. He mentions the
names of several men who died and of one

 

desertion. In one of the last entries, March
6, 1863, he says he heard his regiment has been
taken as prisoners with the exception of 150,
together with nearly all of the Brigade. The

 
Ellis, John R, 5
entries end before we know if this is true.
From Racine, Wisc. in Aug., 1862, Ellis's
company travels by rail to Cincinnati (nick-
named the Queen City). He gives a good de-
scription of traveling on the railroad and
how well the civilian people at the railway

 

stations receive them. After his company
disembarks from the train in Cincinnati,
it is on foot, usually traveling from one
campsite or town to another,

 
Ellis, John R. 6
From Cincinnati they begin their march to:
Covington, Ky., Sept. 22, 1862; Camp Blood-
good, Ky., Sept. 24, 1862; Camp Smith, Ky.,
Oct. 9, 1862; Camp Wells, Williamstown, Ky.,
Oct. ll, 1862; Georgetown, Ky., Oct. 21,
1862; Lexington, Ky., Oct. 24, 1862; Camp

 

Grainger, Ky., Oct. 30, 1862; Camp Coburn,
Nicholasville, Ky., Nov. 23, 1862; Danville,
Ky., Dec. 13, 1862; Nashville, Tenn., Feb.
7, 1863 and finally Brentwood, Tenn., March

2, 1863.

 
Ellis, John R,. 7
There are recurring topics in the entries,
Writing and receiving letters seems to be a
favorite past time. There are many references
to and descriptions of the weather. He talks
of worshipping on the Sabbath and sometimes
attending prayer meeting services on Sunday

 

evenings. Ellis writes of repetitious chores
such as company, regiment and batallion drills
and guard and picket duty. He describes the
conditions of the roads the company has to

 
Ellis, John R,. 8
travel on and the establishment of new camp-
sites. He mentions seeing prisoners along
the marches and other troops. He also talks
often of his company either joining or being
joined by other troops in their marches. For
the most part, he discusses the senior com-

 

manders in only the briefest way. He does
mention Col. Swane, acting Brigadier General
of the 100th Ohio Regiment. Ellis's company
had joined this regiment for a time. Ellis

 
Ellis, John R. 9
describes Swane as conceited and having a bom-
bastic style. He speaks of two instances
in which property was confisticated,.

The importance of the railroad in the Civil
War is illustrated throughout the entries.
Transporting the wounded and the prisoners

 

of war, as well as the troops ready for com-
bat are noted. One is also reminded of the imp-
ortance of defending railroad depots and

bridges.

 
Ellis, John R. 10
Three unexpected items are reported in the
entries. One occurs on Oct. 8, 1862, while
the company is marching through Kentucky.
Ellis reports reaching the Canton (sic
Kenton) County Fair Ground. He describes
what he calls a "most beautiful building"

 

presumably one that has been used to hold
exhibitions. On Nov. 4, 1862, he says he
voted, and voted for the Democratic ticket.
On Jan. 1, 1863, he describes attending a
Mule Race in Danville, Ky.

Robert William Elliston (1774-1331), British
actor, married Elizabeth Rundall in 17963; see
the Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 66, Pt. l, p.
523. A letter from Mrs. H. Rundall at Madras
on Jan. 3, 1815, to her "sister" is probably
addressed to Mrs. Elliston, for it closes with

 

 

compliments to Mr. Elliston. A brother of Mrs.
Elliston is noted but unidentified in George
Raymond, The Life and Enterprises of Robert
William Elliston, Comedian (London, 1857), p.26

 

 

 
Elliston, Robert William v rd
There are apparent references to the Rundalls
in early issues of the Asiatic Journal. The
letter concerns personal and family matters.
