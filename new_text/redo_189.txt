W. W. Holden (1818-1892) was born in Orange
County,N.C., educated in the common schools,
admitted to the bar, and subsequently became a
journalist in Raleigh. In 1865 Pres. Johnson
,sppointed him provisional governor of North
Carolina, and in 1868 he was elected to that
office by Republican votes, from which he was
removed in 1870 after impeachment.

574 items and 13 vols. added, 7-7-60.
These papers center around the family of Gov-
ernor Holden, although a few political let-

ters are included, a first wife, who

 
Holden, William Woods 5

 

died on June 20, 1852, was Ann Augusta Young,
the niece of William Peace of Raleigh. Through
her, he is involved as administrator of a fam-
ily estate from 1843 to 1850, when he wrote to
W. H. Haywood he wished to settle this business.
Chas. Manly, attorney for heirs of John Peace

(presumably whose estate Holden administered),
wrote to Holden in 1852 concerning claims.

W. W. Holden was married a second time in
1854 to Louisa Virginia Harrison of Raleigh.
She took over the Holden household of four child

ren on Hargett ees until 1900 most of

 
Holden, William Woods 6

 

the Holden letters are addressed to her, her
four step-children, and her own four children,
The first Holden letter to Louisa is dated 1857
on a trip to Clinton, N. C., where he made a
political speech. He was accompanied by Charles
Harrison, presumably Louisa's brother.

In 1858-1859, Laura Holden, the eldest daugh-
ter, attends Salem Academy, receiving a number
of letters of counsel from her father.

Holden went as a N, C, delegate to the Demo-
cratic National Convention in April, 1860, in
Charleston, S. C, He describes the city on the

 
Holden, William Woods 7

 

eve of the Civil War. Among the N, C. delega-
tion (Avery, Gaston, Green, Ashe) the great
question was who would be the nominee for the
Presidency. Holden was a Stephen A. Douglas man
and believed the Buchanan administration and the
deep South persecuted Douglas.

Evidently the Holden family liked to spend

vacations in Beaufort, N. C., where Louisa
Holden was staying in August, 1860, when her
husband described the visit of Stephen A, Doug-
las to Releigh. Holden attended the Douglas
convention on Aug. 30, and found his own posi-

 
Holden, William Woods

 

 

tion between Douglas and Breckenridge "critical,
He saw no chance of reconciliation between the
two candidates,

From Camp Bragg near Suffolk, Va., Holden
writes on duly 8, 1861, to describe the N. C,
troops. He refers to their cheerfulness. The
3rd N. C, had left for the James River, but the

4th N. C. was still in camp. Col. Junius Daniel
(later brig. gen.) was in command. Holden re-
fers to Capt. Harris and many other members of
the Rifles and Guards. (See the Holden Ledger
for references to business transeations of the

 
Holden, William Woods
Raleigh Standard during the Civil War.)

Calvin J. Cowles writes in Oct., 1864, from
Wilkesboro, N. ©. He was evidently a dealer in
herbs and roots collected in the mountains, and
he also was sending Holden subscriptions to the
Standard. He speaks of a movement in the N. C.
legislature favoring a meeting of the governors
in Augusta, Ga. He also refers to brandy sei-
zures by the C.S.A,

President Andrew Johnson appointed W. W.
Holden as Provisional Governor of N. C. on May
29, 1865. Richard H. Battle and F. J. Haywood

 

 
Holden, William Woods _10
write to Holden in this period. Photostats of
letters from Wm. H. Seward dated Dec. 23, 1865,
relieve Holden of his office and turn it over to
Jonathan Worth, who has been élected,.

Calvin Cowles, Republican chairman of the N.
C, constitutional convention of 1865, writes in
1867 to Ida Holden, who became his second wife.

 

Ida writes in 1868 from Wilkesboro, referring to
Holden's “old enemy" (malaria?). Thereafter for
many years her letters come from Charlotte, N.C.,
where C, J. Cowles is head of the U. S. Mint.
There is a certificate issued to Holden on

 
Holden, William Woods

 

 

Aug. 18, 1869, by Kemp P. Battle, President of
the N. C. Agricultural Society, as a life member
of that society.

Thos. Rivera of Wilmington and Samuel F,.
Phillips, Speaker of the N. C. House in 1870,
are correspondents. John Harden of Graham gives
details of Ku Klux Klan activities in Alamance

County on Feb. 1, 1871.

At this time, Holderi was plagued by the
"Ferrell Matter," a debt case in which he was a
surety.

Impeachment proceedings in Raleigh against

 
Holden, William Woods 12

 

Governor Holden early in 1871 sent him to Wash-
ington. From here on Mar. 8, 1871, begins a
long series of letters to his wife and children.
He pictures Washington with radical Republicans
in control, questions what will be his future,
and refers many times to President Grant, for
whose aid Holden hoped in securing a government
position. Judge Thos. Settle of N. C. was a
friend of Holden in these days, as was John
Neathery and Samuel F. Phillips. Calvin J.
Cowles went to New York to raise money in April,
1871, but was unsuccessful. Finances at this

 
Holden, William Woods 14

 

period were evidently uncertain, but Holden in-
dicated that all real estate was secured to Mrs.
Holden. He wrote before the actual impeachment
that he took it for granted he would be found
guilty; later he wrote to Louisa that time would
moderate the feeling against him. By the end of
April, Holden's son, Joseph William, who was

Seeking "a place" went west to Omaha, Nebraska,
Jo had been his father's secretary and partner,
as well as Speaker of the N. C. House in 1868.
With cases pending against him in N. C,, Gov-
ernor Holden was undecided about returning home.

 
Holden, William Woods 14

 

The family came to Washington in June, 1871,
when Holden was beginning to think about a news-
paper position. He states that if he returns to
politics, he will pay off certain scores which
have accumulated. By Aug. 28, he decides to
accept the political editorship on the Chronicle
as he cannot return home till there are no more

"“harrassments." On Dec, 1, 1871, he writes to
Lewis P. Olds, husband of his daughter Laura,
that he cannot "accept anything" from the Gener-
al Assembly, and speaks of “all good people" su
taining his attack on the Ku Klux Klan.

 
Holden, William Woods

 

On Mar. 2, 1873, through his friend, Judge
Robert M. Douglas, the President has agreed to
appoint Holden a deputy postmaster at Raleigh.
He comes home.

The daughters of the family visited in west-
ern N. C. Son Joseph had also returned to Ra-
leigh. He was elected Mayor in 1874, shortly
before his death in 1875. Holden's letters to
his family continue affectionate, concerned, and
serious, Son-in-law C, J. Cowles refers to gold
mining at Gap Creek, N. C., in 1875. Judge
Robert Paine Dick, an old friend and political

 
Holden, William Woods 16
ally, writes in these years of Holden's wrongs
and of Prohibition in N, C,

Although retired from public life, Holden's
pen was not idle. A statement to the Raleigh
News on Oct. 7, 1876, answers accusations in the
Philadelphia Times. He reviews the activities
of Bryan Laflin, Judge Milton Littlefield, and

 

 

George Swepson in regard to leasing of N. C.
railroads and the issuing of bonds when Holden
was governor, He blames Democrats and Republi-
cans alike for illegal use of funds.

Young Charles C. Holden went to Yale in 1876;

 
Holden, William Woods 17

 

Mary Holden married Claude A Sherwood in these
years; and family visits are frequent.

Republican politics entered the life of Hold-
en in 1881, when -he went to Washington to fight
for his post office appointment.

In Apr. 1882, Governor Holden was seriously
ill, Son Charles wrote from Italy of Italian
social life and customs with emphasis on the
beauty of Italian women. David S, Reid, J. S.
Hampton, and Thos. Randolph Price are correspon-
dents in these years.

In 1885, W. F. Foushee writes concerning the

 
Holden, William Woods 18

 

suit of Josiah Turner, Jr., against Holden,
Turner was a rival, the editor of the Raleigh
Sentinal, arrested in 1870 by Governor Holden,
Many letters by John W. Hinsdale on the case and
its legal expenses are written to both William
and Louisa Holden. Correspondents in the late
1880's include Walter Clark, L. P. Olds, Thos.
Goode Tucker, et al. Governor Holden was still
under political disabilities in these years of
illness,

Young Charles Holden had qualified as a teac
er of modern languages, and his friend Chapman

 
Holden, William Woods

 

Maupin of University School, Asheville, writes
to him. He had his own school in Raleigh. By
1889, he was trying to secure a teaching posi-
tion elsewhere,

The early 1890's are occupied by the Turner
suit. Governor Holden was incapacitated, so
Mrs, Holden acted in his place. John Hinsdale
and John W, Graham are involved. Governor
Holden died in March, 1892. Joseph Holden's
friend, the poet John Boner, writes on Governor
Holden at this time.

The Turner case for judggment is continued

 
Holden, William Woods 20
against Mrs. Holden. George V. Strong, R. H.
Battle, and John Hinsdale are involved in the
last years of the case which finally concluded
in 1894, Turner lost.

William Kenneth Boyd, historian of Trinity
College, began a series of articles on Governor
Holden in 1898. He corresponded with Mary

 

(Holden) Sherwood in regard to family materials
on Holden, Mrs. Sherwood writes that Moore's
account of her father is false; the Wheeler His-
tory, more accurate. In the correspondence, the
relations of Governor Holden with Duncan Cameron

 
Holden, Willaim Woods 21

 

and Dennis Heartt (of the Hillsborough Recorder)
are described, Dr. Boyd was on the track of
Holden incidents as told by Holden's friends and
contemporaries, The friendly letters continue,
referring to a Holden manuscript. In 1903, Boyd
speaks of a N, C. student working in N. C. Reco
struction history he is sending to Mrs. Sherwood

 

(presumably J. G. de Roulhac Hamilton).

Mrs. Sherwood wrote in 1904 to W, R. Henry on
Holden materials. Henry, a brother-in-law, bor-
rowed books and newspapers. Mrs. Sherwood re-
fers to the attacks of Theodore Bryant Kingsbury

 
Holden, William Woods 22

 

(1828-1913) on Governor Holden. Henry wrote on
Sept. 12, 1905, a long denunciation of The Leo-
pard's Spots and The Clansman to their author,
the Reverend Thomas Dixon of Raleigh, a Baptist
minister who had known Governor Holden well.
Holden's achievements for the State are summed
up, the K.K.K. situation in North Carolina re-

 

 

viewed, and a pen picture of Holden by Josephus
Daniels in 1886 quoted. Henry denounces the
picture of Holden in the Dixon novels.

Dr. Boyd continued writing to Mrs. Sherwood.
He was working on the mamuscript of Holden's

 
Holden, William Woods 23

 

memoirs in 1911, when he wrote to her to assure
her that her father's papers were safe. The
Washington Duke Building at Trinity College had
burned. W. R. Henry objected to this publica-
tion of the memoirs. They did not do justice to
Holden, who was ill when he wrote them.

J. G. de Roulhac Hamilton, Josephus Daniels,

and R. W. Haywood are among the later correspon-
dents. In these years the Holden daughters“8til
defending their father from newspaper attacks.
The bills and receipts concern the Raleigh
Standard, personal taxes, and legal fees for the

 
Holden, William Woods 24

 

impeachment and the Josiah Turner lawsuit.

' Legal papers concern Holden's admission to
the N, C. Bar, signed by Thomas Ruffin, land
deeds from Orange Co., the Atlas 0. Harrison es-
tate, appointment of Holden as Director of the
Literary Fund, and various lawsuits.

The printed materials concern Holden's poli-

tical career, the history of N. C., the Metho-

dist Church, various printed copies of original
Holden poetry, proclamations by W. W. Holden as
governor, centering around Reconstruction in N.
C., Andrew Johnson's proclamation of amnesty

 
 

oath, election certificates for Holden as gover-
nor in 1868 signed by Gen. E. R. S. Canby, and
proceedings in the Turner-Holden case.

W. W. Holden wrote his memoirs after 1882,
when he was paralyzed. His daughter evidently
made the final copy for him. This copy in Mary
(Holden) Sherwood's hand is edited in 1911 by

W. K, Boyd, whose typed manuscript is included,
The prose writings of Holden, mostly fragmen-
tary, are copies of editorials from the Standard,
his inaugural address, and manuscripts on Edmund
DeBerry and William Peace. The most important

 
Holden, William Woods 26
MS, is his history of journalism in N, C., cov-
ering such papers as the Raleigh Standard, the
Raleigh Register, the Hillsboro Recorder, the
Raleigh Minerva, and the Raleigh Star, etc.
Many references are made to N. C,. newspapermen:
Thomas LeMay, Edward J. Hale, Francis Xavier
Martin, Joseph Gales, and Dennis Heartt, et al.
Poetry in the collection is by Joseph Wm.
Holden, Laura (Holden) Olds, and Ida (Holden)
Cowles. Many poems from 1838 till the 1880's
are’ from Holden's pen, their themes being mainly

religious.

 

 

 

 

 
Holden, William Woods 27

 

Newspaper clippings are from N. C. papers.
They deal with the history of the Holden's house
in Raleigh, George Swepson's escape from N. C.,
Calvin Cowles, etc.

Louisa V. Holden's scrapbook, dated 1843,
contains clippings of romantic poetry pasted in-
to a Harrison family ledger. On p. 51 is a copy

of a poem, “Home", by Mrs. Holden. A number of
short notes refer to various members of the
Harrison family, relatives of President Wm. H.
Harrison, Louisa lists them (p. 115) as Mary
E. Harrison, Robert Tucker Harrison, Atlas 0,

 
Holden, William Woods 28
Harrison, Wm. Henry Harrison, Charles Anderson
Harrison, and Louisa Virginia Harrison. The led-
ger belonged to a merchant, and those entries not
covered by clippings date between 1820 and 1830.
The merchant operated in Raleigh, for there are
accounts for residents of that city. R. & W.
Harrison was an early mercantile firm of about

 

Raleigh's second decade according to a statement
in M, N. Amis's Historical Raleigh from Its
Foundation: in 1792 with Sketches of Wake County

and Its Important Towns (Raleigh, 1913), p. 68.

 

 

 

 
Holden, William Woods 28-A

The ledger and store probably belonged to one or
more members of the family of Louisa Virginia
(Harrison) Holden.

Among the volumes are a scrapbook of Mary
(Holden) Sherwood's poems and a scrapbook of
clippings on Governor Holden's death. The scrap
book of W. W. Holden dated 1880 contains clip-

 

pings on the history of N. C. journalism and let-
ters by Holden to the newspapers answering criti-
isms. A series of clippings on the history of
Raleigh, 1835-1860, comments on politics, Capt.
ohn Walker, Alfred Dockery, and Moore's Histor
of N. C. W. W. Holden e@ a portrait af

 
Holden, William Woods 29
Wm, Peace to Peace Institute (p. 48). Among
other clippings are the Holden poem describing
John C, Calhoun, Henry Clay's visit to Raleigh
in 1844, and a letter by Wm. Gaston to one of
his law students (pp. 66-68). In 1887, Holden
wrote to the News and Observer on the Secession
Convention of 1861 (p. 92). He also praised
Calvin H. Wiley in 1887 (p. 93).

A letterpress book in 1878- 1879, dates from
Holden's tenure as postmaster of Raleigh. Also
included among the volumes are a history of
Edenton Methodist Church Sunday School and J. G.
de Roulhac Hamilton's °° on

Benjamin Sherwood Hedrick.

The W. W. Holden Ledger (1858-1864) contains
accounts for printing and advertising furnished
by the Raleigh Standard, It is of unusual inte
est in that it deals with the Civil War activi-
ties of the N, C. Executive Dept., the N. C,.
Treasury, the N, C, Literary Board, and the N.C,

 

Adjutant General's Office. C.S.A. advertising
of general orders, for supplies, etc., contain
references to Generals Martin and G. A, Smith.
Many schools and colleges of N. C.--i.e, Trinity
College and the U. of N., C.--appear in the

 
Holden, William Woods_ aha

 

Ledger, as do names of prominent N. C. citizens,
railroads, and banks from all over the state.
(It is well indexed). George W. Swepson of Re-
construction fame is noted in Haw River in the
post office in 1862. The Conscript Office at
Camp Holmes under Major Peter Mallett gave no-
tices and advertised general orders, as did the

General Medical Agent of the N, C. Troops, 0,

An examination in 1964 of lists by the

A. H. A. of dissertations in progress in the

U. S. and Canada revealed two titles for disser-
tations on W. W. Holden. The dissertations
were: Horace Raper, "The Public Career of

officers and civilians on duty with the
Freedmen's Bureau of North Carolina.

Holgate, William C. Papers. Defiance, Defiance
Co., Ohio

 

Papers of Curtis Holgate (1773-1840), his
son William C. Holgate (1814-ca. 1890), and
William's daughter Fannie Maud (Holgate) Harley.
Except for a few letters from William, his brot
er, Jerome Bonaparte, and his sister, Juliett, in

the 1830's, the letters between 1798 and 1852
consist primarily of the business and legal
correspondence of Curtis and William. The let-
ters between 1872 and 1911 are the personal and
family correspondence of Fannie.

 
Holgate, William C. 2
Curtis Holgate was a successful businessman
with commercial interests in Vermont, a salt
works and railroad stocks in New York, and ex-
tensive activity in land speculation in New
York, Indiana, and Ohio. The earlier letters
contain information on his activities in New
York when he lived in Utica, but from the 1830's
onward, they concentrate on his western hold-
ings, particularly those in Napoleon and De--
fiance, Ohio. After the Panic of 1837 until
his death in 1840, Curtis tried desperately to
salvage some of his property in Ohio, where he

 

 
Holgate, William C. 3

 

moved his family in 1838. He was involved in
numerous lengthy lawsuits and was in danger of
being imprisoned at one point.

William C. Holgate first appears in the col-
lection as a student at Hamilton College in
Clinton, N. Y., which he attended from 1831 to

1835. After graduation, he returned home to
Utica to study law but moved to Defiance in
1836 where competition for clients was less
keen. His letters of this period describe in
detail the town and its growth. The panic of

 
Holgate, William C. 4

7 accerbated strained family relations be-
tween the elder Holgate and his sons. William's
early efforts at land development fell through
when his father sold-some land out from under
him in 1838. Jerome had the habit of contract-
ing large debts and then expecting his father
to pay for them. Curtis' nephew and lawyer,
the noted abolitionist Alvan Stewart, advised
him not to give Jerome any more money unless it
was a shilling to buy a rope to hang himself by,
because Jerome was a "bad fellow" (1837, Aug. 7)

 

 
Holgate, William C. S

 

Jerome, on his part, blamed his father for
taking the family to the unhealthy area of De-
fiance and for overextending the family for-
tunes (1838, Oct. 19).

After Curtis' death, William took over his
father's land business while continuing to
build his own law practice and actively promo-
ting the development of Defiance. Letters be-
tween 1840 and 1848 contain information about
improvements such as canals, roads, schools,
churches, and public buildings. Late in 1844,
William lobbied for the formation of New

 
 

Holgate, William C. 6
County (the present Defiance Co., Ohio) with
Defiance as the county seat. One letter (1844,
Dec. 6) includes a map, reasons for the forma-
tion of the county, and political strategy.
Although the county was formed in March, 1845,
it continued to be a point of contention in
local politics between the Whigs and Locofocos

for a year afterwards. By 1852 when this seg-
ment of the collection stops, William was well
on his way to becoming one of the most influen-
tial men in northwestern Ohio.

 
 

Holgate, William CG rs
is part of the collection also contains

information on economic conditions in Ohio and
Mississippi, the abolition and temperance move-
ments, the Presbyterian and Methodist churches,
and the national election of 1840.

After a gap of twenty years, the collection
resumes in 1872, centering around Fannie Maud

Holgate both before and after her marriage to
Perry C. Harley. This segment deals with rou-
tine family matters and gives some idea of the
life of a middle-class family in the Victorian

 
Holgate, William C.

Era. Topics of interest include: birth control
abortions, a smallpox epidemic, life in various
female academies, descriptions of California
and Colorado, and the election of 1884.

The collection also contains financial pa-
pers between 1819 adn 1857, though most fall
in the 1830's and 1840's. They contain bills
and receipts of both a personal and business
nature for the Holgate family.

Sketch.

Miss Mary Hollingsworth left Harper's Ferry
for a trip west to Cincinnati. Her comments
are pleasantly social about scenery, people she
met, the Ohio Reform School Farm, the Shaker
village near Lebanon, Ohio (pp. 75-80), social
and religious life in 1860 and the Quakers of
Richmond, Indiana. The diary is incomplete; a
second volume evidently has been lost.

Hollister, Seth. Papers, 1860-1865.
Washington, Litchfield Co., Conn.

This collection consists principally of
letters addressed to Seth Hollister, who
apparently was a farmer in Connecticut. His
cousins Fritz G. and Lewis Hollister served
in the 8th Regiment of Connecticut Volunteers
during the Civil War. Their letters and the
other soldiers’ letters illustrate the reasons
why many young men elected to volunteer for
military service. The Hollisters intensely
disliked war as an instrument of national

 

 
Hollister, Seth. 2
policy. They justified their participation
in war, however, by recognizing that their
goals of justice and freedom could be attained
in this situation only by the use of force.
An unidentified friend wrote a letter on
Feb. 2, 1860, to Seth Hollister from Hancock,
N.Y. He described Delaware County, N.Y., and

 

the neighboring areas in Penn. He also noted
the tanning and coal mining industries in
these states.

The Civil War letters include many descrip-

 
Hollister, Seth. e.
tions of life at the Annapolis training center
and at camps in N.C. and Va... Fritz Hollister
was detailed for several months to work at
Trinity Hospital in Washington, D.C. He dis-
cussed his work in a letter of Nov. 21, 1862.
On Apr. 29, 1861, a cousin, Jennie, wrote
from Northropville, Ohio. She described the

 

rough treatment given to a "copperhead"
residing in her town.

In a letter dated only March 30, the town
of New Bern, N.C., is described by a Northern

 
Hollister, Seth. 4
soldier recuper2ting at the Craven Street
Hospital in that captured city.

Individuals discussed in these letters
include George B. McClellan, Robert Gould
Shaw, and Winfield Scott. The writers also
commented extensively on slavery, war, their
life in the Army, and the attitude and
situation of Negroes who had escaped from
or been released by their masters.

sponded with Holman and remembers her each year
with a Christmas card and note. In January 1983
a Christmas card and note to Holman with her
accompanying card and note to Mattie U. Russell
were added to the Holman Papers.

 

When the Hubbell Center was established, Dr.
Hubbell asked Professor Holman to write a
sketch of Professor Rayburn Moore to be placed
in the Center's collection. In July 1983
Holman added that sketch, vitae of Rayburn and

 
Holman, Harriet Rejmma

Margaret Moore, and five letters. In August
Holman sent a corrected copy of the sketch
asking that the first one be discarded.
Accompanying this sketch were letters from Moore
and one from E. M. Lander, Jr., a member of the
Clemson University history faculty, which refers
to a book he had just written about the Clemson-

 

Calhoun families. Also in August were added two
letters--one Hubbell's letter to Holman and the
other a letter to Hubbell from Roland W. Nelson
concerning Edgar Allan Poe' Eureka.

 
Holman, Harriet Rem - 9
A clipping from the
Mail for September 11, 1983, was added in
September... The clipping is an article written
by Mark Sidney Steadman which gives his
impressions of Russians during the winter of
1983 and their impressions of Americans. Stead-
man was a Fulbright lecturer to Russia.

 

 

On October 5, 1983, Holman added to her papers
a letter from Guy Davenport, Jr., dated July 9,
1945, concerning a scrapbook of his drawings
and newspapers articles which he sent to her to
show to Professor Newman Ivey White, a copy of

White's reply to Davenport pertaining to
financial assistance available to him at Duke,
two letters to Holman from Hubbell concerning a
position in New Jersey, an application for a
Fulbright lectureship, and an accompanying

letter from Holman relating the background of
the Davenport material.

On April 15, 1986, nine items were added
to the Holman Papers. They included a picture
of Thomas Nelson and Florence Lathrop Page and
four young men, four letters and a card from
Jay B. Hubbell discussing his chapter on Poe

Joseph G. E&. Holman (d. 1892), farmer,
lived for some years at Ft. Wayne, Indiana,
but resided for many years thereafter in
Preble County, Ohio. In 1856 he married
Catharine Wehrley (1838-1915). His parents were
Joseph Holman (1788-1873) and Lydia (Qverman)
Holman (1792-1854), and his grandfather was
George Holman (1762-1854), an early settler of
Kentucky and Indiana whose exploits are
recorded in David Emory Holman, The Holmans in
America . .. (New York, 1909), I, xl-xli.

 

 

 
Holman, Joseph G. &. 2

 

A small, unbound diary records Holman's
work on the construction of the Fort wayne and
Southern Rail Roadduring 1853-1854 and his
participation in gold mining in Colorado
during 1862-1863. A bound diary of 1883-1886
concerns his life as a farmer in Preble County.
A third volume was a notebook for vocabulary

study. Holman kept meticulous daily records
of the places that he visited, and these
diaries are rather like charts with comment on
various activities and events scattered

through them.

 
Holman, Joseph G. E. 3
During 1853-1854,the Fort Wayne and Southern
Rail.Road Company was preparing its route south-
ward from Ft. Wayne to Jeffersonville, Indiana
(across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky
via Muncie, New Castle, Rushville, and North
Vernon. Holman worked along the whole line -
as a rodsman during March-August, 1853, and as

 

a leveler thereafter until February, 1854.
Ownership of this rail line is now divided (at
Rushville) between the New York Central System
and the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad
(the Nickel Plate Road).

 
Holman, Joseph G. E. 4

The discovery and mining of gold opened
Colorado to settlement during 1858-1861, and the
region became the Colorado Territory in the
latter year. Joseph G. E. and W. J. Holman
joined in the search for gold. Diary entries
of April, 1862, to March, 1864, record Joseph
Holman's trips to and from Colorado and his
work there at a mine in Poor Man's Gulch.
Places mentioned include Tarryall, Montgomery,
Trail Creek, Gregory, and Junction. The mine
was apparently in Park County.

The bound diary of April, 1833, to October,

 

 
Holman, Joseph G. &. &

1886, is useful for the local history of Preble
County. Farming operations and a variety of
local events were noted. The Holmans joined

the Church of the Brethren at Price's Creek in
1884. This denomination and one that separated
from it, the Old Order Brethren (or Old Order
Dunkers or Dunkards) were mentioned often.

There is information on the Holman and Wehrley
families. Price's Creek Church and the wehrleys
are noted in the History of the Church of the
Brethren of the Southern District of Ohio by the
Historical Committee (Dayton, 1920), pp. 175-18

as George Ephriam. He has been recorded in the

Abiel Holmes (1763-1837) was born in Connec-
ticut and educated at Yale University. After
being graduated, he studied theology and went
in 1785 to Liberty County, Ga., to serve the
Midway Congregational Church there. In 1790,

he married Mary Stiles, the daughter of the
president of Yale, Ezra Stiles. He went to
Cambridge, Mass., as pastor of a church in 1792

and remained until his retirement in 1832.

 
Holmes, Abiel 2
After his first wife had died in 1795, he mar-
ried Sarah Wendell in 1800 and had five children
by her, one of them being the poet and author
Oliver Wendell Holmes. Abiel Holmes also wrote
extensively, and his study of American history,
Annals of America, became a standard work.

On January 31, 1820, Holmes wrote to an un-

 

 

identified recipient to acknowledge a gift from
his former parishoners to the American Education
Society, an organization he had helped establish,

He also commented on various people connected

with the Midway church, including its minister
at the time, the Rev. Murdock Murphy, Jr.
Several accounts of the church have been pub-
lished, among them being James Stacy's History

HOLMES, George Frederick. Letters and Papers
Charlottesville, Va. Historical Sketch.
1767-1901 . s

 

George Frederick Holmes (Aug. 2, 1090 - Nov.
4, 1897) was born in Demerera, British Guiana,

the son of Joseph Henry Hefndon Holmes and Mary
Ann (Pemberton) Holmes. At an early age he was

taken to England where he lived with relatives
and was educated. A misunderstanding with his
guardians caused him to leave the University of
Durham and come to Canada in 1837. He traveled
southward and in 1842 was living in South Care
lina where he studied law and was admitted to

 
Holmes, George Frederick Sketch (2)

 

the bar, though he never practiced. On Feb. 3, 1845,
he married Eliza Lavalette Floyd, daughter of Gov.
John Floyd and Letitia Preston. Their children were:
Isabel, Letty Preston, Henry H., and Frederick Laurence
Holmes. The latter was an attorney. He is buried in
Surry County. George Frederick Holmes, Jr., was his
son. (See: N.J. Floyd, Biog. Generals of the Va.-Ky.
Floyd Families, 1912.)

From 1845 to 1847 Holmes was principal of
Richmond College (Wa.). During that time Mrs.
Holmes remained with her mother at Burke's Gar-
den, in western Virginia. In Feb., 1847, Holmes

 

 

 
Holmes, Geo. Frederick Sketch es
was appointed professor at William and Mary
College. A year later (January 22, 1848) he re+
Signed due to dissension among the Board of
Visitors. The difficulty was smoothed over, and
in July Holmes was re-instated. But in Aug.,
1848, he was elected President of the newly
organized (Go to next card ,)

 

 
Holmes, George Frederick, Sketch (4)
University of Miss. He was there for a short
time and made the inaugural address. Shortly
thereafter Holmes' own severe illness and that
of his family necessitated his return to Va.
where he remained for several months. Meanwhile
the Board of Trustees dismissed him. This caused
considerable controversy, in which Holmes sought
his own vindication.

Thereafter he remained for several years at
Burke's Garden, Va., during which his chief oc-
sree ncn was writing for various journals. In
1856 he was offered a position in a girl's
school conducted by Basil Manly, Jr., at Rich-
mond, but did not ac & cept.

 

 
Holmes, George Frederick, Sketch (5)

His real opportunity came in 1857 when he was
elected to the professorship of History and Gen-
eral Literature in the University of Virginia.
Here he remained until his death forty years
later. Mrs. Holmes died in Sept., 1887,

Holmes was throughout his life hounded by
poverty and debt, which at various periods nec-
essitated Mrs. Holmes! living with her mother.
In spite of Holmes' domestic worries, he turned
out a prodigious amount of literary work of a
distinctly learned nature. His interests covered
almost every phase of liberal arts, with es-
pecial attention to philology, grammar, history,

 

 
Holmes, George Frederick. Sketch (6)
political science, and economics. He correspond
ed with many of the leading literary men and
educators of the South. He remained at the Univ
of Va. throughout the Civil War, while his
family apparently lived chiefly at Burke's Gar-
den.

The collection consists of letters, works,

 

notes, and bound volumes(containing both works
and notes. The letters, partly family, and
partly literary, reveal his vital concern for
his wife and children, his authoritative know-
ledge of many subjects, and his contfimversies
with boards of trustees. The works include

 
Holmes, George Frederick iz
many of his articles written for periodicals, and part
of his books. The notes include those made for college
lectures and for his own use. The bound volumes contain
notes, works, and diaries. The amount of material bears

witness to the extent of Holmes' scholarship and the
amazing volume of work and writing that he accomplished.
Included in this collection also are papers of

 

Joseph Henry Hendon Holmes, Mary Ann (Pemberton) Holmes,
and Stephen Pemberton. Joseph Henry Hendon Holmes was a
barrister of Demerara British Guiana. His papers consist
of treatises on contracts and exchange of money, fragments

 
Holmes, George Frederick 8
of poetry, poems, his will, and pictures. Among
the papers of Mary Ann (Pemberton) Holmes are
the following: a.brief record of her life in
Demerara with interesting comments on the people
and the country: ate oe history and genealogy,
personal lettersfépitaphs. There are verses of
Stephen Pemberton written while he was attend-

 

ing Oriel College, Oxford, England,

2 items added, 3-13-52. These consist of a
letter written by Joseph LeConte at the Univ.
of Cal. on Sug. 9, 1875, and its accompanying
exnvelope. He states that he and his brother
have recommended Holmes for a professorship of

 
Holmes, George Frederick 9
history there should such a professorship be
established,

18 items added, 8-7-54. These consist of
a series of lectures delivered at the Univ. of
Virginia in 1883. The lectures discuss various
aspects of ancient civilization, such as man
and his surroundings, climate, topography, soil,

 

archaeology, language, domestic animals, plants,
marriage and the family, the tribe and tribal
relations, government, customs, and law. Of
particular interest is the introductory lecture
on historical science and "History and Social
Development." This reflects the views of Comte

 
Holmes, George Frederick 10
on sociology and shows considerable interest in
the field of political economy.

7 items added, 6-3-55. They are as follows:
(1) Lectures Two through Thirteen of "Science
of Society" and abstract of notes on the first
six lectures of that work; 92) outlines of lec-
tures on "Historical Science" and "History and
Social Development"; and (3) three pages of

fragments of his writings.
na volume entitled, "Excerpts from Various

Books, University of Virginia, 1853-1888"

(Vol. 1803), p. 49, Holmes suggests that he is
desirious of destroying his writings on theology
which mo longer repre - sent his views on the
subject,

 

 
Holmes, George Frederick 11
As to the letters from James Henley Thornwell
to George F. Holmes and from Holmes to Thornwell
that appear in Holmes' Letterbook, 1835-1874,
and B. M. Palmer, The Life and Letters of James
Henley Thornwell, some of them show deletions
in one place that do not appear in the other,
and some are quoted more fully in one place than
in the other, For that reason the two volumes
should be used simultaneously.

2 items added, 4-8-83: Letter of Nov. 28,
1844, from Benjamin Blake Minor, editor of the
Southern Literary Messenger, to George F.
Holmes, who was then in Orangeburg, South
Carolina. Minor writes about Holme$’s con-
tributions to the Messenger. He mentions the
favorable comments on an article by Holmes on

 

periodical literature that were made by Joseph
R. Chandler and Nathaniel P. Willis. He goes
on both to praise and to critize Willis's

writings.

 
Holmes, George Frederick L3-
Minor asks Holmes to assist him by pointing
out what he sees as deficiencies of the
Messenger, and to send him a list of people
whose writings would add "greater variety and
amusement" to the Messenger. He goes on to
describe the kinds of lively writing he is
seeking for the magazine, determined, it appears
from an additional statement, to try to counter
act somewhat Northern criticism of Southern
writing. He asks if Mrs. Elizabeth Fries
(Lummis) Ellet and Miss Mary Lee of Charleston

 

 
Holmes, George Frederick 14

 

would answer the purpose he had mentioned. He
mentions the compliment the Southern Quarterly
Review had paid him about one DeLeon's tract
on Mormonism and says he is glad the Southern
Quarterly is now established.

The second item is a series of genealogical

 

notes eepikes copied from old, deteriorating
records by N. Floyd Holmes of Fort Pierce,
Fla., a grandson of George F. Holmes. If the
original records were dated, that fact is not

shown on the copies.

Charleston, South Carolina. Sketch. 13 pieces
Isaac Edward Holmes was born in Charleston,
8.C., April 6,1796 and died there Feb. 24,1867.
He was prepared for college boy his cousin,
Christopher E. Gadsden, and graduated at Yale in
1815, was admitted to the bar in Charleston in
1818 and became a successful lawyer. He entered

 

the legislature in 1826 and during the nullifi-
Cation crisis of 1832-33 was a leader of the
extreme state-rights party, and one of the
founders of the South Carolina association. The

proposition that the state should nullify the

 
Holmes, Isaac Edward Sketch (2)

tariff first emanated from him. In 1838 he was
sent to Yongress andwas an active member of the
house till 1850, serving as chairman of the
committee on commerce, and afterward of that on
naval affairs. He then removed to California,
and practiced law from 1851 till January, 1861,
when on learhing of the passage of the ordinance

 

of secession, he returned to South Carolina. He
passed through Washington, and, in several inte
views with W.H.Seward and Winfield Scott, en-

deavored to avert war. After the close of
hostilities he was appointed a commissioner of

 
Holmes, Isgac Edward Sketch (3)

the state to confer with the Federal Government.
He was the author of the Recreation of George
Taletell, consisting of stories, essays, and
descriptive sketches (Charleston 1822), and, in
conjunction with Robert J. Turnbull, published
a volume of political essays in favor of state
rights, under the signature of "Caroliniensis"

 

 

(1826).

The letters of this collection were writteh
while he was a member of Congress and gre
recommendations and requests for political app-
ointments. The collection contains little mat-
erial of intrinsic “6

This set is for the most part comprised of
rather personal letters of the Holmes family
of Laurens, 5. ©. The father, 2. L.. Holmes,
was a professor at Presbyterian College,
Clinton, 8S. C., from which he obtained only a
small financial benefit. Evidently he also did
some preaching which added little to his
financial state, which appeared to be rather
poor. Nickels J. Holmes was evidently the

youngest of three sons, A. R. Holmes, one of
the sons, was evidently a preacher. Joseph

Austin Holmes, the third son, was a professor
of Agriculture at Cornell University, and
later professor of Geology and Botany at the
University of North Yarolina, He was reputed
to have been most influential in getting Con-
gress to establish a United States Bureau of
Mines, according to an article in the Chicago
Evening Post, Feb. 28, 1916. (See Dictionary
of American Biorgaphy, IX, 167.) There were
at least two daughters in the family,-.Ada and
Abbie, whose letters to Nickels while the
latter was away at school display keen

family devotion.

Nickels was sent to acquire his education at
the University of Edinburgh immediately after t
Close of the Civil War. The family letters indi-
cate the financial struggles of the father to
keep Nickels in school, with much of the

 

expense being taken care of by Shipping part of
the family cotton crop to a commission merchant,
Vans Randall, in Liverpool, England, who trans-

ferred the funds derived from the Sale to
Nickels. Financial aid was obtained at times

by Nickels from his Uncle, Joseph E. Holmes in
London, who was a Civil and Mechanical engineer.
The family exchange of letters, during the
period 1866-71, indicates such things as the
poor crops in the South following the Civil War
and the resultant westward movement, the social

 

activities of the younger set, the deep religias
feelings prevalent in. some of the families, the
ideas on education suited for a college boy, the
attitude toward reconstruction, etc,

sequence of his career. It appears that at an
early date after his return to America he served
as a High School principal. In 1874 he was the
Chairman of the Executive committee of the
Conservative Party, and about the same time he
was appointed Commissioner of Elections... He

 

was admitted to the bar and became the partner
of H. Y. Simpson, and was. at one time an

associate justice of a circuit court. In 1888
he gave up his legal practice and went into the

that he had the makings of a very successful
preacher,

There are several letters of importance
which should be indicated. The letter of J. W.
Jackson, dune 7, 1845, indicates the existence
of a Historical Society, evidently in Savannah,
Ga. A letter of Joseph E. Holmes, August 29,

 

1866, reveals the attitude of an Englishman on
the South and the negro problem, Holmes
stated that he regretted that the negro problem

arose, but added that since it had it was up to

HOLMES, Nickels J. -7= Sketch

the gouth to recognize the negroes as equal to
the whites before the eyes of the law and that
the South shouldn't try to retaliate against the
negroes, There are several excellent letters of
Joseph A, Holmes while he was professor of
Agriculture at Cornell, describing in detail
various agricultural procedures, such as the

 

preservation of ensilage, the construction of a
silo etc.

There are also various legal papers included

in the set, as well as several examinations
which give an idea of the educational methods

ing Expedition commanded by Charles Wilkes

 
 

3-18 During this expedition, which con-
tinued from 1838 to 1842, Holmes served on
board the Peacock. When the squadron arrived at
Sydney, Australia, he was transferred to the

Porpoise to replace Dr. Guillou, In his pub-
Tished Autobiography, Wilkes praised the doctor
highly for his devotion to duty and cheerful

disposition, Wilkes commented, "He [Holmes]
was one of the most useful and energetic of-
ficers of the Squadron. . . . I had not under
my command a more reliable officer." On

recommendation is also endorsed by Benjamin —

recommendation may have’ been used for that
voyage.

John-C. Hood, evidently a farmer with
relatives in Johnston Co., Meadow Township, N.C
had a large family of children who became
involved in the Civil War. Most of the letters
in this collection were written by B.R. (Bob or

Robert) Hood, who was drafted early in 1862, and
eventually became a member of Co. D, 24th North
Carolina Regiment. His brother, David W. Hood,
and his wife, Martha, were living at Snow Hill
when David entered the 67th Regiment of North

 
Hood, John C. z
Carolina troops.

The letters have the usual comments on camp
life and food. References are made to deserters
(Aug. 26, 1862); the second battle at Manassas
(Sept. 6, 1862); the possibility of hiring a
substitute (1863); skirmishing around New Bern,
N.C., Feb. and Mar., 1863, and Feb., 1865;

 

unnamed fighting in N.C. in 1863; fighting
around Winchester, Va. (July 17, 1863); the fal
of Vicksburg (July 9, 1863); and skirmishes in
Vae

B.R. Hood wrote letters from Camp Holmes,

 
Hood, John C. 3
near Raleigh, when he entered the service in
1862. He he was enrolled in the Camp Guards
and so remained until he entered Co. D., 24th
N-eCe, in March, 1863. Moore's Roster of N.C.
Troops lists him as enlisting, but actually he
was drafted and then given a choice of a
regiment.

There is some confusion about the address of
John C. Hood. Evidently he lived in Meadow
Township, Johnston Co., but did receive mail at
Draughons's Store, Sampson Co., for a short time

during the war.

 

 
Hood, John C. 4

5 items added, 3-21-61, are miscellaneous
papers belonging to John C. Hood. A letter
dated Feb. 5, 1862, from son David W. Hood
comments on the operation of a still in Snow
Hill.

24 items added, 4-3-67, concern the accounts
of John C. Hood as assistant quartermaster of

 

Meadow fPowhship, Johnston Coe, in charge of
official aid to families of Confederate Soldiers.
A committee was set up by the court for
Johnston Co. in May, 1861. John C. Hood's
papers give names of committee members, amounts

Of money paid out for relief, names of the
soldiers' families, and corn and meat supplies
held by each family, 1862-1864. Soldiers of Co.

the relief lists.

The various members of the Hood family are
named throughout the papers, so that there is

This suit, begun about 1791, was instituted
by David Ross who had become Hook's partner
in a mercantile firm in 1771, with Ross aé-

porter of goods as well as exporter from Wil-

his main store was located at New London in
Campbell County, and during that period and
probably later, he operated a store at Bedford
Court House and another known as the Falling

to Hale's Ford (often spelled Hailsford),

Court House. Here he operated a store, a

of Bowker Preston and Smithson H. Davis, seem-

mercantile establishments at Hale's Ford and at
Germantown both in Franklin County, Virginia.

shatowed by the records pertaining to the se-
questwation proceedings instituted by David
Ross. This suit remained in the Courts from
1791 until 1850, long after the death of both
principals. Hook's unpopularity was undoubted-
ly based on his close trading and numerous sui
ts which he brought against his debtors after
the Revolutionary War while the latter were
unable to achieve any financial security be-
cause of a disturbed state of currency and

by Hook consisting of a schedule of court days
in the various counties of Virginia, lists

of debtors, the security of their debts, de-
tailed records of their places of abode cover-
ing many counties in Virginia and listing some
in other states, and lists of the exchange
rates of Spanish and French gold. A letter
from David Ross, who early in the War was also
suspected of being a Tory (Va. Mag. of Hist,
and Biog.) to Hook on April 26, 1783 expressed

surprise at the continuance of animosity be-

(Ross) had earlier considered this animosity
as the effects of differences in political be-

wrote further that he vipon frty that you

might better have advised with his partner
before bringing such suits. Ross also stated
that many people were indésperate straits and
that two or three years should be allowed to
elapse before suits were brought,

Jydetng from William Writ's life of Pat-
rick Henry, Hook's unpopularity was greatly
increased by notority gained in his suit a-

Patrick Henry, appearing for Venable excited
great indignation against Hook telling of the
hungry and almost naked army marching to tri-
umph and glory only to be met by John Hook's
hoarse cry of "béef!" This trial, held in the
district court of New London (Wirt, Patrick
Henry p.309) was doubtless a factor in Hook's
removal to Hale's Ford.

By 1790 Hook was well established at Hale's
Ford, but with the sequestration proceedings

started by David Ross in 1791, his life

trips to Richmond, hired such lawyers as James

tempted to obtain William R, Davie. After his

Va., including some areas included in West

Va. since its  @ to the Union as a

State (1863). While the collection has little

value, some of the narratives in it throw a
little light on the fighting in 1862, as seen
from the Southern side. There are several
miscellaneous items, including an insignifi-
cant letter dated 1877. The letters show

Southern enthusiasm at the beginning of the
Civil War, hardships during it, accounts from
invaded areas, and commodity shortages. Col.
Hooke, in a letter dated July 11, 1861, states
that Southern women, if they could get at

Robert W. Hooke, in a letter written sometime

McClellan. and Robert Patterson, of the U. 8.
Army; Beauregard; and the prelude to the lst

 

Battle of Manassas (1861). An unsigned frag-
mentary letter dated July 3, 1862, probably
by William Franklin Hooke, discusses the
Seven Days' Battle (1862).

Tuscaloosa Co., Alabama

 

William Stanley Hoole, librarian, educator,
and author, was born May 16, 1903, in Darling-
ton, South Carolina, the son of William Brunson
Hoole, a pharmacist, and Minnie Eva (Powers)
Hoole. He attended St. John's Academy where

his grandfather had once taught. As a high
school student he was outstanding in scholastic,
social, and athletic activities. He played
both football and baseball and ran the 100 yard
dash. Upon graduation from high school he

 
Hoole, William Stanley

 

entered Wofford College, Spartanburg, South
Carolina, presumably to prepare for the study
of medicine, but medicine was abhorrent to him
and he opted for a teaching career receiving hig
A.B. in 1924. That fall he became teacher of
English and coach of football at Spartanburg

High School. After a year of teaching he was
lured into business by a local cotton mill sup-
ply house, but in 1926 he left Montgomery-
Crawford Company to accept a more lucrative
position with the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Com-

pany in Charlotte, North Carolina. He never

 
Hoole, William Stanley 2

 

gave up his interest in teaching and learning,
so in the summer of 1927 he left Goodyear and
began work toward a masters degree in English
at the University of South Carolina. That fall
he returned to Darlington, S.C., where he re-
mained as teacher of English and athletic dir-

ector at St. John's Academy until 1931. Mean-
while he attended summer school at Columbia
University and Wofford College in order to con-
tinue work on his masters degree which he re-
ceived in the summer of 1931 from Wofford

College. That same ‘é@ he married Martha

 
Hoole, William Stanley 4

 

Anne Sanders, a teacher of mathematics at St.
John's Academy.

Upon the recommendation of Jay B. Hubbell
whom Hoole had met at Columbia, he applied for
and received a teaching fellowship at Duke
University where in 1934 he received his doc-
torate.

In the summer of 1934 Dr. Hoole accepted a
position as Assistant Professor of English at
Birmingham-Southern College, Birmingham, Ala-
bama. From 1934 to 1937 Hoole planned to write
for the Birmingham Post a series of short

 

 
Hoole, William Stanley 5
articles dealing with outstanding Southern au-
thors. His correspondence with Sara Henderson
Hay, Virginia Sorenson, Stark Young, Paul Green
among others asked each one his/her plans for
the immediate future with reference to writing,
his/her ideas of the "rebirth" in Southern lit-
erature, and his/her philosophy of writing.

 

Although the series was never completed the
correspondence remains. In the spring of 1935
the college received a Carnegie Corporation
grant to upgrade its library and another from
the Rockefeller Foundation which enabled Hoole

 
Hoole, William Stanley 6

 

to serve as Professor of Books and Director of
the M. Paul Phillips Library. Under the Rocke-
feller grant Hoole attended the summer sessions
of the University of Chicago Graduate School of
Library Science. In the fall of 1937 Hoole be-
came Librarian and Instructor in English at

Baylor University, Waco, Texas, where he stayed
until 1939 when he was appointed Head Librarian
and Director of the Department of Library Ser-
vice at North Texas State Teachers College.
Everywhere he went he instigated new improve-
ment and expansion policies. He also wrote for

 
Hoole, William Stanley vs
numerous publications, both professional and
literary, performed on radio and the lecture
circuit. In August 1944 Hoole left Texas and
settled at the University of Alabama as Direc-
tor of Libraries. There he remained. He has
written, besides professional surveys and ar-
ticles, several books based on his interest in

 

southern literature, history, and folklore.
Among them are Sam Slick in Texas (1944), The
Ante-Bellum Charleston Theatre (1946), Alias
Simon Suggs: The Life and Times of Johnson Jones

Hooper (1952), The James Boys Rode South (1955),

The collection centers around the papers of
the brig Mars and the correspondence of John
Hoomes. The brig Mars, commanded by Captain
Thomas, evidently ran between Portsmouth and

Richmond, Va. The cargoes included negroes,
rum molasses, flour, beef, cloth, and sundry
articles. The accounts are interesting in

that they give some idea as to wages, the
number needed to man a boat, and the food and

equipment given to the men. Among the papers
is the correspondence of Zachary Rowland, mer-
chant at Portsmouth, who evidently received the
goods sent down by Richard Nestor from Hoods,Va.
John Hoomes, tabacco merchant of 4owling
Green, Caroline Younty, was a follower of
John Taylor and John Baylar in his enthusiasm
for fine horses. Much of his correspondence
deals with the purchase of horses from England.

He purchased Draggon for # 300, but on the

arrival of the horse he was somewhat disappoint
ed. By the close of his life (1810),Hoomes real
ized to his sorrow that horse racing and breéd-
ing Was moving westward. There are numerous let
ters from Hoomes to Lamb and Younger of London
to whom he sold tobacco and from whom he bought
woolen and cotton cloth,linen,and other manufac

tured articles. A great deal is revealed as to
the price and quality of Va.tobacco,the general
condition of the market,and the difficulties of
transportation. The Napoleonie Wars seriously
affected trade. Ships were captured,goods con-
fiscated,and the Dutch tobacco market cut off.

 
Hoomes, John, Sketch. (4)

 

Hoomes had a fairly large business,for in 1800
he sent his son,John,to England to look after
business interests as well as to buy horses.
The collection is both interesting as well as
valuable as it reveals a great deal as to the
early development of trade and commerce,the re-
lations between the English and American mer-

chants, the effects of the European war on the
markets, and the interest of Virginians in
horse raising.

She comments to Mr. Reese that "There are

for the old fashioned English poetry." She
also says that she thinks Mr. Bryant's "The

Theodore Roosevelt Hornberger, educator,
lecturer, and writer, was born January 13, 1906,
in Northville, Michigan. He died at the age of
69, March 14, 1975, in Minneapolis, Minnesota,
where he was a visiting professor in the English
Department of the University of Minnesota.

Hornberger received his B.S. degree from the
University of Michigan in 1927. After spending
a year at Kings College, University of London,

 
Hornberger, Theodore (1906-1975) 2
England, as an Inglis Foreign Fellow, he began
his teaching career as an instructor in English
at Michigan in 1928. In 1934 he received from
Michigan his doctorate in American literature
having earned in 1929 his M.A. He was appointed
an assistant professor of English at Michigan in
1936 and became a research fellow of the

 

Huntington Library the same year. In 1937 he
was accorded the unusual recognition of an
appointment to a full professorship in American
literature at the University of Texas in Austin.

 
Hornberger, Theodore (1906-1975)

In 1946 Hornberger left Texas to accept a
professorship at the University of Minnesota
where from 1950 to 1958 he served as chairman of
the Department of English. Hornberger's final
move was to the University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1960. He was
appointed John Welsh Centennial Professor of

 

History and English literature in 1968 and held

that position until he retired in 1974.
Professor Hornberger is best known for his

work in the American colonial period, notably

 
Hornberger, Theodore (1906-1975)

 

in the area of the history of ideas and more
specifically of scientific ideas. He spent most
of his teaching life working on producing a
study of Puritanism and science. Twice he sub-
mitted manuscripts to publishers only to have
first the depression then World War II prevent
their being published. He began a third manu-
script on Puritanism and science but died before
finishing it.

Although frustrated at getting his life's
work in print, Hornberger did write other works

 
Hornberger, Theodore (1906-1975) 5

 

that were published. Among them are Scientific
Thought in American Colleges, 1638-1800 (1945),
Benjamin Franklin (1962), Mark Twain's Letters
to Will Bowen (1941), and William Cullen Bryant
and Isaac Henderson (1950). Along with Walter
Blair and Randall Stewart he edited in 1966 The

 

 

 

 

 

Literature of the United States. Earlier with
Walter Blair, Paul Farmer, and others, he edited
The United States in Literature (1963). He also
was the author of many scholarly journal arti-

cles.

 

 

 
Hornberger, Theodore (1906-1975)

 

Over the years Professor Hornberger was
visiting lecturer at a number of universities
including Harvard, Northwestern, Duke, Ohio
State, and Colorado. In 1952 he was Visiting
Professor of North American Literature at the
University of Brazil. In 1956 Hornberger was
elected chairman of the American Literature

Group of MLA; in 1967 he was appointed as a
Fellow of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
Foundation, and in the fall of 1973 he was
chosen Thord-Gray Visiting Lecturing Fellow to

 
Hornberger, Theodore (1906-1975) 7
Uppsala University by the American-Scandanavian
Foundation.

The Hornberger papers consist mainly of
fragments of lectures, articles, and his un-
finished third manuscript of "Puritanism and
Science" along with notes and bibliographies,
records of research, reprints of a few Hornberge

 

articles, four articles written by others, a

news release at the time of his death, biblio-
graphies of his works and works pertaining to the
subjects of his lectures, and copies of two

Thomas Hartwell Horne (1780-1862), British
Biblical scholar, bibliographer, and polemic,
wrote an Introduction to the Critical Study
and Knowledge of “the Holy Scriptures (1818)
that received wide e acceptance and passed
through many editions. The tenth edition (1856)
included a work by Dr. Samuel Davidson entitled
The Text of the Old Testament Considered which
aroused considerable controversy. Horne's
letter of Nov. 19, 1856, concerns the criticism

of this edition.

These are the letters and Papers of Jas. H.

sisting chiefly of Civil War letters between

just ppior to the war, James Horner was a school
teacher in Oxford, but with the beginning of
Hostilities he entered the Confederate Service
as a captain in the 13th Regt. N.C, Vols.; it is

Hugh G. Horton was a lawyer in Williamston,
N.C. and was elected as a Lemocrat to re-
present Martin County in the North Carolina
House of Representatives. He later served
in the State Senate.

His papers consist principally of corre-
spondence exchanged with Joseph Isaac Byrum,
Ssr., a minor poet wnom Horton had represented
in a legal case. Written in 1939, these
letters contain little substance other than

 
Horton, Hugn G., Papers. 2
Byrum's repeated protestations of innocence
and his efforts to regain his driver's li-
cence. Clyde R. Hoey is mentioned as a pos-
sible recourse to whom Horton could turn to
nelp Byrum. A&4 poem is attached to a letter
of July 17, 1939.
Other items include a copy of the plat-

 

form adopted by the vVemocratic Party in 1942
and a letter from J. Henry Hill, Jr. urging
Horton to support a bill in the State Senate.
Hill was a district chairman in Hickory for
the Young Democratic Clubs of North Carolina.

The volume is entitled "Card Album and Scrapbook."
It contains a large number of greeting cards and
stickers, many of them exceedingly handsome. Some are
embossed,

One card bears the handwritten notation, "Mary

J. Horton, 1882." It is the only such notation on

the book or on any of the cards. Two cards have printed
dates, 1880 and 1881, and the others appear to belong to
this time. It is quite possible that Mary J. Horton was

 
Horton, Mary J.
the compiler and/or owner of the book.

It is unclear whether or not the cards are
all American. Some of them, or many of them may
be of English or European manufacture. One card
pictures a postcard with an English stamp. Only
a few cards bear the names of manufacturers:

I, Prang & Co., Boston; Mayer, Merkel & Ottmann,
New York; and Thomas W. Price Co.

The cards include some for Christmas, the

New Year, Easter, Valentine's Day, and for

birthdays. Others are religious, humorous

 

 
Horton, Mary J. ‘3
or express sentiments such as love, friendship,
remembrance, etc. They depict men, women,
children, flowers, animals, insects, etc. A
number of the Christmas and New Year cards are
examples of the use of spring or summer scenes
instead of seasonal winter scenes, a trait of
some 19th and early 20th century cards.

Many cards in this volume are what is known
as album cards of which a description can be
found in J. R. Burdicks's The American Card

Catalog.

have also been identified by type in

and other members of his family, which often

The narrative begins with mention of Gen.
Samuel Houston, a cousin, Mrs. Enfield believes,
of Christopher Houston. The Houstons migrated
from the lowlands of Scotland to Ulster, North
Ireland, because they had been persecuted for
their Presbyterianism. Christopher's father,

John or John Robert, for religious reasons,
decided to emigrate to. America in 1734. He
sailed on a British ship, the Sparrow Hawk,
commanded by an ex-pirate, who had supposedly.

reformed. Together with others, John mutinied,
took charge of the ship, and arrived in Boston.
From thence he went to Philadelphia, where he
married Martha Worke. Some time later they went
to Lancaster. They had eight children, including
Christopher, who went to Ft. Dobbs, N. C., in
1765.and married Sarah Mitehell two years later.
He is listed as a Capt. in the Roster of North

 

Carolina Rangers from 1776 to 1782. He fought
on the American side during the Revolutionary
War, while his father supplied great quantities
of wheat to Washington's Army at Valley Forge.

 

 
Houston, Christopher 4

 

Christopher helped to found Statesville, N.
C., and other towns. He added a room to his
house to be used as a school. Moses Waddell
taught there, while Christopher became the first
postmaster in Houstonville, Iredell County.

Christopher ("Kit") Carson was born on Dec.
24, 1809,in Christopher Houston's cabin on
Hunting Creek. Mrs. Enfield says that "Kit"
was named Christopher Houston Carson after his
host.

In 1814, Houston, together with his wife and
some of his slaves, settled in Tenn., there to

(as,probably,a son or grandson) of Captain James
Houston (1747-1819), an Irish immigrant of Revo-
lutionary fame. He was captain of the N.C. ran-

gers (1777-1780) and was wounded in the Battle o
Ramseur's M&l1. Captain Placebo Houston had a
large family connection of sons, daughters, niec
es, and nephews, among whom this correspondence
chiefly passed. Many of these younger members
of the family went west and settled in Alabama,

Mississippi, and Missouri. The chief value of
the collection lies in these letters describing
the new regions, climate, crops, manner of lige,
etc. There is comment on the prices of slaves
and land. Aside from this the correspondence is
chiefly family and personal,with about half of

it passing between women members of the family.
Occasional comments of social interest appear
amidst the gossip and accounts of routine life.
The family was strongly Presbyterian.

Habersham informed Gov. Houstoun of negotiations

with Indian representatives concerning land
purchases. He also discussed an incident in
which Georgia residents had mistreated two
Indians. This letter was previously part of
the John Habersham Collection (now the
Habersham Family MSS.)

On Apr. 28, 1787, Houstoun, appointed as a
member of a commission to settle a boundary
dispute with representatives from South
Carolina, wrote a dissent to the agreement
reached by the two parties.

Members of the grand jury of Liberty Co.,

judge of the Superior Court, asking that the
session of court be adjourned to allow the
jurors to devote their time to putting down an
Indian attack (July, 1793).

Merritt was a Congressman and Senator from
Michigan, the son of Otis and Polly (Milling-
ton) Howard. Graduating from Williams College
in 1830, he studied law in Mass. and was ad-
mitted to the bar in Detroit, Mich. in 1833.

In 1838, he was elected to the Michigan State
Legislature from Wayne County. In 1854, he
was elected Attorney General of Michigan and
served until 1861. From 1862 to 1871, he was

 
Howard, Jacob Merritt 2
a member of the United States Senate. He held
influential positions on the judiciary and mil-
itary affairs committees during his first term,
He helped draft the first chause of the Thir-
teenth Amendment. After the Civil War, Merritt
was an outspoken opponent of executive recon-
struction and favored extreme punishment for

 

the South. He served during the session of
1865-66 on the Joint Committee on Reconstruc-
tion and was asked to investigate conditions
in Va., N.C. and S.C.

 
Howard, Jacob 3
The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
was formulated by the Joint Committee on Re-
construction of which Senator Howard was a
member. Congress passed this amendment in
1866, and it was ratified in 1868. This
1866 manuscript (16 pp.) entitled "Recon-
struction, ‘Report of the Committee" contains
Howard's notes and opinions on the four sec-
tions of the 14th Amendment.

Governor John Eager Howard (1752-1827) had
a distinguished Revolutionary war record before
becoming the first governor of Maryland under
the Federal Constitution, 1789-1792. His
papers are official in character. Alexander
Contee Hanson accepted appointment as
Chancellor of Maryland on Oct. 3, 1789. A
letter by John Eager Howard's son, Benjamin
Chew Howard (1791-1872), concludes the papers.

1 volume, added 6-1-70: is a notebook kept
by William Howard (1793-1834), the fourth son
of Governor John Eager Howard. Young Howard
and his brothers served in the Mechanical
Volunteers of Baltimore at the Battle of North
Point, Sept. 12, 1814, Shortly thereafter, in
1818, he was a pupil of the great Austrian

founder of Phrenology, Franz Josef Gall
(1758-1828), in Paris. The notes which William
Howard kept give brief biographical glimpses

of the medical career of Gall in Vienna

Dr. William Howard, as he is designated,
chose to become a civil engineer, one of the

Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. In
his little notebook is a sketch of the ramparts
of a fort, a design similar to those used in
this period for coastal defenses in the United
States. Under it is the word Baltimore.

Howard was a soldier and Commissioner of
the Freedmen's Bureau. On May 12, 1865, Pres-
ident Johnson appointed him Commissioner of
the Freedmen's Bureau, and he continued in
his post until June 30, 1872. While he was

well intentioned in his post as Commissioner,
his ability as and executive left much to be
desired. The Bureau was much criticized,
particularly the rank and file of lower

 
Howard, Oliver Otis 2
Bureau officials some of whom were unfit and
corrupt. While from time to time charges were
made against Howard, he was completely exon-
erated.

The collection consists of two letters,
both written while Howard was Commissioner

 

of the Freedmen's Bureau. One dated April

6, 1870, addressed to U.S. Senator from Miss-
issippi, Adelbert Ames, was written by Brig-
adier-General George Williamson Balloch,

 
Howard, Oliver Otis 3
Chief Disbursing Officer of the Bureau, in-
forming Ames that he did not need any more
paid bounty agents in Mississippi, The
second letter dated June 21, 1870, is ad-
dressed by Martin Wilson Philips to Howard.
He is writing on behalf of four young men in
his employment. Philips is editor-in-chief

 

of The Southern Farmer. The men had pur-
chased land with unclear titles as a result
of that land having been sold under a spe-

 

 
Howard, Oliver Otis 4
cial war tax and bought by the federal govern-
ment. Most of Philip's letter, however, is
devoted to his views on Reconstruction.

Howe, Luther Historical Sketch
Sale of Land and Slaves May 20, 1836
New Orleans, La.

 

The account of this sale by the heirs
of Luther Howe consists of 13 pages of
bound MSS. Howe had bought several tracts
land on the outskirts of New Orleans

from Philip Auguste Delachaise and
Francois Xavier Maptin in 1823. Howe and
Martin had operated a brick manufacturing
Plant on the land previous to 1836 and
had employed at least 27 slaves in the
Plant. Thus, it seems that Howe owned the

 
Howe, Luther Historical Sketch (2)
Sale of Land and Slaves

land while both he and Martin operated the
brick plant with slaves belonging to both.
This bill of sale records that the entire
property was sold to James Hopkins who
gave 5 promissory notes totalling $35,400

 

for the land, slaves and brick plant.
The linear measures used in describing
the various tracts of land are French terms:
an arpent equivalent to 12 rods and a
toise equivalent to 6 feet.

Francois Xavier Martin (b. in Marseilles,

settled first in America at Newbern, N. C.
where he became a printer and later achieved
fame as a historian of N. C. In Louisiana

he achieved fame as a jurist and became

known as the father of jurisprudence in
that state.

This bill of sale is valuable in so
far as it throws light on the sale of pro-
perty in 1836 and for the information it
reveals on the activities of Francois
xavier Martin.

Robert Howe (1732-1786) was a planter in
Bladen, (later Brunswick) County, N.C. He
took an early interest in the Revolutionary
movement, serving as a member of the Committees
of Safety in Brunswick and Wilmington, the

Provincial Congress, and of the local Committee
of Correspondence. In 1775, he was made

colonel of the 2nd N.C. Regiment and saw action
in Virginia. He was promoted to brigadier and
later major general of the Continental Army in

conditions in Georgia and S.C., and his pro-
posals for an expedition to East Florida.

Samuel Gridley;’a physician and reformer,
was the husband of Julia Ward Howe. The
letter comprising this collection was written
on Oct. 6, 1868. Howe wrote a short note on
the reverse side of a fragment of a letter

probably written by his wife. The recipient,
a Mr. Dwight, evidently was John Sullivan

he transfered his business to Philadelphia.
His letters contain some comment on his business
and mention his family of eight children.
About 1819 ¥, Milton Howe went to Richmond
County, Virginia, where he conducted a school
of forty students. His letters give some des-
cription of the country and his impressions of

Meanwhile his brother, Silas Howe, had come

comment on the hard times following the panic

Most members of the family had an unusually
pessimistic outlook on life and were constantly

@27 pieces. Sketch. Virginia
Philip Howerton, the son of Captain
William Howerton of Essex County, Virginia,
was born December 31, 1793 and was still
living in 1873, As early as 1818, Philip

 

Howerton had moved to Halifax County,Va.
although apparently he had only recently
removed from Essex County. By 1823 he had
bought 227 acres of land next to that of
his brother James on the Dan river. In
the same year he 6 192 acres in the

same locality fro Bedford Brown of

 
 

Of Caswell County, North Carolina. 4,
his death, Howerton owned 814 acres ail
in Halifax County and apparently in one
tract. His estate known as "Oakland",
was located one and one-half miles south
of Halifax Court House.

The collection reveals a few facts
about the Howerton family. Philip Howerton's
father, William, was dead by January 10,
1831. Apparently James Howerton, brother
of Philip moved to issippi, and another
brother, Eldridge @ lived in Tennessee.

 
HOWERTON, Philip H. Sketch. (3)

They also had a sister named Charlette and
apparently another brother, William P, In
1823 Philip Howerton married Elizabeth Cc.
probably Elizabeth Cabaniss. Of this union
at least three children were born: two
daughters Judith and Elizabeth, who attended

 

St. Mary's School in Raleigh during 1844 if
not longer and William Matthew Howerton who
was educated at the University of North
Carolina,

Philip Howerton was sreeged in various
types of business @hief of which was farming.

 
 

HOWERTON, Philip H. Sketch. (4).
Howerton and Willian Cabaniss were partners
in a tobacco business in 1845 and evidently
for some time before; later Charles Cabaniss
became Howerton's partner and remained so
until 1848 when the partnership was dis-
solved presumably due to some unfair tactics

on the part of Cabaniss. On January 1, 1849
Philip Howerton's son, William Matthew
Howerton, became his partner with the firm
name of P, and W.M. Howerton. These various

firms carried on a prosperous business in
tobacco, dealing ge Ay with firms of
Petersburg, Virgini They evidently

 
HOWERTON, Philip H. Sketeh,

handled general merchandise as a side line
for they frequently bought large quantities

of such articles from igus in Petersburg,
Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland. Howerton
as early as 1839 worked with William H. Clark,
a member of the Virginia House of Delegates,

 

 

in the sale of the Chark threshing machine
in several counties of Virginia and North
Carolina,

During 1839 and 1840, and apparently

Hoyt, Tnomas C. and Isaiah F. Papers, 1844-1909
Beverly, Mass. 90 items, Sketch 1

This collection centers aroynd two brothers,
Thomas C, and Isaiah F. Hoyt, whose family
resided in Beverly, Massschusetts. The greater
part of the collection is composed of items
relating to the brothers' sepsrate business
activities. The remaining items are chiefly
letters exchanged between various members of
the Hoyt family. The collection tovers the yeas
1844-1909,

Perhaps the most valuable items in the
collection are those relating to Thomas C. Hoyt

 

 
fy

Hoyt, Thomas ©. ana Isaiah F, 2
After spending his boyhood in Beverly, Thomas
jJourrmyed to.Boston where he obtained emoloy-
ment as a crewSman abdard a merchentship.
Letters written to him by his mother and sisters
in 1847 indicate thet his initial voyages were
to Africa. Ne won rapid promotion. By 1856, he
was captain of the barque Arthur, an American

 

shio which was engaged in the pepper trade off
the coast of Sumatra.

The papers dealing with the pepper trade
are numerous and enlightening. Mdst important
among these are a series of letters received

 
Hoyt, Tuomas C. and Isaiah F. 3
by Hoyt between 1859 and 1865 from George
Gardner, the owner of the Arthur. These letters

contain instructions $8uch matters as the routes

 

to take to Sumatra, the price to pay for raw
pepper, and the disposal of pepper on the
European market. Also of importence are papers
giving information on the financing of the

pepper trede. These include letters of credit
from European financial houses and invoices
which give the content of the cargo cerried to
Sumatra for trade. Information on the conduct
of trade along the Sumatra coast is given in

 
Hoyt, Thomas C, and Isaiah F, 4
several letters received by Hoyt from captains
of dher pepper ships. These contain comment

on the pepper crop anc prospects for vurchasing
peppers in different localities. Scattered
throughout these papers is incidental infor-
mation on trade with China and the effect of
the American Civil War on international trade.

 

By the late 1860's, Hoyt had accumulated a
Sizable fortune which enabled him to retire
fromthe sea. The few papers relating to the
later years of his life indicate that he merried
in 1868. Part of his fortune was invested in the

 
Hoyt, Thomas 0, amd Isaian F. 5
New England Shoe and Leather Association, of
which his nephew, Charles Hoyt, was president.
No information is available on the date of his
death, but a letter written by his mnevphew
indicates that he was alive as lete as 1909.
The papers of Isaiah F. Hoyt are more

scattered and less informative than those of

 

his brother, Only five items represent the
period before 1888, These indicate that
Isaiah left Beyverly in 1845 to seek employment
in Boston, When the Civil War broke out, he
became an officer in the Thirty Second Mass-
achusetts oo of his

 
Hoyt, Thohes C. and Isaian F, 6
military career is incluced in the papers.
After the war he became Secretsry of the Union
Flax Mills in Chicago. His letters for this
period contain little about business affairs,
however. In 1868 he was appointed Deputy
Collector of Internal Revenue for the First
District of Illinois. Many of the papers relat-
ing to the later years of his life are con-
cerned with efforts made to obtain money owed
to him for service in the army. After his death
in 1900 his widow, Josephine Hoyt, carried on
correspondence with a real estate dealer over

 

 
Hoyt, Thomas 0. and Isaian F, 7
the disposal of some land.

Included in the collection are a few letters
written by Isaiah Hoyt's sons, Charles and
Arthur Hoyt. Both men were associated with the
New England Shoe and Leather Association. In
one letter, which was written in 1909, Charles
gives some statistics on the volume of business
Gone by the Company during the preceding year.
