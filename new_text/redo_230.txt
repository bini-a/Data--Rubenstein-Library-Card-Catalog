Wood, Thomas Fanning. Papers, 1885
Wilmington, N. C.

Thomas Fanning Wood was an eminent physician
of Wilmington. In 1877, chiefly through his
efforts, the General Assembly established the
State Board of Health. In 1879 the Board elect-
ed Dr. Wood its first secretary, and he served
in that capacity until he died in 1892. He
also edited the North Carolina Medical Journal.

A letter of May 20, 1885, from Alvan Went-
worth Chapman to Dr. Wood concerns the Reverend
Moses Ashley Curtis, botanist and minister,
whose botanical studies led him to specialize
in fungi and become a noted authority on that

 

 

 
Wood, Thomas Fanning 2
subject. Chapman was responding to an inquiry
by Wood about materials for his writing a sketch
of Curtis. Chapman says he corresponded with
Curtis for many years and comments on his per-
sonality as reflected in his letters. He says
that he has destroyed all the letters he re-
ceived from Curtis and tells why. He goes on to

 

list several of Curtis's printed works on the
botany of North Carolina and to say that Henry
William Ravenel was probably more intimate with
Curtis than any other botanist.

Letters and Papers. 1837-1905. 96 pieces

These papers include letters written to John
Woodall, the overseer of Thomas T. Treadway of
Prince Edward county, Va. and family correspond-
ence of the Woodalls. Treadway, himself, was a

member of the Va. House of Delegates in 1856.
There are a number of his letters to John Wood-
all, but the most valuable letters in the col-

 
Woodall, John Sketch

 

lection are those of William Woodall to his bro-
ther John Woodall. William lived in Prince Edw-
ard county until 1853 when he moved to Halifax
county, Va. where he svent the remainéer of his
life. William Woodall was an observant man of
some education, and throughout his correspondence

there are valuable references to social and
agricultural conditions from 1839 to 1876. Will-
tam had several children among whom were Robert,

 
Woodall, John Sketch (3)

 

Sally, Catherine, James, William and Henry. Sev-
eral of these children martied and lived in Hal-
ifax county, Va.

The letters reveal little or nothing about
Hohn Woodall other than the fact that he was an
overseer. The letters show the intimate conditi-
ons of small farming in the state of Va. from
1839 to 1870 and migration of small farmens to
the West after the war. There are also numerous

references to the cultivation of tobacco.

Woodard, George T. Papers. Wisconsin

 

The collection contains three letters from
George T. Woodard to his friend, Genie Smith.
Woodard was a union soldier in the 8th Wis-
consin Regiment of Infantry Volunteers, known
as the "Eagle" Regiment. The letters were
written on Camp Randall, Madison, Wisconsin,
stationery that carried a large eagle on the
letterhead. In Joseph O. Barrett's work The
Soldier Bird "Old Abe": The Live-War Eagle
of Wisconsin (1876) there is an explanation

 

 

 
Woodard, George T. 2
of haw a live eagle nicknamed "Old Abe" became
the standard bearer for the Regiment.

In the earliest letter, Sept. 22, 1861,
Woodard told Genie he had been promoted to
2nd Sergeant after only one week, having been
voted to this rank by his peers. He said
Gov. Randall (Governor of Wisconsin) had pro-
nounced the 8th Regiment to be the "crack"
regiment so much so that he intended to escort
them to Washington, He described his living
quarters and some of the uncomfortable as-

 

 
Woodard, George T. 3
pects of army life, but said he was trying to
remember "the cause."

One is able to gain an insight into Wood-
ard's interests and concerns. One senses
that he is homesick for both Genie and for
members of his family. He pleaded with her
to write to him at least one long letter a
week. He expressed a romantic interest in
Genie but understood that she was to marry
"Jim." He was concerned over the "course
and rough elements of society" with whom he

 

 
Woodard, George T. 4
had to deal but said he would do his best to
“keep my soul as white as possible." Several
times Woodard's sense of humor came through,
He expressed dismay over a picture that was
taken of him and said the person who took it
should be "arrested for malpractice."

Eight American Authors was originally published by
the Modern Language Association in 1956 under the
editorship of Floyd Stovall and sponsored by the Amer-
ican Literature Section of MLA. A supplement done by
J. Chesley Mathews appeared in 1962. James Woodress

American Literature Section of MLA to undertake a
revision. Dr. Woodress first invited the original
contributors who were still active to redo their
chapters. Walter Blair, Harry H. Clark, Jay B.

 
Woodress, James Leslie 6

Hubbell, Lewis Leary, and Floyd Stovall of the origi-
nal group accepted the task. Robert Gale, Nathalie

Wright, and Roger Asselineau completed the roster of
contributors. This revised edition was published by
W. W. Norton in 1971. The correspondence relative to
its publication is in the folders marked Eight Ameri-

 

can Authors in the Woodress Papers: Writings.
Dissertations in American Literature, 1891-1955,

through 1966. Completed dissertation titles, the
degree-granting institutions, the date the disserta-
tions were completed, and other titles still in prog-
ress are arranged first by subject then alphabetically

loanec, papers concerning the hiring of slaves
and other business papers of Benjamin E.

E. Woodruff was licensed to preach by the
Methodist Church. A document of April 18,
1886 between Woodruff and James Drysdale, 2nd
Lieut. and Ass't. Sup't. Freedmen's Bureau,
exnlains that the former shall take care of
two orphans--probably Negroes--during their

 

"apprenticeship." There is a $2500 policy

of the Virginia Protection Life Insurance Co.,
which operates on a novel idea; when a policy
holder dies each member is assessed so much

to pay off the deceased's policy, and thus,
the yearly dues are @ small.

The scattered letters of this collection give

a very limited amount of information about the

chief figures concerned, Isabella Ann Roberts

was born on April 6, 1837, and spoke of herself

as a Georgian, She had a brother, Samuel C.,

born perhaps about 1845, Her mother was Louisa

Roberts and her grandmother Elizabeth S. Roberts,

Isabella was married at an early age to Mr. Wood

ruff who died shortly thereafter. He was probaby

a brother of Josephus Woodruff, clerk of the

came Republican clerk of the S. C. Senate and
a member of the Republican Printing Co. (with
A. O. Jones, the mulatto clerk of the House of
Representatives, 16868-1877). A "printing ring"
as well as @ “legislative ring” existed in the
Republican government of Reconstruction South
Carolina. Woodruff, as is evident from his
diary, knew such Democrats as Thos, Young Simons
Andrew Magrath, and Generals Shannon and Kersha
He had bought a house in Me@ting Street,

frequently to Columbia
where his son, Willie, was running the printing
business. He and Jones let contracts for pub-
lic printing to themselves and to a selected
group of printers throughout S. C. Evidently
large bribes were passed to secure large print-

ing appropriations; pay certificates were given
members of the printing committee of the Legis-
lature for their approval of printing bills.
Woodruff evidently was involved in these frauds;
yet he speaks of the money Daniel Henry

ancis Louls Cardozo had re-

ceived from printing appropriations and calls
many Republican politicians blackmailers,
frauds, and rascals. He is a member of the
printing ring, but he also keeps hoping the
Democrats will carry the next election.

The diary concerns the years 187-1875 when

 

the Republican Printing Company was having a
hard time financially and when a suit against
it for fraud was launched. There is much com-
promise and agreement among the Radicals. Evi-
dently in 187h-75 they were beginning to split

up Into rival groups. Woodruff mentions the

Bolters in 1874 who opposed Daniel Henry
Chamberlain. T. C. Dunn, McIntyre, and Samuel
Lee tried to elect John T. Green,

Among the newspapers mentioned are the newly
founded Charleston Sun, which lasted but a sho
time. Woodruff disliked F. W. Dawson I and B,

R. Riordan of the Charleston Daily News. They
evidently returned this detestation and attacked
Woodruff in their paper, He called them frauds
and blackmailers. Woodruff also mentions the
Columbia Daily Union Herald, Chamberlain's paper

 

 
Woodruff, Josephus s
Evidently printing money was going to support
this paper.

The diary is a maze of names of Democratic
and Republican politicians. Chief among the
“rascals” are Governor Franklin Moses, Jr.,
and Treasurer F. L. Cardozo. Others named free
quently are Judge Richard B. Carpenter, Senator

 

John James Patterson, Edmund Wilson, McGregor

Robert Woody was q merchant of Chatham Co.,
N. 0., and was postmaster at Mudlick in that
county in the 1830's. For a number of years hd
had a business partner named Dixon. The paper
of Newton D. Woody start in 1848. He was a

 

Quaker, as Robert Woody may have been, and in
the 1850's was in the mercantile and milling
business with The. Dixon... He lived at Snow
Camp and near Shaw's Mills, Guilford Co.,N.C.

 
Woody, Robert and Newton D. 2

 

According to a printed letter written by Bryan
Tyson in Oct. 1872, Newton D. held a petty of—
fice at the beginning of the Civil War which
exempted him from military service, but later
he had to choose between serving in the Confed.
Army and fleeing North, and chose the latter,
leaving his wife and children behind. These

papers reveal, however, that he was a captain
in the 68th Regt. of N. C. Militia from at
léast some time in 1862 to the latter pa

1864. By Jan. 1865 he had gone to Indianapolis

Mills.

Joseph Emerson Worcester, ohilologist, was
born in Bedford, N.H. Aug 24, 1784 and died in
Cambridge, Mass. Oct. 27, 1865. After graduating
from Yale and teaching for several years at
Salem and Andover, he moved to Cambridge in 1819

when he devoted the remainder of his life to
quiet study and writing. He published a number
of books, including Elements of Geography,

Ancient and Modern, accompanied by an Historical

Atlas, Epitome of History, all of which were
notable for their accuracy and agreeable style.
As a lexicographer he came into conflict with
Noah Webster and while gmiffering with Worcester
Webster lated adopted many of the former's ideas
From 1831 to 1843 Worcester was editor of the

 

American Almanac and in collecting Virginia
material he sought the aid of John Minor.
John Minor (1797-1862), the fourth of that

name was the son of John and Lucy Landon (Carte

Minor. He was born at Hazel Hill, Fredericksburg
Va., and died while Fredericksburg was the cen-
ter of military operations. He completed his
education at St. Johns College, Maryland and
went to sea for one voyage on a seventy-four

gun man-of-war as secretary to the commodore.

Tired of the sea he studied law and built up a
considerable practice. He early developed a
taste for folk lore and traditional Virginia

history and was considered an authority on

such matters. He possessed one of the largest
and most valuable libraries of Virginia books
and manuscripts. He was a contributor to the
Literary Messenger.

The collection contains seven letters from
Worcester to Minor relative to the compilation
of material and publication of the American Alma
anac, Worcester was especially interested in
obtainig material on the government of Virginia,

Worth Family. Papers. Wilmington, New
Hanover County, N.C,

 

The Worth Family Collection was formed when
several smaller collections were combined.
These papers had formerly been cataloged under
the names of Jonathan Worth, David Gaston Worth,
William E. Worth and Company, and the Universal

Oil and Fertilizer Company. -When the addition-
al papers described later in this sketch were
acquired, it was considered advisable to place
the personal and professional papers of the
various members of the Worth family in one col-
lection. The papers S conSist lereely of

 
Worth Family 2
correspondence exchanged within the family, and
any division of these papers would have separa-
ted the family unit into fragmented and less
comprehensive small collections.

The principal figures in this collection
are Jonathan Worth, his son David Gaston Worth,
and his nephew William Elliott Worth. Jonathan

 

Worth (1802-1869) was born in Guilford County,
North Carolina, and settled in Asheboro. He
served several terms in the state legislatiire.
He was first identified with the Whig party
and though he opposed secession, he remained
loyal to his state and served as its treasurer

 
Worth Family 3
during the closing years of the Civil War. He
was elected governor after the war and held
that position until he was replaced in 1868
after Congress took control of Reconstruction
in the South. Among the papers identified with
him are commissions signed by him as governor
and correspondence concerning his law practice
and business matters. Also included are a

copy of a newspaper article concerning a speech
he delivered at the Negro Educational Conventio
(October 13, 1866) and a certification of elec-
tion returns in Beaufort County (October 20,

1866).

Worth Family 4

David Gaston Worth (1831-1897) was Jonathan
Worth's only son. After graduating from the
University of North Carolina, he assisted his
father in managing the family property. He
served as superintendent of the salt works at
Wilmington during the Civil War and remained
in that city where he became a prosperous com-
mission merchant and wholesale grocer. His
papers were found among the business archives
of Alexander Sprunt and Son, Inc., when these
records were acquired by Duke University. Lis-
ted as number 7337 of the Sprunt office files,
the file contained or legal

 

 
Worth Family 5
papers, and financial records related to David
Gaston Worth and his estate. A memorandum of
March 24, 1950, states that Dick Cronly, a law-
yer involved in the settlement of Worth's es-
tate, had given the papers to the unidentified
writer of this memorandum some years earlier
and that they had been placed in the Sprunt

 

firm's vault. Dick Cronly is Robert Dickson

Cronly, Jr., whose family's papers are also
housed in the Manuscript Department. The

Cronly Family Collection, however, contains no
information relevant to the Worth estate.

 
Worth Family 6

The items are miscellaneous in nature and
concern Bingham School in Mebaneville, to which
Worth sent his sons; the Fifth Street Methodist
Church in Wilmington; and the various business
firms in which the Worths had an interest.

Five volumes are from the Wilmington firm
of Worth & Worth and its successor, The Worth

 

Company, that was operated variously by Bar-
zillai Gardner Worth, David Gaston Worth, and
Charles William Worth, They were grocers and

commission merchants and handled cotton and
naval stores. The volumes are: Worth and

Worth’s Ledger H, 1089-1091; Journal J, 1695-

1924 (from addition of 9-27-72).

[Continued on next card]

 
Worth Family 7
Three volumes relate to the business affairs
of William Elliott Worth, son of Jonathan
Worth's brother Barzillai Gardner Worth. A
ledger for the years 1906 to 1911 contains ac-
counts for William E. Worth and Company, a firm
listed in the Wilmington city directories as
dealing at various times in ice, groceries,
coal, and wood. The other two volumes are
records of the Universal Oil and Fertilizer
Company. W.E., Worth served as general manager
of the company and with other members of his
family owned a controlling interest in the

 

 
Worth Family 8
firm. A ledger has accounts spanning the years
from 1903 to 1914. A letterpress book contains
correspondence written from September, 1906 to
February, 1907. W.E, Worth's letters predomi-—
nate in this volume and include frequent refer*
ences to the manufacture and marketing of var-
ious fertilizers, cottonseed oil, and other
related products.

612 items added, 4-2-71: Correspondence
and miscellaneous papers of several generations
of the Worth Family. Although many members of
the family are represented as writers, addres-

 

 
Worth Family 9
sees, or both, the papers in this addition are
principally those of Jonathan, David Gaston,
and Charles William Worth.

Letters from Jonathan Worth and his wife
Martitia (Daniel) to their son while he was a
student at the University of North Carolina
concern family matters during the early 1850's
and the building of a plank road near Asheboro.
There are also a number of essays, many of
them undated, written by David Gaston Worth

while he was in college. One of them evaluates
Millard Fillmore's term as President, while

 

 
Worth Family 10
another comments on the right of states to
secede. Civil War correspondence relates to
financial conditions in the Confedearcy and to
the Confederate salt works at Wilmington.
Jonathan Worth wrote frequently to his son
during these years to urge him to retain his
status as exempt from conscription first as an

 

overseer on the family plantations and later as
superintendent of the salt works. Random com-
ments on Zebulon Baird Vance and William Woods
Holden also eee in these letters.

Charles William Worth attended Bingham

 
Worth Family 11
School and the University of North Carolina,

and there are numerous letters written by him

to his parents and by them to him while he was
at Mebaneville and Chapel Hill. These letters
refer to both schools, life at home in Wilming-
ton, and to many members of the family. Later
letters, particularly those written by his great

 

uncle, Barzillai Gardner Worth, concern business
matters,

In 1912, he tried to secure an appointment
as American consul at Shanghai. Letters from
and to Furnifold McLendel Simmons, Lee Slater
Overman, James Hinton ry Josephus Daniels,

 
 

Worth Famil 12
and Hannibat Lafayette Godwin concern these

efforts. Edwin Anderson Alderman had been a
close friend at college, and he too was ap-
proached to help Worth obtain the position.
James Sprunt of Wilmington also wrote a lengthy
letter to Woodrow Wilson in his friend's be-
half. The letters on this subject during 1912

and 1913 illustrate the machinations of the
patronage system and of Wilson's administration.
Later letters reveal similar facts about North

Carolina when Worth solicited appointments to
several state positions.

 
Worth Family fia 13
David Gaston Worth and his wife Julia Anna
(Stickney) were devoted to their Worth kin,
few of whom had attained the professional and
financial security that their Wilmington
relatives had. They assisted their family on
numerous occations and in many different ways.
Letters to them from their relations attest to

 

their generosity.

George Clarkson Worth, a son of D.G. Worth,
was a medical missionary in China. Letters
concerning him can be found in the papers of
James Sprunt in the Alexander Sprunt and Son
Collection in this “eo

This collection contains three MSS. of Francis
Wrangham (1769-1842), classical scholar and mis-
cellaneous writer, One MS. (July 9, 1806) con-
tains the poem “Lines on Leaving Hornby Castle",
which Wrangham addressed to Charlotte (Townshend)
Osborne, Duchess of Leeds, A letter (Nov. 19,

 

1808) to George William Frederick Osborne, Sixth
Duke of Leeds, contains a copy of a satirical
poem, “Col, Thornton's Departure from York to
Spy Park in Wiltshire," which was attributed to
Martin Hawke (probably Martin Bladen Edward

 
Wrangham, Francis, 2

 

Hawke). Wrangham, however, believed Major Top-
ham was the auth@r, Wrangham included an une
titled poem of sixteen lines in which he eulo-
logized the late Charles James Fox. A letter of
Nov. 8, 1836, was apparently also addressed to
the Sixth Duke of Leeds. It contains an amusing
incident which occurred at Farnley, the home of
Walter Ramsden Hawksworth Fawkes, Wrangham also
mentioned the marriage of his daughter Lucy to

Robert Franklin Wrenn was for many years a
partner in the mercantile firm of Wrenn Brotherg
Company of Siler City. He married Emma Woody,
daughter of Newton Dixon and Susan Elizabeth

(Corsbie) Woody. (See also the Robert and New-
ton Dixon Woody Papers in this department.) The
Wrenn children were Flora May, Lizzie Taylor,
and Cara Frances. May and Lizzie both grad-
uated from Trinity College, as did John Allen
Morgan, whom May married. This collection

 
Wrenn-Morgan Family 2
consists of papers of members of more than one
generation of the Wrenn and Morgan families.
The notes that Cara (Mrs. H.L. Jordan) attached
to many of the manuscripts identify many of the
people mentioned in them.

The correspondence is all of a personal na-

 

ture. The first letters are from young ladies
and are filled with chitchat about their in-

terests that include schools, romances, mutual
acquaintances, and social and domestic activi-
ties. An uncle of Mrs. Robert Wrenn, Frank H.

 
Wrenn-Morgan Family 3
Woody, Postmaster of Missoula, Montana, wrote
to her on Jan. 16, 1870, about a gold-mining
venture in Missoula County, the joy of sleigh
riding, and urged her and her brothers to be
diligent students. He said he was largely self
educated, but he wrote a fine hand. He men-

 

tioned that almost every day uneducated people
came to him to write for them.

J.W. Browed wrote to Robert Wrenn from Yad-
kin College, Davidson County, commenting on the
student body, the coming election in 1880, and

 
Wrenn-Morgan Family 4
the political strife that sometimes led to mur-
ders. Letters from R.F.D. Fouche of Alamo,
Tennessee, an uncle of Robert Wrenn, appear

in the early 1880s and in 1903. Other corre-
spondence shows that some members of the Fouche
family changed the name to Foushee. A letter

 

of June 12, 1884, from Newton D. Woody to his
daughter Emma reveals his interest in education
and temperance, reporting that a Miss Newby
gave a temperance lecture to a full house in
the vicinity of Woody's Mills.

Correspondence and grade reports contain
information about the following schools and
colleges in North Carolina: Fairfield Academy,
Hughes Academy, Friends' School, Pleasant Lodge
Academy, Siler City Institute, Southern Conser-
vatory of Music, Sylvan Academy, Thompson Schoo

 

Davenport College, Trinity College, and Yadkin
College.

The correspondence between May Wrenn and
John A. Morgah appears from June, 1907, until i
December, 1910, when they married. After grad-
uating from Trinity, e taught English at

 
Wrenn-Morgan Family 6
Davenport College in Lenoir, 1908-1910. Her
friend Mary Melissa Tapp of Kinston, who grad-
uated from Trinity College in 1910, succeeded
her there, and a lengthy letter from Mary writ-
ten between Sept. 29 and Oct. 9, 1910, relates
her experiences and observations as a beginning

 

teacher at Davenport.

May's younger sister Lizzie taught school
after graduating from Trinity, but she died on
Sept. 6, 1918. In 1921 the Methodist Church of
Siler City gave $500 to Trinity College for the

 
Wrenn-Morgan Family a
establishment of the Lizzie Taylor Wrenn Fund
to support the purchase of books for its li-
brary. Robert F. Wrenn, a loyal Methodist,
died in 1913 and several letters of condolence
testify to his fine character.

After graduating from Trinity John A. Morgan

 

taught there before going to Middlebury College
to teach economics. Later he joined the
Guaranty Trust Company of New York. Excerpts
from a letter by Mrs. Morgan to her mother de-
tail their trip by automobile in August, 1915,

 
Wrenn-Morgan Family 8
from Siler City to Middlebury, Vermont. In
New York Mrs. Morgan was active in Alpha Delta
Pi, in Christ Church as an assistant to the
Reverend Ralph W. Sockman, and as a member and
chairman of the New York Women's Council of the
Save the Children Federation. The Morgans died

 

near the same time in 1949,

There is genealogy of the Wrenn, Woody, and
Stewart families. The oldest items in the
collection are four untitled religious poems
written between 1828 and 1835 by Evelina Brower
John Wesley York, and Elizabeth B. Wren. The

 
Wrenn-Morgan Family 9
clippings and pictures are largely about and

of the Wrenn and Morgan families. A photograph
of Mary Melissa Tapp shows her very fashionably
dressed, and in one letter her fashionable
manner of dressing is mentioned. There are alsa
photographs of the Newton D. Woody homeplace
and several members of the Woody family.

Ambrose Ransom Wright (1826-1872) was a lawye
and politician in Georgia. In 1859 he settled
ia Augusta where he established a law practice.
When he entered the Vonfederate Army in 1861,
he was elected colonel of the 3rd Georgia

Regiment and in 1862 was promoted to brigadier
general. In 1863, he was elected to the state
senate and to the presidency of that body. He
retained his command while he served in the

legislature, and a document dated Oct. 25, 1864

 
wright, Ambrose Ransom, Papers 2
indicates that he was granted a leave of absense
from the Army to attend to his political career.
He had also received a disability furlough on
July 16 of the same year. After the war he re-
turned to Augusta and edited The Chronicle and
Sentinel. He was elected to Congress in 18/2,
but he died before he could take his seat. See

 

 

Men of Mark in Georgia (III, 312-321)for fur-
ther biog Zraphical information on Wright.
The papers constituting this collection are

a miscellaneous lot comprised of letters and
documents. The letters written during 1861

 

 
Wright, Ambrose Ransom. 3
concern Wright's activities on the coast of
North Carolina. There had apparently been a
misunderstanding regarding wright's orders and
the relationship between the militia and the
regular army.

Letters of March and April, 1863, discuss the
request by the officers of the 3rd Georgia

 

Regiment for a transfer from Wright's brigade
to George T. Anderson's command. Three of the
letters were written by W. Uazlenurst who was
perhaps related to Wright's second wife Carrie
(Hazlehurst) Wright. His letter of April 4,

 
Wright, Ambrose Ransom. 4
1863, includes a copy of the officers’ petition.
The remainder of the collection consists of

personal letters and requests for assistance.
Letters of introduciton for Wright are dated
Aug. 8 and 10, 1866. They were written to W.C.
Patterson and C.L. Vallandingham who were asked
to assist Wright during his visit to
Philadelphia for the Democratic party conven-
tion.

Franklin S. Wright was an infantryman in
Company E, 33rd Regiment, of the Masschusetts
Volunteers. There are thirty-eight letters in
the collection dating from March 4, 1862, to
January 1, 1864. Thirty-five of the letters

were written by Franklin, one was written by his
brother Evander, who was in the same regiment,
one was written jointly by Franklin and Evander,
and one was written by Lieutenant Colonel H. J.

 
Wright, Franklin S. 2

 

Parker to their father. Evander is referred to

in several letters.as E. In Evander's letters

Franklin is sometimes referred to as F.

Several letters written by Franklin are un-

signed. Some of the letters written in pencil

are so faded as to be almost indecipherable.
The letters from Franklin and Evander are

addressed to various members of their family.
Topics covered in most of the letters deal with
everyday aspects of camp life, including
establishing camps as they moved from one area

 
Wright, Franklin S. 3
to another. Clothing and food were matters of
particular concern. Several times Franklin de-
scribed food packages that he had received from
home and gave a detailed description of those
items that had made the journey successfully and
those items that had not. Franklin mentioned
several times how much he would like to get a
furlough and come home. He celebrated his
twenty-second birthday in Sept., 1863. Money
matters, health, weather and inquiries about
mutual acquaintances were prevalent topics.

 

 
Wright, Franklin S.

 

Franklin made an effort to keep up with what
was going on back home particularly the dis-
position of his possessions.

Most of letters were from locations in
Virginia. From March, 1862, until Feb. 1863,
they were addressed at various times from the
following camps or places: Stafford Courthouse
in Stafford Co., Va., referred to in several
letters as Camp Orlando Smith; Camp Slough near
Alexandria, Va.; Bristoe Station, Va.; German-
town, Va.; Falmouth, Va. and Fredericksburg,

Va.

 
Wright, Franklin S. 5
From March until June, 1863, the letters were
addressed from the camp near Stafford Court-
house in Stafford County, Va. From July, 1863,
until the collection ends in Jan., 1864, letters
were addressed from: Catlett's Station, Va.;
the William County Courtyard in Brentsville, Va.;
Bridgeport, Ala.; and Lookout Valley, Tenn.

 

Following is a listing of various topics from
different letters in the collection. One of the
most humorous items appearing in the letters
was Franklin's description of southern mos-
quitos (Aug. 18, 1862) for the folks back home

 
Wright, Franklin S.

 

in Massachusetts. Franklin spoke of his
company crossing a brook, that had risen, ina
pontoon boat (Mar. 4, 1862). He does not de-
scribe having been in any battles. Ina letter
dated Aug. 31, 1862, he spoke of "Stonewall"
Jackson's having been beaten [this was at the
time of the Second Battle of Manassas.] Ina

later letter, May 14, 1863, he spoke of Jack-
son's death at Chancellorsville. He said the
Union troops "won't have him to fear anymore."
Franklin wrote often of being ill. Ina letter

 
Wright, Franklin S. 7
dated Sept. 23, 1862, he said he had begun
taking medicine he brought from home rather than
the quinine and calomel that had been given to
him in camp. He spoke disapprovingly of
cowardice in general and cowardice shown by
people in Townsend, Mass., in particular. He
said some of the men were more interested in

 

making money than "fighting in a war." He spoke
approvingly of the blacks who had the courage

to defend themselves (Sept. 6, 1863). Franklin

identified what the red ink used on some of his

 
Wright, Franklin S. 8

 

letters was made from. He said it was made from
"garget" berries, another name for pokeberries
(Oct. 24, 1862). Franklin mentioned some of the
bad habits soldiers had fallen into, including
gambling, swearing, card playing and drinking
whiskey (Mar. 13, 1863). Writing from Falmouth,
Va., Franklin described a log home he and his

company were helping build (Jan. 11, 1863). In
one letter, Franklin requested that a revolver

be sent to him, but later.changed his mind. He
said there had been so many accidents with them

 
Wright, Franklin S.

 

in camp, the Colonel was going to take them
away (Oct. 16, 1862). Franklin said (Mar. 13,
1863), he was glad his brother Oscar was doing
well in school. He said no one could take an
education away from him.

One can get a few glimpses of the enlisted
men's superior officers. Ina letter dated

Oct. 3, 1862, he mentioned that his company's
Colonel and General Slough had had "another pull
about guarding the city." [The city referred
to is Alexandria, Va.] he said that Slough had

 
Wright, Franklin Ss. 10

 

carried the day--that the troops would remain
near Alexandria. In another letter (Apr. 9,
1863), Franklin said he had given up his
corporal's commission because his Captain felt
he should no longer associate with privates.
Franklin expressed that he did not feel com-
fortable with that.

The importance of protecting the railroad
depot from attack was mentioned. Writing from
Bristoe Station, Va., Franklin said "it wouldn't
do to leave it [the railroad depot] a minute,"

(Sept. 21, 1863).

 
Wright, Franklin S. 11
Franklin gave a lengthy description of his
company's move by train from the camp at

Bristoe Station, Va., to a camp at Bridgeport,
Ala. (Oct. 2, 1863).

Sir James Wright (ca. 1714-1785) was born
in Charleston, S.C. After serving as British
agent, chief justice, and lieutenant governor
of S.C. he was appointed royal governor of
Georgia in 1760 and retained his position

until 1776. He returned in 1779 and held his

office until the end of the Revolutionary War.
The items contained in this collection are

entirely official in nature, relating mainly

 
Wright, Sir James 2

to the settlement of estates. An especially
notable item is.an address to Wright by loyal-
ists in Georgia, May 4, 1781. Citing the
alarming activities of the American patriots,
the loyalists suggested several measures
designed to protect the province from estab-
lishing its independence.

Joseph G. Wright (d. 1911) was the compiler
of the Wright Collection of Methodist Class and
Band Tickets from Great Britain, the largest
such collection in America and one of the two
or three best in the world. After Wright died,

his collection was continued and completed to
1932 by the Rev. Francis F. Bretherton of
Sunderland, England, who also compiled the John
Wesley Class Ticket Album, 1933-1954,

 
Wright, Joseph G.

 

Beginning early in British Methodism the
local societies or churches were divided into
groups called classes for purposes of prayer,
Bible Study, religious conversation, etc.

What happened in class meetings probably varied
from place to place, time to time, and leader
to leader. Leaders were normally laymen, not
ordained clergymen. The class was not suffic-
iently intimate for all of John Wesley's
purposes. Requirements for membership was
simply "the desire to flee from the wrath

 
Wright, Joseph G. 3
to come." Consequently, those who had experi-
enced the New Birth and-were advancing towards
Christian Perfection were gathered into "bands,"
smaller groups, also led by laymen, in which
the higher reaches of the Christian life could
be explored. What was said in bands was held
to be completely secret and unrepeatable.
Information about classes and bands is available
in Rupert E. Davies' Methodism.

In order to control admittance to the classes
and bands, tickets were issued. The two albums

 

 
Wright, Joseph G.

 

compiled by Wright and Bretherton contain
examples of these tickets. There are 977 orig-
inal tickets and 331 photographs or copies, a
total of 1308. The album entitled "Collection
of Wesleyan Methodist Class and Band Tickets,
by J. G. Wright, Wolverhampton, Completed to
1932 by F. F. Bretherton" contains 1234 tickets

dating 1742, 1749, 1758, 1760, 1762, 1765-1932.
In addition to regular class tickets there are
also some Junior Society Tickets, admission on
trial tickets, and non-Wesleyan tickets

 
Wright, Joseph G.

(Primitive Methodist Church, Wesleyan Reformers,
the Methodist New Connexion, the Wesleyan
Methodist Association, the Bible Christians,

and overseas cards including those from Madras
in India, Singhalese from Ceylon, Australia,

and Ireland). The name of the person to whom
the ticket was issued was handwritten upon it,

 

and sometimes the tickets were signed or
initialed by the minister who issued them. Dates
were not always printed on the early tickets,

so dates were also sometimes handwritten.

 
Wright, Joseph G. 6

 

Bretherton compiled "The John Wesley Class
Ticket Album," 1932-1954, containing 74 tickets.
They were issued from the beginning of the new
Methodist Church and date from Dec., 1932, to
June, 1954. Tickets of 1932-1949 are for
junior membership, and six of 1949-1954 are for
regular membership.

The fullest guide and catalog for class and
band tickets during Wesley's lifetime is in
articles by John H. Verney in the Proceedings
of the Wesley Historical Society, Vol. XXXI,

Folder of the collection. Wright wrote an
article on class and band tickets that was
published in the Proceedings, V, No. 2 (1905),
pp. 33-44. Near the end of Wright's album

 

 

there is a clipping of D. B. Bradshaw's article,

Mareus Joseph Wright was a Brigadier-

1878 he was appointed by the United States
Government to collect records of the Civil
War. These letters, practically all of which

This cash receipts journal was part of the
business records of the firm of Wright and Clay
at Roxboro, North Carolina. Wright and Clay
began operations early in the Civil War and
closed before the conflict ended. This informa-
tion comes from Alexander R. Foushee, Reminis-
cences (Roxboro, North Carolina, 1921), pp. 66-
67. This firm handled general merchandise, and
the prices of many commodities are recorded.

Benjamin and Elizabeth Wright had several
children, among them being Lamuel S., Benoni C.,
Noah J., and Nancy. William Self (possibly
Mrs. Wright's brother), Mary Wright (Benjamin
Wright's neice and daughter of George Wright),

and a second Lemuel S. Wright (probably
Benjamin Wright's brother) also figure in this
collection, All of the Wrights appear to have
resided in Cleveland Co., N. C., except Margaret
(Wright) Jones, another daughter of George

Wright. &

 
Wright Family 2

The papers comprising this collection consis
of letters exchanged among the family. The
majority of them were written during the Civil
War. Noah J., Lemuel S., and Benoni C. Wright
served in North Carolina regiments. Benoni C,.
Wright was in the 48th Regiment, while Lemuel S$
Wright enlisted in Co. F. of the 56th Regiment.

The Civil War letters are the only signifi-+-
cant correspondence in the collection. They
refer principally to the war in North Carolina
and Virginia. Desertion among the Confederate
troops, the siege of Petersburg in 1864, and the

 

 
Wright Family 3
war weariness of many soldiers and civilians
are discussed in these letters,

Two articles of agreement concern schools
ees County (Jan. 23, 1860 and Jan. 12,
1861).

Queen Annes Cows Mad., and Quincy, Gadsden Co.,
Fla.

 

The first part of this collection consists
of the papers of Lydia Ann (Tilton) Wright, who
appears to have been an aunt-in-law of Isaac R.
Harris, the other person who figures prominently

in the collection. Among the correspondents
are Tiltons, Wm. G. and Anna Tilghman, Samuel wW.
Polk, the Gibsons, Pere Wilmer, Martin W. Bates,
James Gadsden, Joseph L. Smallwood, Charles M.
Harris and other members of the Harris family,

 
Wright-Harris

 

E. B. Ballow, Wm. M. Tunno, Silas H. Wentz,
and Isaac Jarrett of Huntsville, N. Cc.

Mrs. Wright was in and out of Centreville,
Md., over a period of many years. Isaac R.
Harris was from Quincy,Fla.

The letters are concerned in large part
with family and other personal matters.

They do contain, however, comments on such
topics as the Mississippi Territory, the
Mexican War, the Compromise of 1850,
politics, business, and railroad building
(the Pensacola and Georgia line) in Florida,

 
Wright-Harris “
travel in the U. S. in the 1550's, the secession
crisis, and the attitude of some Southerners

in the postwar period.

In a letter of April 21, 1833, from Jennette
Gibson to her sister, Lydia Ann (Tilton) Wright,
there are comments on Florida politics of the
day, including specific references to General

 

Richard K. Call, a Florida Congressman, and
Colonel Joseph M. White, who defeated Call in
his bid for re-election. National political
figures are mentioned in a letter of May 26,
1834, to Lydia Ann (Tilton) Wright. Mrs.

 
Wright-Harris 4

 

Wright's two nieces informed her that they had
recently visited the Senate and heard Clay,
Tyler, .Wright, and Benton speak. In a letter
of October, 1836, Rebecea Gibson wrote from St.
Joseph's Florida, that approximately 150
Tennessee volunteers who had been fighting the
Indians were present in the little town.

Florida politics again are discussed in a
letter of Aug. 4, 1845, from Samuel James
Douglas to Isaac R. Harris. The attitudes of
some of those “thirsting" for war with Mexico
are revealed in a letter written from Mobile on

 
Wright-Harris

 

5

May 16, 1546, to Rebecca (Gibson) Smallwood.
A further description of the "war fever"
appears in a letter of April 8, 1847, from
James Tilton to Rebecca Smallwood. Tilton had
been appointed a lst lieut. in the lst U. S.
Voltigeurs, a unit comprised of both infantry
and cavalry (See Justin H. Smith, The War with
Mexico, II, 363). Tilton was on board the
steamer Germantown en route down the Mississippi
toward Point Isabel, Texas.

Many of the letters written in the period
1847-1860 contain information about business

 

 
Wrignt-Harris 6

 

affairs in New Orleans, Apalachicola, Fla., and
Quincy, Fla.

A letter of September 19, 1849, is one of
several from E. B. Ballow, who traveled north
from Fla. each summer to escape the heat.
According to Anderson M. Harris’ letter to
Charles M. Harris of October 26, 1849, Isaac R.
Harris had taken the fortunate step of shipping

his tobacco to New York and subsequently had
received 65 cents a pound for it.
The deliberate burning of the court house in

Quincy, Fla., is reported in a letter of Nov.

 
Wrighnt-Harris 7

12, 1549, from 5. H. Harris to C. M. Harris. The
determination of the Southerners to stand their
ground on the slavery question is outlined in

a letter of December 15, 1850, from George W.
Harris to Isaac R. Harris. The politics of the
election of 1852 receive mention both in E. B.
Ballow's letter to Isaac R. Harris of July 3l,
1852, and in a letter from "Tom" to "Hank" of

 

Dec. 3, 1852.
Several tickets for the Cuban national lot-

tery are contained in a letter of July 10, 1854,

to Isaac R. Harris from C. Mel, who, although

 
Wrignt-Harris
he has no love for Spain or things Spanish, 2
thinks the lottery a legitimate business. Also,
Mel reports that in the preceding week there
had been such extreme heat in New Orleans that
83 persons had died of sunstroke. In a letter
written by Mel on Aug. 11, 1854, he observed
that the South injured itself by annually sending
off its people and wealth to the North; until
the South learned to depend on itself it would
be dependent.

Several matters regarding the Pensacola and
Georgia Railroad are included in a letter to

 

 
wright-Harris 9

 

Isaac R. Harris of June 9, 1356, and letters fro
Harris of Nov. 30, 1858, and March 12, 1859.
A copy of a will of Lydia Ann Wright dated Aug.
19, 1836 is attached to a letter of Oct. 6, 1856
by Joseph L. Smallwood, whom she had named
trustee of her estate.

lhe typical Sovthern attitude toward seces
sion is succinctly stated in a letter of Feb.

15, 1861. Methods by which communications
passed between families separated by the con-
flict are revealed in a letter of Jan. 5, 1862,

from N. Green to Mrs. Jennette Gibson. (This

 
Wright-Harris 10

 

collection contains no letters describing
battles or other significant happenings of the
Civil War.)

Life in the postwar South receives attention
in a letter of May, 1866, from E. N. Gibson.
According to Gibson there is great unrest in
the South; no one could be safe in the midst
of a Negro population. Indeed, some people
had gone to procure information about Mexico.
Moreover, predicted Gibson, there would be an
insurrection before the next presidential
election. The letter is from Camden, Arkansas.

The remainder of the letters are concerned
in the main with family matters.

Business correspondence and other papers
of Charles Cecil Wyche (1885-19—), attorney
and U. &. district judge of the Western District
of 8. C. since 1937, Wyche also served in the
S. C. House of Representatives in 1913-14. The

political letters of Wyche begin in 1908 with
his attempt to persudde fellow graduates of the
Citadel to support John Gary Evans for the U. 8S.
Senate, Letters from family and friends mirror
Wyche's early years away from home and his work
in the law office of é}$. In July of 1909

 
Wyche , Charles Cecil : __ 2
the Dictaphone Co, was trying to sell Evans one
of their machines. Wyche's sister, Isoline,
was abroad in 1909-1910 and wrote a number of
descriptive letters about Paris and the French,
a stopover in Brussels, and her experiences in
Berlin, At the same time, his friend David H.

 

Hill wrote glowing letters about the opportu-
nities for a young man who would go west to
Oklahoma. In 1909, Wyche was admitted to the
bar and began to practice law in Spartanburg.
His correspondence shows that much of his busi-
ness as a young maw ¥ the collection of

 
Wyche, Charles Cecil 5
overdue debts; he was also the local agent for
a bonding company. Among the family letters
that continue to form a small part of the col-
lection, one from his mother dated Feb. 6, 1910,
is interesting for her comments on Ben Tillman's
taking some children to rear. On Sept. 16

 

Frank B. Gary wrote to Wyche's father, Dr. C. T.
Wyche, congratulating him on his election to
the state legislature and discussing the speaker
ship. In Apr. and May of 1911 the letters are
concerned with attempts of numerous lawyers to
put political a | Governor Cole L.

from Blease and reply round out the picture and

On July 7 an older lawyer, J. M. Nickles, wrote
to Wyche on the value of connections with com-
mercial agencies to provide a regular income

 

for a young lawyer. A letter from the state
insurance commissioner dated Oct. 21, 1912,
presses for his project of requiring life in-
surance companies to invest within the state.

a man barnstorming “eo. country in his air

plane are set forth in a group of Letters in

term in the state legislature: his idea of
abolishing convict labor in a hosiery mill, a
letter from a woman's club on a bill for medi-
cal inspection of schools, support for 8. C.

 

entering an exhibit at the Pacific Internationa
Exposition to be held in San Francisco, letters
urging defeat of a child labor law, letters
urging that a special license for medical ex-
aminers be done away with, an election on the
dispensary question, eo Opposing com-

 
Wyche , Charles Cecil 6
pulsory insurance for all working men, a bill
limiting machines to a run of no more than 60
hours a week, and a letter from the acting
president of the University of 8. C. concerning
property of Winthrop College. On Sept. 18
Wyche was informed that one of the conditions

 

for a recommendation for Wyche as assistant
district attorney was support of Ellison D.
Smith in the senatorial campaign. Legislative
business referred to in 1914 was: the announced
program of a private Child Labor Committee
formed for lobbying in_the state legislature,

 
Wyche , Charles Cecil 7
a bill on prostitution, bills against land
ownership by aliens, and an anti-pellagra bill.
Beginning this early in his legal career and
continuing throughout the collection are letters
relative to damage suits arising from accidents
in the mills, by railroads, and by automobiles,

 

In 1915, Wyche went into partnership with Miller
C. Foster, and firm letters signed by both
partners are found in the collection until 1917.
Several letters from Cole Blease in 1915 refer
to legal business. In 1916, Wyche was a strong
supporter of Blease for governor and even

 
Wyche , Charles Cecil 8
thought of running for 1t.-governor himself; the
letters contain many references to the efforts
of Blease and his supporters in this campaign.
Several letters in Aug. deal with the diffi-
culties Wyche experienced in getting repairs fo
his "Oakland" automobile. Wyche was anxious

 

to form a regiment of volunteers in case of war
with Mexico and, later, with Germany, and
throughout the year he wrote letters on the
subject, especially to his friend Sam J.
Nichols, a U. 8. congressman. On Feb. 6, 1917,
he even addressed Theodore Roosevelt on Roose-

 
Wyche , Charles Cecil 9

velt's plans in this connection. In Feb. ana
again in May letters were written in his behalf
by Senator B. R. Tillman, and the second has
interesting comments on the impropriety of
political influence for army appointments. In
March the followers of Blease established a

 

Reform Democratic Party. There are no letters
during the war period while Wyche was in the
army. In Jan., 1920, Wyche ha@ the first of
several cases scattered throughout his career
in regard to prohibition. His younger sister
wrote Jan. 29 relative to her plans for a

 
Wyche , “Charles Cecil 10
theatrical career and work in motion pictures i
New York for experience. During Jan. and Feb.
there are many references to an influenza
epidemic, Several letters in Mar. and Apr.
concern the appointment and delayed confirmatio
of J, William Thurmond as U. 8S. District Attor-

 

ney for the Western District of 8S. C. Wyche,
as shown by letters in July and Aug., supported
George Warren in an unsuccessful campaign
against Ellison D. Smith for the U. S. Senate.
Early in 1921 Wyche entered into partnership
with George W. Nicholls and Sam J. Nicholls. A

 
Wyche , Charles Cecil TT

 

number of firm letters dictated by Sam Nicholls
are in this collection and a few signed by his
father, A letter dated Apr. 2, 1921, gives in-
formation about a man who was blacklisted by
the cotton mills after he had tried to organize
a@ union in one mill. Wyche in 1921 depended on

Congressman John J. McSwain to help in cases
involving claims against the federal government
A letter dated Nov. 27 from John Gary Evans con
tains an interesting description of Italy and
the Italians and of the ruins at Pompeii. On
Feb, 11, 1922, Wyche invited his mother and

 
Wyche , Charles Cecil 12
father to come to Spartanburg to hear Billy
Sunday. Governor Wilson G. Harvey wrote a
letter commenting on public sentiment against
granting pardons, John B, Johnson joined the
firm in June as a clerk, and a few of his let-
ters are in this collection. Wyche planned to

 

purchase a phonograph in 1923 and had to wait
for the new model with an electric motor.
Several letters in Aug. concern this transactio
and the advice not to buy any records until
Sept. when Victor was coming out with a two-
faced record, In Dec, Wyche enlisted the aid

 
ayehe Charles Cecil 13
of his friend Congressman James ©. Byrnes in
getting a commission in the army reserves. On
the 10th he wrote Byrnes that Blease's announced
candidacy for the Senate had caused little
reaction, A deed of Feb. 8, 1923, and a letter
of Feb. 2, 1924, refer to the sale of Chimney

 

Rock Mountain, Inc., in N. C. The letters for
1924 are extremely valuable for the political
campaign for the Senate. Apr. 10 Blease wrote
asking Wyche to correct his statements that
Blease was not a Gandidate. For the president-
ial nomination, Wyche was asked to support

 
Wyche, Charles Cecil ee
William G. McAdoo. Wyche and Sam Nichol lséup-
ported Byrnes in his bid against Senator
Nathaniel B. Dial for re-election and Cole
Blease, Their letters and the copies of mater-
ial useful to Byrnes reveal the details of

the campaign from the Byrnes' side. Legal
papers of various kinds are scattered through-
out the collection, The miscellaneous material
contains invitations and a large nuniber of
picture post cards,

15 personal letters of which the first 6
(1845-1849) deal mainly with the Wylie family,
politics, Negroes, and the Mexican War; and of
which the last 9 (1861-1963) deal mainly with
secession, Civil War, and the Confederate Army.
(See David Duncan Wallace, The History of South

Richard E. Peter, and Mrs. Amanda S. Wylie;
Matt Johnson; R.S.M. Dow; John C. Johnson;

Wylie, William 2

 

Confederate Soldier W.W. Mobley of Martin's
Regiment writes on Sept. 8 and 27, 1861 to Han-
nah Wylie, Lewisville, Chester County, S.C. He
discusses the fortification of "The Gibralter of
the Mississippi Valley," Ft. Pillow, Tenn.,
where he is writing the first letter. Three
thousand Negroes, he says, together with a com-

pany or two of sanppers and miners, are busy at
work, and he predicts that Gen. Leonidas Polk
would spend thea Confederacy if he had it in his
hands. He mentions morale, sickness, vickets,
a eieukei etc. He declined the position of

 
Wylie, William 3
Assitant Commissary, since that would mean in-
sults end no fighting. Writing his second let=
ter from Columbus, Ky., he discusses the Confed-
erate victory in the Battle of Columbus (Sept. 3,
1861); Federal prisoners and casualties; skir-
mishes; robbery; "a great deal of sickness in
our regiment," principally of measles; etc,

 

Confederate soldier G.L, Strait on Sept. 9,
1861 mentions a skirmish by the 5th Regt. of
$.C., together with a battery from the Washing-
ton Artillery; Union battle casualties; Confed-
erate casualties due, in the soldier's opinion,

 
Wylie, William 4

 

to imprudence ¢?} in diet and improper medical
attention; morale; clothes; John Wylie; and
Uncle William, who is presumably Dr. William
Wylie. Strait's letter of Sept. 29, 1861 men-
tions Jenkins' Regt.; alleged Federal Army de-
predations; Gen. George McClellan; and the al-
leged invincibility of the South. The soldier's
letter of Mar. 31, 1863 mentions the Confederate
Army's failure to capture Spear's Pa. Cavalry;
and sickness among the men.

George Alden writes to Dr. William Wylie on
Apr. 9, 1863, mentioning his, Alden's, wife's

 
Wylie, William 5

 

travels in England and Scotland; his confidence
in Southern victory; and the late Federal at-
tack on Charleston, S.C.

G.L. Strait writes ca. May, 1863, mention-
ing Gen. Nathan Forrest's capture of Federal
Col. Abel D. Streight's force near Rome, Ga.
(May 3, 1863); Gens.,Lee, P.G.T. Beauregard,
Daniel Hill, William Rosecrans and Joseph Hook-
er; the Confederate Army of Northern Va.; the
Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg; and the 6th
Regt. (Confederate). The soldier predicts that
if Hooker is completely whipped the Army of

 
Wylie, William
Northern Va. will celebrate the coming 4th of
July in Maryland and Pennsylvania.
