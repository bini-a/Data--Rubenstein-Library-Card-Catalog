Ne Ce

 

John C. Gorman was captain of Company B, 2nd
North Carolina Infantry, Ramseur's Brigade,
Rodes' Division, Ewell's Corps, Army of Norther
Virginia, when he was wounded and captured on

May 19, 1864, during the Battle of Spotsylvania.
The three items in the collection are his manu-
script diary-memoir about his imprisonment, a
three-page description of Fort Delaware and its
prisoners, and a typescript of these first two

 
Gorman, John C, 2

items. The typescript (63 pp.) was apparently
made by Gorman's son, Thomas M. Gorman of
Durham, N. C., in 1911, and is a reliable and,
except for a few words misread here and there,
accurate copy of the diary. The three-page
description of Fort Delaware is, for the most

 

part, a copy, perhaps in John C. Gorman's hand,
of pages 25-27 of the diary-memoir. The diary-
memoir covers the period of May 14-Oct. 3, 1864.
The sections of the diary-memoir that are
written in the past tense do appear to have

 
Gorman, John C, 3

 

been written soon after the occurrence of the
events and experiences that Gorman describes.
The account begins with a description of the
Battle of Spotslvania and his wounding and cap-
ture. He then describes his trip to Old Capito
Prison in Washington, D. C., his incarceration

there, at Fort Delaware Prison, and at a hospi-
tal at Beaufort, S. C., on Port Royal Island.
He had been paroled to that hospital and was,
at the time the account ends, hoping to be ex-
changed. He writes of the treatment received

 
Gorman, John C. 4
by the Confederate prisoners at the hands of
Federal and "galvanized" Confederate guards.

The latter were former Confederate soldiers who
had taken the oath of allegiance to the Union.
The housing, food, clothing, health, amusements,
and religious services of the prisoners in camp

 

and when being transported from one location to
another are described.

Gorman took particular note of the relations
between the whites and blacks on Port Royal
Island and of disparaging rumors about Northern

 
Gorman, John C,

 

women schoolteachers on the island.

Dr. Lenox D. Baker of Durham, N. C., re-
ported on 1-10-83, that he had given Speed-
Gorman family papers other than this diary to
the Danville (Va.) Historical Society. See
also the Joseph Anderson Speed Papers in this
department.

Mostly papers pertaining to The Life of Alge
non Charles Swinburne (1917) by Edmund William
Gosse (1849-1928), English author, critic, tran
lator, librarian, teacher and editor, He was
made C, B, in 1912 and knighted in 1925. He
wrote the sketch on Swinburne (1837-1909) for the
D. N. Be, 1901-1911 supplement.

In preparing his biography, Gosse corresponded
with many persons who had known the poet, includ
ing authors, professors, and the poet's relative
friends, and former schoolmates in Eton College

 

 
osse, Sir Edmund William a
and Oxford University, and other contemporaries.
Gosse's life of Swinburne was more or less
completed in or before 1915. (See Lord Redes-
dale's letter of Aug. 1, 1915. ) But there re-
mained gaps which he attempted to fill--hence a
number of letters to him in 1915-1917. The pro-
blem was made difficult by the uneventfulness of

 

much of Swinburne’s life, the failing memories of
the poet's surviving contemporaries, and the
restrictions imposed upon the biographer concern-
ing the less edifying aspects of his subject's
terrestial existence,

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 3
Since some of the letters to Gosse are dated
not long before the publication of the biography
in April, 1917, and some of them afterward, he
had little or no time to incorporate this mate-
rial into his volume. The information contained
in the letters often tends to be fragmentary and
gossipy. Some of the writers repeat hearsay and
are vague about dates. Gosse included some of
this material into his book with the results that
might have been expected, a conversational,
hand-to-mouth narrative with too little of either
cold, hard biographical facts or incisive litera

 

 
osse, Sir Edmund William 4
riticism. The information concerning the poet's
alcoholic and sexual experiences, contained in
this collection wee omitted from the Life.
Consequently, it ishardly surprising that bot
the critics and the public, upon the whole,
eceived the book with some disappointment, or
that Gosse himself wrote, "If I could, I would
ithdraw the whole book and re-write it from
beginning to end." (See Sir Evan Edward Chart-
eris, The Life and Letters of Sir Edmund Gosse
(1931), p. 407.)
Curiously, there is little about World War I

 

 

 
osse, Sir Edmund William
in this collection, though most of the correspon-
dence falls in that period, and less about Thomas
ames Wise (1859-1937), whom Gosse thanks most

of all in his Preface, and who collaborated with
the biographer in editing the poet's works,

The first item in the correspondence is a

New York Tribune clipping of Nov. 27, 1875, con-
taining a letter of Nov. 9 from Swinburne to Miss
Sara Sigourney Rice, Director of the Edgar Allan
oe Memorial Committee in Baltimore, where the
nackneyéd subject of Poe's neglected grave had
been receiving considerable, albeit belated,

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 6
public attention. Poe's European reputation,
affirms Swinburne, is already deeply rooted and
is still growing. Baudelaire had translated
Poe's prose works. Mallarme was translating
his poems, while Manet was providing the illus-
trations.
Swinburne on Dec. 19, 1877, thanks Mrs.

 

E. L. (C.) Moulton for highly complimentary MS.
concerning him.

The next letter, dated Oct. 6, 1878, comes to
Swinburne from Miss Alice L. Bird, sister of Dr.
George Bird, whom she mentions, together with

 
Z

 

married Burton (1821-1890) in the doctor's house
, 1860. The Capt. was later to win
ame by his translation of Arabian Nights 1885-
L888).
It was in the winter of 1885-1886 that Burton

 

as notified that he was going to be knighted.
hile he never was, actually, he is, never the-
less generally referred to as Sir Richard Burton
and his wife as Lady Isabel Burton. Miss Bird

n her letter discusses Swinburne's dedication to

 
osse,sir Edmund William
Burton of his Poems and Ballads: Second Series,
published in June, 1878.

Alfred Lord Tennyson (1809-1892) writes to
Swinburne in Aug. 1891 that he has always admired
him and thanking him for his "Birthday Song."

Writing from his home,"The Pines," on May 7,
1893, Swinburne discusses a literary matter with

 

 

H. J. C. Cust (1861-1917), a Member of the Britid
House of Commons then connected with the Pall
Mall Gazette. A newspaper clipping of Feb. 21,
1896 from the London Daily Chronicle, attached
to the letter, may or ‘eo. deal with it.

 

 

 
osse, Sir Edmund William 9
winburne carefully explains in his letter that
his recent declination to contribute to the
Gazette, though courteous, was nonetheless deci-
Sive, and goes on to>-point out one very suffi-
cient reason for his not contributing. On Apr.

6 a long anonymous letter had scurrilously attac-
ked the poet's friend, Water Theodore Watts

 

(1832-1914), known as Walter Theodore Watts-Dun-
ton from 1896 until his death. Swinburne resents
Whe accusation that Watts, the intimate friend of
the late Lord Tennyson and of the present (i.e.
as of the date of the letter) Lady Tennyson's

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 10

 

aunt, Miss Mary Boyle, had written about them
Without authority, as a self-advertising outside
gossip-monger.

Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) writes to Swinburne
on Apr. 1, 1897, in thanks for his kind note
about one of his tales and in a more extended
appreciation of Swinburne's own writings.

The London Times Literary Supplement of Aug.

19, 1920 carries a letter by Prof. H. G. Fiedler,
enclosing Swinburne's letter to him of Feb. 12,
Both letters deal with a minor literary

An interesting letter of Nov. 15, 1911 is by

. G. C, Liddell (1846-1920), a barrister serving
BS Asst. Sec. in the Lord Chancellor's Office
pnd as Private Sec. to the Lord Chancellor. A
younger contemporary of Swinburne, Liddell had
Ollowed him to Eton and Oxford and adopted him
AS the poet of his youth. The Barrister has read
osse's life of the poet with tremendous interest’
resumably he means the sketch for the D. N. B.,

or more than verbal accuracy of description.

A first cousin, once removed, of Swinburne,
iss E. Hope Lowry obligingly writes to Gosse on
Apr. 24 and 28, 1912 about her family. She is
he daughter of Gen. Robert William Lowry (1824-

 

1905), British Army, and Mrs. Emily (Ward) Lowry.
rs. Lowry was a first cousin of the poet and the
haughter of Sir Henry George Ward (1797-1860) and
ady Emily Elizabeth (Swinburne) Ward ( -1882)
ho had married in 1824, Lady Ward was the sistey

 
osse, Sir Edmund William 143

 

bf Admiral Charles Henry Swinburne (1797-1877),
oyal Navy, who was the father of the poet.

The Admiral was the son of Sir John Edward
Swinburne (1762-1860), Sixth Baronet; and the
usband of Lady Jane Henrietta Ashburnham (
1896), whom he married in 1836. She was the _
Haughter of the Third Earl of Ashburnham, George
Ashburnham (1761-1830).

Miss E, Hope Lowry is the sister of a Col.

and of Admiral Sir

obert Swinburne Lowry (1854-1920), Royal Navy.
iss Lowry relates that her father, Gen. BR. W.

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 14
Lowry often told her how his first cousin-in-law,
the young Algernon Charles Swinburne, used to
stand upon a chair and recite both Byron's poems
and his own with passionate fervor, then jump
down and ask the Gen. which he preferred. The
Gen.'s widow remembers how Algernon's father used
to toss him out to the waves. Miss Lowry recalls

 

an anecdote about the poet's mother; and the time
that Algernon sent a set of his works to her sick
but heroic, brother, Commander Arthur Lowry,

Royal Navy, with the inscription "from one who is
proud to be his kinsman." She also remarks upon

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 15
the poet's meeting Louis Napoleon; and the illness
of his sister, Miss Isabel Swinburne (18...-1915)
One of the finest letters in the collection,
even though it is only fragmentary, is by the
poet's first cousin, contemporary, and Eton
College schoolmate, Algernon Bertram Freeman-
itford (1837-1916), First Baron Redesdale, of
edesdale, in Northumberland, in the second
creation, better known as Lord Redesdale. This
letter, dated May 10, 1912, and addressed to
Grosse, is published in the latter's life of
winburne, pp. 317-323, after the biographer had

 

 
osse, Sir Edmund William 15a
irstdulyBowdlerized (a practice inferentially
ondemned in the letter itself) His Lordship's
remarks by omitting the name of Oscar Browning
(1837-1923), who allegedly nad made poisonous
remarks about the poet. An added paragraph in
osse's handwriting is added at the end of the
MS. with a line indicating that it is to be

 

inserted before the last paragraph in the letter,
It is there in the printed volume, pp. 322-323.
Lord Redesdale writes on Apr. 24, 1913, to
Miss Isabel Swinburne, his first cousin and
sister of the pa@t, assuring her that his inti-

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 16
mate friend, Gosse, will write nothing to offend
those to whom her brother was dear.

An author who knew Victor Hugo intimately and
possessed many letters from him, Julian Osgood
Field, discusses Swinburne in a letter to Gosse
on Apr. 25, 1913. Field had known Swinburne,
too, "in the Autumn of his wicked days," i. e.,
before "Consule Watts" ushered him into the
three-decade "reign of respectability" (1879-1909
which to Field, savored of sequestration. Swin-
burne's few letters to Field had been lost years
ago. Field criticizes James Douglas (1867-1940),

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William i?
ho had in 1904 published a book about Watts-
Dunton (who had become hyphenated eight years
before); and declares that Swinburne labored unde
the delusion that Hugo admired him. Field says
that Hugo absolutely ignored Swinburne. But

see Bosse's biography, p. 185. Field adds that
Hugo was the greatest Cabotin that ever existed
and seems to be the only great poet who never
was in love and who hated music. He regarded
himself as a demigod.

Sir Sidney Lee writes to Gosse on July 7,

1914, about Swinburne, Watts-Dunton, and Thomas
Nabbes,.

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 18

On Oct. 30, 1914, A. W. H. Hedderwick writes
about publishing and library matters.

Coulson Kernahan (1858-1943) writes to Gosse
in 1914 about Swinburne and others. He mentions
the Omar Khayyam Club and Edward Fitzgerald
(1809-1883), who translated The Rubaiyat of Omar

He also mentions Watts-Dunton, James

 

 

(1867-1940), Sir William Robertson
, Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-
, Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936), Henry Austin
Dobson (1840-1921) and the First Earl Roberts
(1832-1914), under whom he was doing some soldie-
ring in the First all World War.

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William

James Bryce (1838-1922), First Viscount
Bryce, an Oxford U. schoolmate of Swinburne,
writes to Gosse on Mar. 5, 1915, enclosing a frag
mentary typed copy of the addressee's life of
Swinburne. Bryce's pencilled annotations on
this copy were used in Gosse's biography.

An interesting note on Swinburne's connection

 

with Balliol College, Oxford U., which he atten-
ded appears in a letter of Apr. 21, 1915, by the
Master of this college, Prof. James Leigh Stra-
chan-Davidson (1843-1916), and is incorporated
into Gosse's volume, p. 65n.

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 20
Another Oxford professor, Robert William
Raper (1842-1915), writes to Gosse twice in July,

1915, discussing Robert Browning (1812-1899),
Sir Courtenay Peregrine Ilbert (1841-1924),
Benjamin Jowett (1817-1893), Walter Savage Lan-

of animals also comes in for discussion.

During the same month, the publisher, Sir
Frederick Orridge Macmillan (1851-1936), writes

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 21
to Gosse about publishing the life of Swinburne
and the latter's posthumous poems.

Lord Redesdale writes on Aug. 1, 1915, to his
eousin, Mrs. M. C. J. (G.) Leith, who wrote
under the pen name of "Mrs, Disney Leith." He
discusses the life of their mutual first cousin,
Swinburne, which had been written, though not

 

yet published, by Gosse, and appeals to her for
help, particularly for information about the
poet's two years between his attendance at Eton
College and Oxford U.

Prof. James Fitzmaurice-Kelly (1858-1923) on

 
osse, Sir Edmund William 22

 

Aug. 2, 1915 narrates an amusing story about
Jowett and Swinburne.

Lord Redesdale on Aug. 14 writes to Gosse,
enclosing Mrs. Leith's annotations on the life
of Swinburne. There is a copy of her letter to
Lord Redesdale.

A letter of Oct. 10, 1915, to Gosse is by Dr.

Francis Warre Warre-Cornish (1839-1916), a for-
mer “form fellow" of Swinburne at Eton College
and Vice-Provost of the College at the time of
his death. He remembers that the poet was poin-
ted out to him as "Mad Swinburne" in 1853 at the

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William a)
school. He discusses other matters, including
the poet's Commemoration Ode of 1891 for the
Eton Jubilee.

John Morley (1838-1923), First Viscount Mor-
ley of Blackburn, writes to Gosse about the
biography of Swinburne, which Morley had read,
in part at least. Gosse has a note on this let-
ter. See also the Preface to the published life,

omitted from the list. This question is discuss
in some of the other letters.) Holland's letter
includes an anecdote (not to be printed) about
an unnamed professor and the actress, Miss Adah
Isaacs Menken.

 

On Nov. 3 Holland mentions Miss Menken again,
and the wife of the Rev. William Stubbs (1825-19
afterward Bishop of Chester and still later of
Oxford.

Miss Alice L. Bird writes to Gosse on Nov. 24

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 26

‘ Lor S.] Minto writes from Aberdeen
on Jan. 12, 1916, to Prof. J. L. Strachan-David-
son about the papers of William Bell Scott (1811-

An English author who is a second cousin of
Swinburne, Richard Bagot (1860-1921), writes
from Bologna, Italy, on Jan. 21, 1916 to Gosse
about his famous kinsman and their families.

He mentions Sir Edwin Arnold (1832-1904).

Sir Charles Theodore Hagberg Wright (1862-
1940) on May 9 informs Gosse about the Newdigate
Prize which Swinburne had tried and failed to win
at Oxford U. in 1858. (It may have bean 1857.

The letters disagree about this point.) .

Falconer Madan (1851-1935), of the Bodleian
Library at Oxford U., writes to Gosse on July 17,

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 28
1916, about an incident involving Swinburne's
visit to the aforementioned library in 1891.
Madan also discourses upon Robert Bridges' (1844-
1930) criticism of Robert Browning and includes
two lines of verse by Bridges probably not found
in his collected writing.

Charles Haddon Chambers (1860-1921) writes to

 

Gosse on Dec. 10, 1916, enclosing a letter on
Swinburne's intoxication by William Lestocq

heard Swinburne declaim upon Charles Dickens
(1812-1870) in a London public house late at
night more than 20 years before.

A letter of Dec. 28 is to Gosse from Sir

discussing Swinburne pictures, Thomas James Wise'g
(1859-1937) cartoons, etc.

Prof. Andrew Cecil Bradley (1851-1935) writes

f Two letters to Gosse are by Lady Anne Isabelg
(Thackeray ) Ritchie (1837-1919), wife of Sir
Richmond Thackeray Willoughby Ritchie (1854-1912)
He was a first cousin once removed, of William
Makepeace, Thanckeray (1811-1863), while she was
the daughter of the latter and wrote under the
pen name of "Mrs. R. Ritchie." In her first

 

letter, written in or before 1917, she mentions

a discussion of Swinburne between her father and
Lord Houghton. She also mentions Edmund Venables
(1819-1895), James Spedding (1808-1881), and
William Thomson (1819-1890), Archbishop of York.
See Gosse's Life, (at: pp. 95-96.

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William a1
Among Gosse's correspondents furnishing info
mation about Swinburne is Miss Janet H. Blunt,
who writes on Jan, 21 and 25, Feb. 16, and March
6, 1917. Attached to the fourth letter, in Gosse'g
handwriting, is a letter to Miss Blunt from Sig-
mora Annunziata Fronduti (ca. 1833-19__), of Gubs
bio, Umbria, Italy, who narrates her two encoun-

 

ters with Swinburne and comments upon his person-
ality and knowledge of Italian and French liter-
ature. Miss Blunt in her letters discusses var-
ious people, including Miss Elizabeth Sewell and
Lord Houghton. Miss Sewell was the sister of

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William BY
illiam Sewell (1804-1874), Warden of Radley.

See pp. 337-338 in Gosse's life.

R. Woodgate mentions Swinburne's visit to
Radley on Jan. 27, 1917.

Henry Sewell, perhaps a relative of the
foregoing Sewells, discusses Swinburne's visit
to Radley--(Letter of Jan. 28, 1917).

 

The Rev. Charles E. Rivers, M. A., Oriel
College, Oxford U., writes to Gosse on Feb. 8
about Pringle Nichol, son of Prof. John Nichol
and possessor of many Swinburne letters. The
professor was anxious, lest the letters fall into

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 33
the hands of Watts-Dunton, who, he felt, had
exploited the poet.

Pringle Nichol is the brother of Mrs. Luch
(Nichol) Jack, Her husband was Adolphus Alfred
Jack (1868-1946), Prof. of English Literature
in the U. of Aberdeen (1915-1937). Pringle
Nichol himself writes to Gosse on Feb. 12 ,

 

offering to let-him use the Swinburne letters,
but not offering to let the public know everythig
about the poet's private life. John Nichol is
supposed to have been Swinburne's most intimate
friend until Rossetti, et al. came up to decorate

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 34
the Union. There is some criticism of Watts-
Dunton.

Pringle Nichol writes on Feb. 22 that his
sister, who has reminded him of her ownership of
the Swinburne Papers, does not like their being
printed. Pringle Nichol himself adds that only
"elegant extracts" from these papers are possiblé
He relates some aneCdotes about Swinburne, men-
tioning Hugo in one of them.

Pringle Nichol writes to Gosse on Mar. 5,
enclosing some copies of Swinburne's letters
(not in this collection) and Mrs. Jack's notes.

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William
Prof. A. V. Dicey is mentioned in both the letter
and the enclosure. Prof Benjamin Jowett is
mentioned in the enclosure. Nichol writes more
on the 6th about the Swinburne Papers.

Writing to Gosse from Dublin on Feb. 16, 1917
Judge Dodgson Hamilton Madden (1840-1928) en-
closes a letter he had received from Swinburne

 

(not included in this collection) and mentions
his own diary, Swinburne and Dickens.

Upon publication of Gosse's life of Swin-
burne in Apr. 1917, a number of congratulatory
letters, along with some critical ones, were
written.

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 36
Arthur Clutton-Brock (1868-1924), who had written
a favorable review of the biography, congratu-
lates Gosse and praises his book very highly.
The reviewer has a higher opinion than the bio-
grapher of Swinburne's later poetry.

Prof. Sir Thomas Erskine Holland ventures a
few corrections to Gosse's biography on Apr. 3,

 

1917. Lord Bryce on the 5th thanks Gosse for the
copy of the biography and praises the portrait
and the story of the poet. Bryce, commenting
upon Swinburne's character, states that he never
seemed to have much love for liberty, that his

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 37
love for Italy was doubtful, that his Armada
pours needless scorn upon the Irish, and that in
his admiration of men, like Victor Hugo and
Guiseppe Mazzini (1805-1872), there was something
of the 15th century idea that you must have a
lady to adore, its not mattering much what she wa
when you had made her your object of worship,
because imagination did the rest. Lord Morley
also writing on the 5th [?], likewise praises
Gosse,

There is a complimentary letter of the 6th
from Sir George Otto Trevelyan (1838-1928), men-

 

 
osse, Sir Edmund William 38
tioning not only the life of Swinburne, but
other books, including the life of Sir Walter

cott by that writer's son-in-law, John Gibson

ockhart (1794-1854).

Holland writes again on the 10th about the
second edition of the life of Swinburne, Pringle
Nichol, and the "Old Mortatlity" literary society,

On the 20th Sir William Robertson Nicoll
acknowledges receipt of Gosse's letter and re-
tracts a phrase which Gosse had evidently found
objectionable. Nicoll goes on to discuss Swin-
burne and to praise Gosse,

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 39

Theodore Wratislaw, who had also written on
Swinburne, writes to Gosse on the 20th to praise
his work on the subject, to relate two visits to
Swinburne and Watts-Dunton, and to mention Mrs.
Leigh, George Moore (1852-1933), and an unfavo-
rable review of Gosse's biography by James
Douglas, (1867-1940).

On the 20th, too, Sir Adolphus William Ward
(1837-1924) congratulates Gosse upon his admira-
ble biography and goes on the narrate a Swinburne
anecdote.

The 23rd brings a complimentary letter to

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 40
Gosse from Sir Courtenay Peregrine Ilbert, who
procedes to reminisce. He had met Swinburne at
Jowett's House. There they had met Hippolyte
Taine (1828-1893), who commented upon Sir H.
Johnston. George Eliot (1819-1880) and Yeorge
Henry Lewes (1817-1878), Ilbert recalls, dis-
mayed Jowett by insisting upon going to hear him

 

preach in Balliol Chapel. For convenience of
hearing, Lewes squatted himself upon the cushion
where devout persons kneel for sacramental pur-
poses. Ilbert recalls that J. A. Symonds was not
in "Old Mortality" but another society. He

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William Al
quotes a stanza of a Latin hymn by Swinburne. He
mentions Walter H. Pater, W. B. Scott, and the
Surviving sisters of R. W. Raper.

H, C, Marks writes to C. H. Chambers on Apr.
24 about some Swinburne letters. A note from
Chambers to Gosse is attached to this letter,
while a letter of the 25th from Chambers to Gosse
encloses both Marks' letter and Chambers' note.
Two or three of Swinburne's letters, says Cham-
bers, are to Auguste Vacquerie. Chambers admires
all of Gosse's biography, except Appendix III,
George Moore's letter. He quotes two lines of

Swinburne's poetry. gs

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 42

 

Ilbert writes on Apr. 28 that he was a member
of "Old Mortality." He goes on to discuss Lord
Bryce, Swinburne, W. B. Scott, R. W. Raper,
Charles Bowen, et al.

Mrs. Maria Margaret (La Primaudaye) Pollen
(d. 1919), widow of John Hungerford Pollen, Sr.
(1820-1902), artist and author, writes to Gosse

on May 5, expressing appreciation for his remarks
about her late husband on p. 106 of his life of
Swinburne, and discussing the poet and George
Burne-Jones.

Another letter about Gosse's biography, dated

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 43

 

ay 19 and mostly complimentary is by James Ber-
trand de Vinchelés Payen-Payne (1866-1945), son
of James Bertrand Payen-Payne (1833-1898). The
younger Payen-Payne points out some of Gosse's
errors in dealing with his father, and mentions
Sir Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch (1863-1944),

G. Rossetti, W. M. Rossetti, and Lord Redesdale.

On May 22, 1917 Archibald Young Campbell
(d. 1885) discusses Swinburne and mentions his
own father-in-law, Prof. James Ward.

Trevelyan praises Gosse's biography, correc-
tly guesses that Oscar Browning was the name of

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William Ay

 

the man omitted from the Bowdlerized version of
Lord Redesdale's letter of May 10, 1912, to
Gosse, and discusses Swinburne; Miss Menken;
auline, Lady Trevelyan (d. 1866); and the anony-
mous reviewer (Lord Morley) in the Saturday Re-
wiew on Aug. 4, 1866.

Holland writes on May 28 that one remark
erroneously attributed to himself on p. 35 of
Gosse's biography should have been attributed to
G. B. N. Hill. Francis Law Latham (1837-1923),

ho had (actually or supposedly) defeated Swin-
burne for the Newdigate Prize in 1858 (or 1857)

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 45
became Advocate-General for Bengal in 1864. (For
different story about the prize, see Georges
Lafourcade, Swinburne (1932), pp. 62-63 and 637i.)

"Old Mortality" expired in the 1860's not in
1876 according to Holland. JIlbert and William
allace (1844-1897) are mentioned.

Robert Singleton Garnett (1866-1932), a
solicitor with an avocation To. literature,
addresses Gosse on the 3lst. W. M. Rossetti
had recently remarked that he had many letters
from Swinburne, and that many passages in them
were unfit for publication.

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William

On June 11, 1917, is a letter to Gosse from
Augustus George Vernon Harcourt (1834-1919),
sometimes known as Augustus Gddrge Vernon Har-
court. “ome of his Oxford U. Contemporaries are
discussed by Harcourt: Swinburne, T. H. Green,
A. V. Dicey, G. BR. Luke, T. E. Holland, F. W.
Warre-Cornish, Edwin Palmer, Walter Savage Lan-

 

dor, Robert Browning, and Prof, John Conington
(1825-1869).

Francis A. Welby writes on July 13 about
Miss Elizabeth Sewell and others.

Sir George Young (1837-1930), Third Baronet,

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 47
writes to Gosse on July 24 and 29 and Aug. 2.
Swinburne knew more Greek than Gosse and Lord
Redesdale allowed. Young disputes other evi-
dence of His Lordship. The poet and the Lord
were not very friendly. The former resented the
latter's patronizing airs.

Sir William Alexander Sim (1858-1928) writes
to Gosse on Aug. 3 from Florence, Italy, to
praise Gosse's biography and discuss various li-
terary matters. At the late Lady Leighton War-
ren's request, he had selected and prepared for
publication Orpheus in Thrace and Other Poems, a

 

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 48
posthumous volume, by the late John Byrne Leices-
ter Warren (1835-1895), Third Baron dé Tabley,
botanist, author, and numismatist. Sim appre-
ciates Gosse's kind words about the "selector"

in reviewing the book, and does not mind that

"E, L. W." received the crédit publicly. De
Tabley's work was improved by Gosse's revising

 

touch. R. S. Garnett writes again to Gosse
Sometime in 1917. He would like to obtain some
Swinburne letters for the biographer. He thinks
that his father, Richard Garnett (1835-1906),
received a few. He discusses the possibility of

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 49
getting some Swinburne letters from W. M. Rosset-
ti. The Shaen family, with which Garnett has
some connections, comes in for some discussion

in connection with Mazzini, whom Swinburne great
admired. William Shaen had been a friend of
Mazzini. Miss Margaret Josephine Shaen had re-
cently published a short memoir of her father,

 

William Shaen. The Shaen family may conceivably
have retained some Mazzini papers. If Gosse so
desires, Garnett will have his wife, Martha
(Soscoe) Garnett (1869-1946), ask Miss Shaen,
Swinburne letters to Mathilde Blind (1841-1896)

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 50
might be obtained. Sir Alfred Moritz Mond Mond
(1868-1930), First Baronet (afterwards Alfred
Moritz Mond Melchett, First Baron Melchett) and
Garnett are her two trustees. Swinburne, more-
over, May have written to the blind poet Philip
Bourke Marston (1850-1887), son of Dr. John
Westland Marston (1819-1890), the dramatist, poét
and critic. The elder Marston married Eleanor
Jane Potts, an aunt of Mrs. Olivia Narney (Sin-
gleton) Garnet, who was the mother of R. S. Gar-
nett. If Swinburne wrote to the younger Marston,
it may be possible to trace the letters through

 

 
osse, Sir Edmund William 51
the late Herbert Edwin Clarke, who was the elder
Marston's executor.

Sir George Brisbane Douglas (1856-1935),
Fifth Baronet, writes to Gosse on Apr. 18, ca.
1917 L[?], complimerting him on his life of Swin-
burne. Sympathy never stultified Gosse as it
did the present Lord Tennyson (Hallam Tennyson

 

(1852-1928), Second Baron Tennyson) in writing
the life of his father, Alfred, Lord Tennyson.
He discusses William Sharp (1855 or 1856-1905),
Miss Menken, Oscar Browning (who, as Douglas
knows, has been expurgated from Lord Redesdale's
letter of May 10, — |

A person who signs himself "C" and who may be
Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes (1858-1945),
pecond Baron Houghton and First Marquess of Crewe

rites an interesting letter to Gosse in 1917[?].
"C" admires Gosse's life of Swinburne, expecially
Chapter V, which deals with the Victorian era.
"C" eloquently denounces the Victorian itiiasma

ith its filthy pruderies, its nullifying virtues
its decorous proprieties, and its vacuous con-
ventions; and credits Swinburne with doing more
than his share in ridding the British of these

unpleasantnesses,

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 53

An American scholar who was later to publish
a book on Swinburne, Dr. Samuel Claggett Chew,Jdr.
(b. 1888), praises Gosse's biography on Feb. 18,
1918, and inquires at some length about Swinburs.
ne's The Duke of Gandia. Chew is going to send
the biographer an"“offprint" of his detailed
review of Gosse's Life, Mrs. Leith's volume, and
Swinburne's Posthumou$S Poems.

There is a letter of Mar. 12 to Gosse from
Lt. Col. F. Hugh L. Oldham (b. 1876), of the
British Army. He mentions a large autograph
collection that had belonged to his father, the

 

 

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 54

 

late Venerable Algernon Langston Oldham (d.1916),
Archdeacon of Ludlow from 1904 to 1913. While
the larger part of the collection now belongs
to the writer's brother, there is some interes-
ting material including a Keats MS., in the
smaller part belonging to the writer. Oldham
encloses a copy of a letter of Mar. [?],1862 to
Ruskin from Swinburne, who says he will be 25
in April. He discusses his own writings and the
personal relations between himself and Ruskin.
Miss Kate Stephens (1853-1938) writes to
Gosse on Oct. 12, enclosing a newspaper clipping

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 55
(missing from this collection); a photostat of
Swinburne's letter of June 12, 1898 to her; and
a photostat of Swinburne's envelope. It was
presumably in 1898 that Miss Stephens had sent
Swinburne a copy of A Young Scholar's Letters,
Being A Memoir of Byron Caldwell Smith (1897).
Smith (1849-1877) and Miss Stephens had exchanged
love letters (published in 1919). Both Swin-
burne's and Miss Stephens' letters speak of
Smith's early (1868) appraisal of Swinburne's
early peoms. Swinburne thinks that this is the
best appraisal of them that he has ever read.

 

 

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 56

 

Walter Bradford Woodgate (1840-1920) sends
Gosse three letters and some notes on Swinburne
in Jan., 1919. He mentions Sir Henry Oldham and
others.

Lady Anne Ritchie has a letter of 1917-1919
to Gosse about Swinburne and Watts-Dunton. Yhe
admits having spitefully abused the latter, who
helped Swinburne at first and then seemed to
think that he poet belonged to him. She tells
an anecdote about Swinburne and Watts-Dunton.

There is an undated letter from Robert Louis
Stevenson (1850-1894) to Gosse. Sir Edward

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 57

 

Coley Burne-Jones (1833-1898) comes in for some
comment and Robert Burns (1759-1796) for more.
William Sharp writes an undated letter to
Swinburne about literary matters, mentioning
Bernhard, Freiherr Von Tauchnitz (1816-1895).
The miscellany folder in this collection
contains chiefly notes, by Bosse and others, on

the life of Swinburne. Sometimes it is impossi-
ble to tell where one note leaves off and anothe
begins,

An item of Nov. 16, 1911, lists pictures of

the poet.

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 58

 

Gosse's note of Aug., 1913, contains a story
by George Nathaniel Curzon (1859-1925), First
Marquess Curzon of Kedlestone. In 1878, when
visiting Prof. John Nichol in Glasgow, Swinburne
became extremely intoxicated. Nichol’ ‘poured him
into bed, locked the bedroom door on the outside
and listened. A few moments later Swinburne

tried to get out and failed. After a while the
poet exclaimed, "Oh my God! And he [Nichol] a
petulant provincial pedagogue, and I a poet of
world-wide reputation!"

There is a note on an article in The New

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 59

 

Statesman (Mar. 25, 1916), by Edward Verral
Lucas (1868-1938), dealing with Swinburne. (See
Sir Evan Edward Charteris (1864-1936), The Life
and Letters of Sir Edmund Gosse (1931), p. 487,
Wherein F. L., instead of E. V., Lucas is
erroneously mentioned. )

Two anonymous sheets, written in 1916, com-
ment on the draft of Gosse's Life. Names men-
tioned include Ruskin, Jowett, Lord Redesdale,
Byron, Shelly, Oscar Browning, Matthew Arnold
(1822-1888), Alfred Edward Housman (1859-1936),
Sir George Young, William Hurrell Mallock (1849.

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 60
1923), F. W. Warre-Cornish, Prof. Ingram Bywater,
the Rev. Dr, William Walrond Jackson (1838-1931),
and Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (1848- 1918)
First Baronet.

Gosse has some notes on May 14, 1917, about
Mrs. Pollen's recollections of her husband; Swin-
burne; Lord Houghton; D. G. Rossetti; Mrs. Leigh;
et al. Mrs. Pollen is related to the Swinburne's
throu igh the Bowdens. Their common cousin, Fathe
Sebastian Bowden, is mentioned.

A note by Edith Helen Sichel (1862-1914)
narrates her one brief encounteti with Swinburne.

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 61

 

A number of the miscellaneous items lack
Signatures, dates, and places. One example of
such recounts seeing Swinburne twic® with Jowett
at Oxford.

There is a short poem, entitled "Cloacina,"
by Swinburne, which is perhaps an attack upon
Henry Peter Brougham (1778-1868), First Baron
Brougham and Vaux.

The poet is discussed in a typed fragment of
The Education of Henry Adams, by Henry Brooks
Adams (1838-1918).

Swinburne is discussed in a short, undated

 

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 62
memorandum by Sir Sidney Carlyle Cockerell

(b. 1867). There are a Swinburne anecdote from
William Morris and another anecdote about the
poet's dealings to Cabmen. Morris, Swinburne,
and Sir Edward Coley Burne-Jones figure in anothae
story. Burne-Jones told Cockerell that he had
deliberately destroyed all his letters from

 

Swinburne, Ruskin, and others.

The remainder of the Miscellany folder «.is
in a smaller folder marked "Dr. [Richard] Gar-
nett [1835-1906)--British Museum," containing
mostly notes by Gosse and others on Swinburne.

Garnett was the keeper of printed books in the
Museum.

An anecdote about Swinburne and Jowett is
included in Gosse's Life, pp. 57-58

A note by Edward Henry Blakeney (b. 1869)
discusses some correspondence he had with Swin-
burne,

There is a short Swinburne poem, "What Is
the Good of a Teuton," in Gosse's handwriting,
ith the note "Swinburne, from Sir Philip Burne-
Jones."

Mrs. Leith's note about Swinburne says that

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 64

 

he read with the Rev. Dr. James Russell Woodford
(1820-1885), afterwards Bishop of Ely; and also
with the Rev. Dr. William Stubbs (1825-1901),
Bishop, successively, of Chester and of Oxford.
In 1857 the poet made a trip to Germany with

his uncle, Gen. Thomas Ashburnham, C. B., of the
British Army.

Another note deals with Thomas Hill Green,
Swinburne's schoolmate at Oxford U. and later
White's Prof. of Moral Philosophy there; and
Felice Orsini (1819-1858), Italian revolutionist
and Mazzini associate, who in Jan., 1858 unsuc-

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 65
cessfully attempted to assassinate Louis Napoleon
but succeeded in killing and injuring several
other persons. Swinburne (who hated Napoleon
and admired Mazzini and Orsini) had the sympathy
of Green about Orsini and the Austrian posses-
Sion of Italy, according to the note. Green is
quoted as saying that the ideal was the maximum of
power for all members of human society alike to
make the best of themselves.

There is a copy of a poem, "An Election,"
written by Swinburne ca. 1879-1880 in connection
with the Midlothian campaign, attacking William

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 66

 

Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898).

A note mentions Swinburne's praise of Aes-
chylus, Milton, and Hugo, and his dispraise of
Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wilde (1856-1900).

Another note mentions Swinburne, William
Morris, and G. B. N. Hill.

Swinburne's "Boat Song," in Gosse's hand-
writing, is said by Gosse to be very early.
(Another paper contains a variation, in French,
of the first verse of "Boat Song.") In Gosse's
handwriting, too, is a fragment of Swinburne's
blasphemous poem, "The Sorrows of Joseph," com-

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 67
posed ca. 1876. Gosse, in this connection, men-
ea Bywater, and Sir Edwin Ray Lankester (1847-
1929).

A story about Swinburne and the devils is
told to Gosse by Herbert Coulstoun Gardner (1846-
1921), First Baron Burghclere of Walden, who
mentions &@ Mrs. Greville; her brother, Sir

 

Deighton Probyn; William Hillier Onslow (1853-
1911), Fourth Earl of Onslow; and Countess Flo-
rence Coulstoun (Gardner) Onslow.

A four-page memorandum discusses Swinburne's
membership in the Anthropological Society of

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 68

 

London and, in more detail, its offshoot, the
Catitlibal Club. Dr. James Hunt (1833-1869),
President of the Society, became President of
the Club. Swinburne became one of the last of
the Foundation Fellows of the Society; in 1865,
and immediately joined the Club.

During a discussion in 1868, Swinburne con-
trasted American and English literary men:
Washington Irving's compositions were Joseph
Addison and water; and those of Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, Tennyson and water; but one American
poet exhibited a special peculiarity not taken

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 69

 

from any European model, viz., Edgar Allan Poe,
hose works he had always admired. There might
be better writers in Europe, butSwinburne knew
mone. Walt Whitman's compositions were undoub-
tedly superior. America had a new spring of in-
tellectual power. In Ralph Waldo Emerson there
is a certain impression of European feeling, but

also a distinctive feeling, not European at all.
American intellectuality is an original distinct
mative product, not derivative from any other
country. Apart from literature, America had
solved the great problem of Democracy, which

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 70
Europe had not yet succeeded in doing.

Other members of the Club included Thomas
Bendyshe and Sir Richard Burton. A part of a
letter from Swinburne to Burton ca. Feb., 1871,
mentions Simeon Solomon (1841-1905). A four-
page memorandum, in Gosse's handwriting, quotes

 

at length from a discussion of Swinburne by

Guy de Maupassant (1850-1893), who had encount-
ered the poet at Etretat, France, in the fall
of 1868. This memorandum is taken from de Mau-
passant's Preface to Gabriel Mourey's transla-
tion of Swinburne's Poems and Ballads (1891).

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William she

In another memorandum Gosse discusses Richard
Holt Hutton (1826-1897) and George Meredith (1828
1909). See also the Life, pp. 93-94.

On Feb. 9, 1914, is a Gosse memorandum of
Lord Redesdale's remarks. Lady Katherine Ash-
burnham, who afterwards married Sir Alexander
Bannermann, was Swinburne's favorite cousin.

 

Gosse in another memorandum says that Swin-
burne introduced James Abbot McNeill Whistler
(1834-1903) to D. G. Rossetti.

Another Gosse memorandum deals with an
article by Jean Lorrain; George Powell; and Ed-

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William

mond Huot de Goncourt (1822-1896). Nothing in
the article, concludes Gosse, has any relation
to Swinburne.

The last group of memoranda in the miscel-
lany folder contains much information of Swin-
burne's life. Names mentioned include Thomas
Hardy, Mrs. Charlotte (Bronte) Nicholls (1816-
1855), Lord Morley, Joseph Knight, Thomas Purnell
(1834-1889), Ford Madox Brown (1821- 1893),
Andrew Chatto, Maurice Maeterlinck (1862- 1949),
Mortimer Collins (1827-1876), D. G. Rossetti,
John Thomson, Lady Jane Henrietta (Ashburnham)

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 23
Swinburne, Edward Swinburne, Lord Redesdale,

Miss Isabel Swinburne, Mrs. Leith, Byron, W. T.
Watts-Dunton, Miss Alice Swinburne, Lord Hough-
ton, John Nichol, Spartali, Ebenezer Jones (1820-
1860), Henry Savile Clark, John Camden Hotten
(1852-1873), Robert Browning, Dr. Frederick James
Furnivall (1825-1910), George Robert Sims (1847-
1922), and Miss Adah Isaacs Menken.

One note discusses two long Poems on flag-
gelation by Swinburne. Gosse's note of Apr. 27,
1917, based upon an interview that day with
G. R, Sims, discusses Swinburne, John Thompson,

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William

 

D. G. Rossetti, Miss Menken, et al.

Thomson, at D. G. Rossetti's suggestion,
introduced Swinburne to Miss Menken. Sims also
told Gosse that Swinburne's Songs Before Sunrise
were written on a bench in Regent's Park. On
his way from Dorset Place to St. John's Wood,
the poet used to stop there and write down what
he had composed,

The two remaining items in the miscellany
folder are an autograph by Swinburne and a
photograph of a picture of Jesus and others.
Perhaps D. G. Rossetti painted the original. In

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 75
any event, the photograph is by Sir Emery Walker.
The fourth and last folder contains printed
material and facsimiles (1857-1917), mostly of
Swinburne's works, but also a few book reviews.
Several of Swinburne's publications are
anonymously reviewed in The London Quarterly
Review, XXXI (Jan., 1869), 370-401.
Lord Morley reviews Swinburne's tragedy,
, in Macmillan's Magazine, XXX (Oct.,
521-529). It is much more favorable than
his review of Poem and Ballads in 1866.
The Edinburgh Review, .CXIV (July, 1876),

 

 

 

 

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 76

 

147-168, anonymously praises, with reservations
the Swinburnian tragedy, Erechtheus.

Sir William Robertson Nicoll discusses Swin-
burne's life and writings in The Contemporary
Review, XCV (May, 1909), 527-538.

Gosse has an undated review of Swinburne's
drama, Locrine.

"Swinburne and His Imitators," some stanzas
from an unpublished poem, appears in an undated
mewspaper clipping over the initials of W. W.,
who may be Sir William Watson (1858-1935).

A magazine clipping of 1909 has a note on

 

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 72
Swinburne's recent death and a short poem by
Angela Gordon, entitled "In Memoriam: A. C. Swin-
burne."

A galley progf for the Bookman in 1917 con-
tains a review, by Robert Laurence Binyon (1869-
1943) of Gosse's life of Swinburne and of Mrs.
Leith's account of her cousin's boyhood.

 

There are two copies of a cartoon, by Sir
Edward Coley Burne-Jones, of Swinburne and Miss
Menken.

The rest of the items are chiefly the writing
of Swinburne in print, facsimile, and typescript.

 
Gossse, Sir Edmund William

 

Two facsimiles are of The Devil's Due (1875)
by "Thomas Maitland," a penname used here by
Swinburne, but ordinarily used by his enemy,
Bobert Williams Buchanan (1841-1901).

A number of the facsimiles portray the bin-
dings and title page of Swinburne's books and
pamphlets, including Rosamond (1857), Under the

 

Microscope (1872), A Word for the Navy (1887),
Robert Burns: A Poem (1896), and Lord Soulis
(1909). Some of these items were printed for
private circulation, e. g., Letters from...
Swinburne to T. J. Wise (1909).

 

 

 

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William 79
A typed copy of a letter of Jan. 15, 1878,
from Swinburne to Paul Hamilton Hayne (1830-1886)

was transferred to the Hayne MSS. on 3-17-60.

Two pictures in this collection were trans-
ferred to the Picture File, in this Dept., on
Bo21-60,

 

5 items transferred from the Robert Bridges
MSS. (discontinued), 11-9-61. These five let-
ters of 1879-1914 from Robert Bridges, poet lau-
reate of England, to Edmund Gosse relate to lit-
erary matters, On Apr. 30, 1883, and Feb. 18,

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William, 80

 

22, 1893, Bridges discusses publishing various
works. The letter of Nov. 11, 1879, iS a criti-
cism of a manuscript of poetry, but apparently
not one by either Goss or Bridges. The fifth
item is a letter of introduction (March 16,
1914).

34 items (the George Moore MSS.) transferred,
11-13-61. These letters (ca, 1888-1921, and n.
d.) of George Augustus Moore (1852-1933), poet,
are one side of a correspondence with Sir Edmund
Gosse about various authors and literary works,

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William, 81

 

It involves their own writings primarily, especi-
ally those of Moore, but it includes random opin
ions on many others as well. Writing is not
easy for Moore. He labors with early drafts and
puts much effort into revisions. His problems
with composition are a common topic with Gosse
from whom he often seeks advice. Non-literary
matters seldom enter these discussions, There
are twenty-three original letters and eleven
typewritten copies. The source of the type-
written copies is no longer known,

The following works of Gosse are mentioned or

recatalogued). These letters by Henry James
(1843-1916), novelist, are filled with remarks
and opinions about various authors and their
works, James is writing to Edmund Gosse, a
friend for many years, and he discusses literar
and personal matters freely, sometimes extensive
ly. He comments upon many of his own books,
articles, and plays, and also upon those by
Gosse and other writers. The correspondence in
this addition is scattered from 1885 to 1915.
Indices of authors and works with dates of the
letters in which they are mentioned are given

Gosse, Sir Edmund William, 88

 

Gosse (thirteen are typed copies only), a copy
of one from James to Mrs. Gosse (original in

Johnston Forbes-Robertson to Gosse, Forbes-
Robertson was an actor and the producer of "The
High Bird," a play by James that he comments
about on Feb. 22, 1909. This correspondence was

catalogued on Sept. 3, 1935, as the Henry James
Papers. The typed copies should be used with
caution. Photostats of the letters from James
to Gosse are filed with the other copies.

An excellent bibliography of

James (New York, 1920), 2 vols. Five letters
in this collection are printed in these Letters,
and they are so identified on the autograph
cards. For other letters from James to Gosse

6 items added, 5-3-62 (Henrik Ibsen Papers,
recatalogued).

These six autograph letters: (1872-1891) to
Gosse are from Henrik Ibsen, Norwegian author,
whose works Gosse introduced to the English pu-
blic. Gosse acquired a reputation as a critic

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William, bad

 

of Scandinavian literature, All six items are
written in Norwegian, but the first three are
translated into English with explanatory notes
in John Nilsen Laurvik and Mary Morison,

of Henrik Ibsen (New York, 1908), pp. 230-232,
2u6- 248, 252-254 (Apr. 2, Oct. 14, 1872, and
Feb. 20, 1873). These three items concern Ib-
sen's response to Gosse's articles and reviews
of his works, Ibsen also mentions several of
his volumes. Translations were not found for
the later items (March 10, 1875; Nov. 29, 1890;

Feb. 8, 1891).

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William, 98

The Ibsen letters were catalogued on Sept.
11, 1935, as the Henrik Ibsen Papers.

3 items added, 7-24-73. Gosse's work on
poet Thomas Gray, especially the search for
the "MS. Lampoons," was the subject of a letter
of March 16, 1882, to William Barclay Squire.

On July 3, 1905, Gosse wrote to a reporter
by the name of Cook, possibly Sir Edward Tyas
Cook, sent him a copy of a speech, and thanked
him for helping the “unhappy authors of the
future,"

 

 
Gosse, Sir Edmund William. 99
On Dec. 18, 1915, Gosse rejoiced at evidence
of American support in the war.

Augustus Addison Gould (1803-1866), physician
conchologist, naturalist, and author, was the
son of Nathaniel Duren Gould, musician and con-
ductor, to whom he wrote a series of eight let-
ters, 1825-1827, He begins with his journey

 

south to Jericho, Maryland, where he became a
private tutor in the family of McBlair. New York
is described as inferior to Boston. Aftera
comment on Baltimore, young Gould describes the
Baltimore pike out to Jericho at the Little
Gunpowder falls. The McBlair family and their

 
Gould, Augustus Addison 2
business ventures are noted. Gould drew a pic-
ture of the McBlair house, factory, and surround
ing buildings for his father (Oct. 7, 1825). He
describes the Maryland woods and the social life
of the factory community. He tells of his
school, of church, and of visits to Baltimore
and Bel Air. Young Gould mentions his Harvard

 

classmates, Prentice, Livermore, Wilder, and
icknor. On April 16, 1826, he discusses his
Choice of a profession, inclining to law or
medicine. In an undated letter (probably July,
1826), he speaks of his growing fondness for the

of medicine. His friend, Dr. Gittings, encour-
ages this. References are made to the

The collection consists mainly of correspond-
ence from family members to Charles A. Gould,
who was originally from Lexington, Massachusetts
It covers the period from when Gould applied to

President Lincoln for the directorship of the
consulate at Prince Edward Island in March,
1861, through his service in the Civil War, and
the several civilian positions he held in
Kentucky after the war. By 1873 Gould had

 
Gould, Charles A. ae

 

settled down in Louisville, Kentucky, where his
name begins to appear in the city directories.
In 1878 he was listed as an employee of the
Louisville Steam Lithographing Co., and in 1880
he was listed as a cashier for that firm.

The collection is divided into six cate-

gories: correspondence, 1861-1889, and a few
undated letters, this category forming the bulk
of the collection; legal papers, 1871-1872,
including a court summons; financial papers,
1864-1873, consisting mostly of receipts from

 
Gould, Charles A. 3
various businesses; miscellany, 1864-1871, and

printed material, 1865-1870s, including a muster
roll of privates employed for extra duty, call-
ing cards, complimentary tickets to various
functions, business cards and a dance card;
printed material, including a theater and con-

 

cert program, a flyer from Fuller's Carpet
Beating Works, a tract encouraging reconcilia-
tion of the North and South printed after the
Civil War, information about Gould, Darling &
Co., a wholesale household goods business with

 
Gould, Charles A.
which Gould was associated and two pictures
probably of family members.

A few highlights of Charles Gould's career
follows. On Sept. 21, 1863, Corporal Charles
Gould was ordered to Nicholasville, Ky. with
an ambulance and was under the command of

 

General A. E. Burnside. There is one letter
from Burnside (Feb. 15, 1863) in the collection
to Charles thanking him for a photograph he had
sent to his wife. By Nov., 1863, he was captain
and assistant adjutant general at the head-

 
Gould, Charles A. Piha S
quarters of the Department of Ohio in Cincinnati
and by Feb. 22, 1866, Charles had been mustered
out of service. Before he was mustered out, he
was doing a considerable amount of soul search-
ing to try and seek a proper position for him-
self. By April, 1866, he had joined with George

 

A. Darling and Charles F. Smith to form the firm
of Gould, Darling & Co., wholesale dealers in
household furnishings. In Feb., 1867, he was
appointed deputy collector for the Fifth

 
Gould, Charles A.

Internal Revenue District of Kentucky to inspect
the distilleries in the district. He later
became a broker in tobacco and spirits in Louis-
ville. In March, 1873, Charles apparently was
checking into the carpet and rug cleaning in-
dustry. It is uncertain whether or not he

 

actually did go into this business. In July,
1873, Charles wrote from Bowling Green, Ky., on
letterhead stationery of the Security Insurance.
Company of Kentucky. In two letters, March 18,
1870, and Sept. 7, 1871, Sarah, Charles's

 
Gould, Charles A.

 

Sister, on behalf of Charles writes that she
has gone to Mrs. Perkins, apparently a fortune
teller, to ask her advice about his future. In
the letter of 1870, she advises him to go into
the insurance business. In the 1871 letter,
she suggests that he remain in the brokerage

liquor business. The fortune teller admonished
him against changing his business so often and
advised that people who made their fortunes fast
also lost their fortunes in a hurry.

The collection gives a particularly good view
of family relationships, sibling, husband and

 
Gould, Charles A,

 

wife, and parent and child. Charles had two
brothers and six sisters who wrote to him.
Their concern for each other's health and wel-
fare is routinely reflected. Scattered refer-
ences are made to the relationship between
Charles's father, James Gould, and his brother

Frank with other family members. His father
and brother Frank are routinely described as
risks to do business with because of their pro-
pensity to build castles in the air and their
costly business adventures. There are several

 
Gould, Charles A, ae

 

letters relating to some family property which
apparently Charles's mother had inherited.
Several letters contain sisterly advice, from
warnings about smoking which Nellie says leads
to drinking (April 28, 1866), and Sarah who
offers advice about marriage (Sept. 15, 1867).

Later Sarah writes on behalf of her mother
offering do's and dont's about how to take care
of Charles's infant son (March 18, 1870).
References to the Civil War are sketchy.
There are a couple relating to fund raising

 
Gould, Charles A. 10
activities in Massachusetts for the U. S.
Sanitary Commission. On April 21, 1864, one of
Charles's friends wrote him from the U. S. Army
Ninth Army Corps Headquarters in Annapolis, Md.
He had replaced Charles on the staff. In the
letter (Apr. 21, 1864) he explained what some

 

of his duties were. There are several letters
describing the civilian reaction to the end of
the war and to Lincoln's death. Ina letter,
Dec. 16, 1867, Frank described his activities

in Florida during the war. For some time he was

 
Gould, Charles A. LE
a contract surgeon and volunteer in the federal
outpost at Cedar Keys. The problems encountered
during the postwar reconstruction period are
described in areas of Texas, Georgia and Ken-
tucky in letters dated March 31 and Oct. 29,
1866, and Sept. 17, 1867.

 

Because so many letters are written from
Lexington, Mass., one is able to get an idea
of several different aspects of life in the
area. For example reading to family members,
attending a singing school and having tintypes

 
Gould, Charles A, 12

 

taken figured prominently among the amusements.
In other letters dated June 18, and Dec. 4,
1866, household chores and wages paid to do-
mestic help employed in the Gould household
are described. Various holidays and celebra-
tions are also described.

*There are several letters to Charles from
his sister Katie, who lived with her husband
and children in Charlottetown, Prince Edward
Island. Different aspects of life there are
commented upon, including social and economic

 
Gould, Charles A. iS
conditions and how the Civil War in the United
States was affecting people in Charlottetown.
Letters indicate her husband was a successful
businessman, but it is not stated whether or
not he is Canadian.

Disease, sickness and death figure prominent-

 

ly in several letters. Two of Charles's

sisters die, one of them from tuberculoses. In
a letter, Feb. 21, 1864, Carrie wrote she had
visited Mrs. Sessions on his behalf and reported
that in a trance she had prescribed a remedy

 
Gould, Charles A. 14

 

for a sore throat. A later visit is made to a
doctor, who is described as a trance medium.
That visit is described in a letter, May 23,
1864. Other references are made to smallpox,
Jan. 16 and 19, 1873, to cholera July 27, 1873
and to a disease attacking horses, Dec. 1. 1872.

sister Katie and her family is located in

The papers of John Mead Gould (1839-1930)
are those of the official historian of the lst-
10th-29th Maine Volunteers in the Union Army
during the Civil War. They contain letters,
diaries, official papers, and pictures. Gould
devoted his life to a detailed chronicle of
this regiment, both in the field and as a
veterans' association officer after the fighting
References to Portland, Maine, and to Edward
Sylvester Morse, Gould's lifelong friend, occur
in the manuscripts. Unfortunately, the
detailed accounts of eS the Civil

Gould, John Mead 2

War fighting, sent home in journal form to be
bound, are not with the collection. These
missing volumes of letters were the basis of the
History of the lst-1l0th-29th Maine Regiment
published in 1871. Filed at the beginning of
the papers is a brief chronology Gould kept
while in the army.

 

 

The early letters concern Edward Gould,
father of John Mead Gould. He was cashier of
the Manufacturer's and Trader's Bank of Portland
A member of the Natural History Society of Port

Gould was sent to Gould Academy at Bethel,
Maine, where he was a schoolmate of Edward
Sylvester Morse (1838-1925), a Maine boy who
became a distinghished American zoologist. Both
boys were interested in shells. For many years
references and correspondence pertain to Morse.
A draftsman at the Portland locomotive works

 

during the Civil War, he began to make drawings
of Melania for George Washington Tryon. (These
were published by the Smithsonian Institution
in 1866 in a monograph on mollusks.) Morse

the 1860's gives “@ Morse's early career

William E. Harward, a friend who went to New
York, describes the 7th New York Militia, a

lst Maine Volunteers

 

On April 23, 1861, John Mead Gould enlisted
as a private in Co. C, lst Maine Volunteers,
presumably for three months, although the
Governor of Maine insisted the term of service
was two years. The first group of 1861 letters
come from Washington, @ where the lst Maine

 
Gould, John Mead 5
joins the confusion around the Capital involvirg
Negroes, heat, health, and food.

 

lLOth ‘Maine Volunteers

 

Ordered back to Maine in July, the men were
not pressed to continue service for two years,

but many of them entered the 10th Maine in
which Gould became a 2nd lieutenant in Co. E.
He served as adjutant from March 29, 1862, unti
May 8, 1863, when the 10th was mustered out.
Gould stated that this regiment had "in its
ranks the greatest “é of good soldiers and

 
Gould, Jonn Mead 6
the fewest of poor ones of all-the Maine regi-
ments."

Most of the details of the 10th and its
successor, the 29th, are ably recorded in
Gould's History of the lst-lOth-29th Maine
Regiment, so that this sketch will not contain
what he so ably narrated in 1871.

 

 

The Railroad Brigade

 

During the winter of 1861-1862 the regiment
with the lst Michigan and 60th New York formed
the brigade guarding oe ™ and Ohio

 
vould, Jonn Mead 7
Railroad at Relay, Maryland. Gould's letters
(they are illustrated) portray life in the"Rail
way Brigade". The guard duty was regarded as a
vast responsibility because of the vital need ta
keep the line open for supplies for McClellan's
army around Washington. Evidently Gould enjoyed
Baltimore, which he visited and described many

 

times. Colonel George Lafayette Beal was in
command of the 10th Maine in the brigade under
Colonel John Cleveland Robinson (1817-1897) and
later Colonel Dixon Stansbury Miles. The regi-
ment was sent to Harper's Ferry in Mar., 1862,
where Gould was “6 with the large number

 
Gould, John Mead fe)

of troops moving into Washington. The great
devastation at Harper's Ferry contrasted sharply
with the beautiful scenery. Families of officers
who came to live or to visit at Harper's Ferry
were a great annoyance.

 

Battle of Winchester

 

Finally in May, 1862, the 10th Maine moved
to Winchester, where it served under Lt. Col.
James S. Fillebrown, provost marshal of the
town. There the Union troops awaited the
return of the a ) army under General

 
Gould, John Mead 9
Thomas Janathan Jackson.

The first action in battle seen by the 10th
Maine came during the retreat of the army of
General Nathaniel Prentice Banks from Wincheste
when the regiment held in reserve fought as the
rear guard of the Union troops. Gould listed
casualties of the 10th Maine on May 29,"1862.
The regiment became part of the lst Brigade, lst
Division, under General Samuel Wylie Crawford.
While at Front Royal, Va., Gould wrote home a
description of Belle Boyd's activities. He also
kept a report made by a Union spy sent to
determine ee" Ce whereabouts in

 

 
Gould, John Mead
June, 1862.

 

The Battle of Cedar Mountain

 

In the summer the 10th Maine served under
General John Pope, suffering severe casualties
at the Battle of Cedar Mountain. At Rockville
on Sept. 8, 1862, Gould wrote of the decimated
lst Brigade and of various Union commanders:
Crawford, Pope, Banks, and McDowell.

The Battle of Antietam

 

 
Gould, John Mead 34

Two fragments of "field notes” survive from
the Maryland campaign. They are dated Aug. 12-
Sept. 2 and Sept. 7-28, 1862. Gould sent home
the list of casualties of the 10th Maine after
the Battle of Antietam. The letters of Nov. arm
Dec., 1862, describe a Sharp's carbine and list
guns he has collected. The fatal wounding of
General’ Joseph King Fenno Mansfield at Antietam
was witnessed by Gould, whose account of this
was forwarded to Mansfield's family in Middle-
town, Conn.

The Gould family had relatives in Bethel,
Maine, where the “~@o family lived. Here

 

 
Gould, John Mead Lz
also was the Gould Academy which John Mead Gou
attended. Adelbert B. Twitchell, Jr., was a
friend of these early years who continued to
correspond with Gould. Sometime in 1863,
Adelthia Twitchell, Adelbert's sister came to a
understanding, if not a betrothal, with John
Mead Gould. (Probably this event occured after

 

the 10th Maine was disbanded in May, 1863.) A
group of soldiers* letters to her in late 1862
are from members of the 17th New Hampshire
Regiment. Adelthia Twitchell inspired Gould
with a deep affection, so that when she decided
to marry another “se in 1865, Gould

 
Gould, John Mead i3
was greatly depressed. The Gould and Twitchell
families were deeply religious, as letters from
both groups demonstrate during and after the
ware

The 10th Maine in the lst Division of the XI]
Corps spent the winter of 1862-1863 near Fairfax
and Stafford Court Houses. It was mustered out

 

on May 8, 1863, at the end of two years" service
Meanwhile Colonel George Lafayette organized in
the fall of 1863 a new veteran regiment called

the 29th Maine.

 
Gould, John Mead 14
The 29th Maine

 

 

Beginning in Jan., 1864, the Gould family
wrote many letters about Portland events, family
gossip, army business, and finances. Evidently
John Mead Gould transmitted large amounts of
money from Union soldiers to his father at the

National Trader's Bank. These sums were then
paid to the families of the 29th Maine troops.
The regiment sailed on Feb. 2, 1864, for New
Orleans to join the 2nd Brigade, lst Division,
XIX Army Corps, for service in the Red River
Expedition of General oo Prentice Banks.

 
Gould, John Mead 15
During the campaign Colonel Beal took command
of the lst Brigade, with Gould as his adjutant,
Letters from the Red River begin Mar. 10, 1864,
with comment on the poor quality of both the
troops and the leaders. On April 26, Gould
wrote there was no Stonewall Jackson in Louisi-
ana. No clear picture is given in the letters

 

of the expedition, which was neither a Confed-
erate victory nor a Union success. Gould
remarked on the poor health of the Maine troops
exhausted by heat, exposure, marching, and bad
water. The U.S. Sanitary Commission sent new
clothing to New a i outfit the men.

 
Gould, John Mead 16

In late May, 1864, Howard Gould, John's
brother, and Del Twitchell, his friend, were in
Virginia in the Maine cavalry.

Gould's few letters from the Red River
Expedition gave opinions on such Union officers
as Andrew Jackson Smith, Nathaniel Prentice
Banks, and George Lafayette Beal. He remarked
on the inaccuracies of published reports of
this expedition, including the rumors of cotton
speculation (June 17, 1864).

(The 29th Maine sailed on the Clinton for
Fortress Monroe and then encamped near

Washington, D.C.) eS

 

 
Gould, John Mead 17

June and July, 1864, were spent in refitting
the lst Brigade. Gould found the XIX Corps a
“mixed-up" organization of scattered and diverse
units, By July 31, 1864, the XIX Corps and the
"disorganized" VI Corps were in the same
command,

Gould marched through Harper's Ferry with

 

the 29th Maine to join the command of General
Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley.
Discipline improved and the army filled up with
replacements.

On Sept. 8, 1864, word was received that
Adelthia Twitchell “So younger sister,

 
Gould, John Mead 18
Amelia Jenkins Twitchell, were coming South as
teachers under the auspcies of the American
Missionary Association.

 

The Battle of Opequon Creek

 

Meanwhile, on Sept. 18, 1864, the 29th Maine

fought in the battle at Opequon Creek. Gould
sent home the casualty list. No letters survive
describing the fight at Fisher's Hill, Sept. 22,
1864, but Gould wrate three letters on Oct. 21,
1864, about the Battle of Cedar Creek. Here
are opinions of =~ Philip Sheridan,

 
Gould, John Mead 19
William Dwight, and Edwin Page Davis. This was
one of the romantic events of the Civil War,
The 29th Maine had not been routed as had some
other regiments in the surprise Confederate
attack,

In Nov. Gould left brigade headquarters and
returned to the regiment. Here he was commis-

 

Sioned a major on Dec. 20, 1864, and spent the
winter at Stevenson's Depot, Va.

Adelthia -"Dellie"- Twitchell arrived at
Beaufort, S.C., on Nov. 8, 1864, with Amelia.
Her frequent letters describe freedmen, her
efforts to educate “eo” them, and the

 
Gould, John Mead ae 20
officers of the 32nd U.S. Colored Infantry
stationed at Hilton Head. Among these men was
Lt. Col. Benjamin W. Thompson, provost marshal
general of the Department of the Scuth. Much
‘religious opinion obscures the descriptions of
life among the freedmen, but religion does not
prevent the young Union officers from visiting
the Twitchell girls,

Gould was sent home in Feb., 1865, to
recruit, entered Island Hospital at Harper's
Ferry in April with bilious remittant fever,
and returned to the regiment in May, 1865. The

 

 
Gould, John Mead 2
29th sailed to Savannah, Ga., and finally
arrived at Darlington, S.C., in July, 1865, to
remain for a year. Letters for this period of
military occupation in South Carolina are not
voluminous, as Gould continued to send home his
journal. Correspondence with his father mentiors
business opportunities in the South. Cotton and
lumber speculation are concerns until the end o
1865. Gould begins to think of remaining in
South Carolina in business,

Deeply religious and concerned with the life
of the Negroes, he expressed hope that his work
as assistant provost ra at Darlington,

 

 
Gould, John Mead Ze

 

S.C., would aid the black people. Gould's
depression at this time was deepened by the
approaching marriage of Adelthia Twitchell to
Colonel Thompson. The Twitchell sisters
returned to Bethel, Maine, to prepare for the
wedding on Sept. 14, 1865. Col. and Mrs.
Thompson went to Williamsport, Pa., where the
Colonel was to supervise the lumber operations
of Dodge and Sons of New York. Letters from
Williamsport begin at this time.

Amelia Twitchell returned to her missionary
work in South Carolina in Nov., 1865. Corres-
pondence with Gould eo and he actually

 
Gould, John Mead 23
paid her monthly salary of $20.00, as the
American Missionary Society did not support its
workers with stipends,

Early in 1866 Gould decided to leave the
army and enter business with Major Alpheus
Greene of the 29th Maine, John M. McCall, and
Edward C. Murray. Their store and lumbering
ventures at Yanhanna Ferry came to a disastrous
end, the description of which gives an excellen
picture of economic life in South Carolina
during reconstriction,

Early in the summer of 1866 Gould met Amelia

 

 
Gould, John Mead 24
Twitchell and fell in love with her. She
returned to Maine. Gould's letters to her
alternate among love, religion, business dif-
ficulties, and illness. He returned to Portland
and married Amelia on Nov. 13, 1866. Alpheus
Greene's reports to Gould indicate the serious
difficulties in which their business was

 

involved. Amelia, Gould, and Greene's family
came back to Yanhanna Ferry in the midst of a
bitterly cold January in 1867.

Economic conditions were desperately hard;
politics, as bad. Gould wrote on April 22,
1867, that on whites r concerned about

 
Gould, John Mead 25
Negro suffrage; the blacks had scarcely heard
of it. Gould and Greene sent their wives home
by ship in May, 1867. They drove their horses
and carryall north to Williamsport, Pa., in
June, abandoning what was left of their
business, Malaria, floods, and a destitute
country had defeated them.

 

Gould worked for C.P,. Kimball and Co.,
carriage makers in Portland, Maine, before he
returned to his old position in the National
Traders' Bank in 1873. He settled his private
financial affairs as best he could, going bank-
rupt in 1869, “gers was in financia

 
Gould, John Mead 26
difficulty for a number of years, remaining in
Williamsport, Pa., before finally returning to
Providence, R.I., in 1872.

For the remainder of his long life, John
Mead Gould served as historian for the lst-10th
29th Maine Regiment. Correspondence for the
publication of the official history begins in
1867. He wrote to ask various veterans for
information, and their answers together with a
few maps of battles helped Gould compile his
excellent history. Almost immediately after the
Civil War the veteran survivors began reunions,

In 1870, Edward Sylvester Morse wrote a num-
ber of letters to Gould in regard to the publi-
cation of maps in the regimental history. Morse
was at Peabody Institute in Salem, Mass.

 

 

 

 

 

 
Gould, John Mead 30
Many veterans helped Gould by buying the
history or by selling it in various New England

towns. Although not affluent in the 1870's,
Gould began to collect books about the Civil
War and to seek government publications from
Maine and the United States. On Jan. 4, 1875,
he remarked that he was in debt for the cost of

 

publishing the history.

Economic depression marked the 1870's,
BuSiness disasters are noted; for example, C.P.
Kimball, the carriage maker, failed and moved
his factory to Chicago. Veterans wrote to Gould
to establish pension eo

 
Gould, John Mead ah

On June 1, 1874, Professor John Smith Sewall
of Bowdoin College described a student rebellion

Gould continued membership in the Portland
Natural History Society, Edward S. Morse was
becoming "a big gun," although few details now
appear concerning his career. Morse sent Gould
a picture in 1878.

 

The Gould family and relatives went camping
on the Maine coast in the summer; some friends
came from out of state. At this period Gould
was interested in family genealogy.

The years from 1880 until 1929 are filled
with all sorts of “~@ activities: reunions

 
Gould, John Mead 32
were held; regimental directories were compiled
excursions were made to battlefields in Maryland
and Va.; pensions were secured for veterans;
monuments erected; and a Civil War library was
gathered,

Govld gublished a regimental directory in
1889, as well as corrections for his history
and a narrative of the mortal wounding of
General Joseph K.F. Mansfield (1895).

The deeply religious character of the Gould
family inspired the eldest daughter, Annie
Allender Gould, to go to China as a missionary.

 

 
Gould, John Mead
There she was killed in the Boxer Rebellion
about July 1, 1900.

Correspondence with General Joshua Lawrence
Chamberlain and Congressman Thomas Brackett
Reed came in the 1900's,

Gould's son, Oliver Cromwell Gould, and his
niece, Alice E. (Gould) Breene, assisted in
veteran activities in Gould's last years,
Reunions continued until 1943, when the lst-
1Oth-29th Maine Regimental Association was
disbanded,

Legal papers of this collection contain per-
sonal commissions; “oOo discharges;

 

 
Gould, John Mead 34
furloughs; and pensions; papers from the super.
ior provost court at Darlington, S.C., 1865-
1866; and personal legal papers.

Rolls and reports of the lst-1l0Oth-29th Maine,
1861-1869, form the official papers of the
regiment concerning supplies, finances, fur-
loughs, etc,

 

Financial papers center around arrangements
to pay soldiers' families in Maine,

Reunion papers, 1869-1933, cover sixty-five
consecutive regimental reunions with lists of
veterans, minutes of meetings, obituaries, etc.

career of a Louisiana freedman, Harry Johnson,
who followed the regiment home to Maine, is
related in the white-covered volume marked
"Jennings", These notebooks are the basis of
the directory published by Gould in 1889.

The letters by Gould during the war, called
his journal, were bound into several volumes
by his family. Although these are not with his
papers, a long series of memorandum diaries by
Gould remains in the collection. These little
volumes begin in “"@ at Bethel Academy and

 

 
Gould, John Mead 37
continue until 1874, when Adelthia (Twitchell)
Thompson and William E, Harward died. It is
probable that this is the date William Edward

His family moved to North Conway, N.H.

Robert N. and Henry Gourdin were prominent
citizena of Charleston, S.C.. Coming from a
Planting family of modest means, they began mer-
cantile and commission business in Charleston
about 1840, and had a considerable part in the
promotion of railroad building in the state.
Sometime later they formed a partnership with

Frederic C. Matthiesson under the fir
Gourdin, Matthiesson and Company. this =

 
GOURDIN, Robert N. Sketch (2)
continued until 1858 when Louis Gourdin Young,
a nephew was taken into the partnership. He
was the son of Thomas G. Young and Gourdin's
sister who signs herself only as "R. Young" #
At this time the firm was valued at $162,470.00
In 1860 R.N. Gourdin's real estate was valued
at $10,900, and he owned eight slaves. Henry
Gourdin's real estate totaled $12,000 and two
slaves.

The firm dealt in rice, sea island cotton,

and wines. During the Civil War they sold much
of théir wine stock, shipping it to points in-

land. After the warp they worked to restore
their trade and Robert N. Gourdin made several
trips to Liverpool in the interests of the bus-
iness. They were hard hit by the panic of 1873.
Louis Gourdin Young served in the Confederate
army and participated in the fighting around
Petersburg in 1864. During this period his

 

mother stayed in Cheraw, S8.C., from which she
wrote several letters to her brother, R.N.Gourdi
who remained in Charleston. The war letters
reflect the difficulties in transportation ani
the general confusion of the times. There is

 
GOURDIN, Robert N. Sketch (4)
some mention of the siege of Charleston. In
1861 runaway slaves on the sea islands and the
situation at Sumter are subjects of comment.
Immediately after the war there was hope of
a quick return to normal life and business.
There is comment on the need for speedy repair
Of railroads. The bad condition of St. Michaels

 

St. Phillip's and othefS Charleston churches is
a subject several times referred to, together
with the feeling that the congregations: will

never again attend servicea at then.

 
GOURDIN. Robert. N. Sketch (5)

Henry Gourdin was a close friend of John CG.
Calhoun. Upon Calhoun's death in April, 1850,
Alfred Huger was sent to Washington to bring
the body back to Charleston, His two letters
written from there contain much interesting
comment on partisian matters and the Benton-
Foote feud.

ness establishment of consitiierable importance

are letters written in Aug. 1844 to Robert N.
Gourdin from his friend Thomas J. Young, who
had journeyed to Boston. He dwells at length
on national politics, stating that he felt Clay
would defeat Polk, that the majority of the
people were for protection, and that he differed

with some of the opinions of Rhett and Calhoun.
In the summer and fall of 1853 Henry Gourdin was
in Europe, and in his letters he mentioned rail-
road construction in North and South Carolina,

the Dunowant-Legaré duel, and the state of the

uropean market fOr sea island cotton. in Oct.
1856 H. E, Young wrote from Charleston to Robert
N, Gourdin in Manchester, Eng., telling of the
duel between Ed. Magrath and W, R. Taber, Jr.
and the recent campaign in which Wm. Porcher
Miles was elected to Congress, There are quite
a few letters from Robert's sister, Mrs. A. R.

 

Young, who during at least part of the Civil War
lived in Cheraw, 8.C, She wrote from there on
Apr. 23, 1864 about the work in both that town
and Florence that was being done by the Female
Association for the Relief of the Soldiers.

 
Gourdin, Robert N. Sketch (8)

_Upon his election to the 5. CG. convention
that was assembled late in 1860 to consider the
matter of secession Robert Gourdin received
several letters urging that 8. C. take that

fatal step. After the convention had voted for
secession, John W. Ellis of N. C, wrote to

 

Robert, praising 8. C. for what she had done,
attacking Andrew Johnson as a demagogue and a
traitor, and saying that Jacob Thompson, Sec. of
the Interior, was loyal to the South. There is
a copy of a letter written from Charleston by
Alfred Huger on Feb. 14, 1861, speculating on
the steps Lincoln and & Major Anderson might

 
Gourdin, Robert N. 9

 

take in regard to Sumter and criticizing Gen.
Scott.

In 1862 Henry Edward Young was serving with
Longstreet's Corp in Va. He wrote his Uncle
Robert an evaluation of various officers, in-
cluding Beauregard, Bragg, Joseph E. Johnston,
Lee, and "Stonewall" Jackson. In Dec., 1863, he
was in Charleston and from there he wrote about
the shelling of the city proper, Fort Sumter,
and other fortifications.

Some letters mention the price of sugar in
S.C. during the Civil War and the wine trade of
the Gourdin brothers. = A copy of a deed of

Sale shows that in May 1664 a mulatto woman and
her fowchildren were sold tdthem and Henry E,
Young for $1000.

A soldier's letter of June 10, 1864 describes
the battle of Fort Darling on Drewry's Bluff,Va.
and comments on the renomination of Lincoln.
After the removal of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston as

commander of the Army and Dept. of Tenn.,
Henry Gourdin wrote to Robert about it. Letters
from 5. C, in Jan of 1865 contain references to
Sherman's activities.

On Sept. 25, 1865 Wm. Porcher Miles wrote his
view on the situation ee in the South at that

of a pamphlet published in memory of Rev.Charles
Wallace Howard: who was pastor of the French

Protestant Church of Charleston from 1845 to
1852. Tipped in the back of this pamphlet is a
letter from Mrs. Harriott H. Ravenel to R. N.

Amsterdam. The second letter, written on
April 1, 1857, concerns his personal library,

Grabur Silk Mills, Inc. Papers, 1934-1948.
Burlington, Alamance County, North Carolina
Grabur Silk Mills, Inc., silk throwsters, was
incorporated in 1935 with a capital stock of
$300,000. One of its organizers was James Henry
McEwen (1894-1946) who became its president. He
was vice president, treasurer, and buyer for the
McEwen Knitting Company, manufacturers of Ladies

 

seamless and full-fashioned hosiery. An entry
of Aug. 31, 1935, in the Grabur Journal shows
that the ownership of its capital stock was
divided evenly between the McEwen Knitting Co.

 
Grabur Silk Mills, Inc. 2
and the May Hosiery Mills. The president of bot
McEwen and May in 1935 was William Henry May.
His brother, Benjamin Victor May, also became an
executive of Grabur Mills. In 1940 the May and
McEwen companies merged into May McEwen Kaiser,
one of the larger hosiery manufacturers in the
South. This firm was absorbed by Burlington

 

Industries in 1948. The Manuscript Department
has a collection from the archives of May

McEwen Kaiser.
Grabur Mills owned one-quarter of the stock

 
Grabur Silk Mills, Inc. _ 3
of Scott Hosiery Mills, Inc., of Graham, N.C.,
manufacturers of ladies’ full-fashioned silk
hosiery. Grabur was a party to the dissolution
of Scott Hosiery in 1945, and its copy of the
liquidation agreement is filed with the Scott
Hosiery Papers. The dissolution transactions
are detailed in the entries of Jan. 31, Feb. l,

 

1945, in the checkbook and journal of Sidney
Knitting Mills. Sidney purchased Grabur's one-
quarter interest in Scott Hosiery.

Grabur Mills appears in the annual volumes

 
Grabur Silk Mills, Inc. 4
of Davison's Textile Blue Book. A biographical
sketch of J.H. McEwen appears in Who Was Who in
America, 1943-1950, and he and W.H. May are in
Archibald Henderson, North Carolina, The Old
North State and the New... (chicago, 1941), IV,

The collection consists of financial state-

 

 

 

 

 

 

ments, account books, and miscellaneous reports.
The major financial statements are complete for
1935-1948 except for one year. The ledgers,
journals, cashbooks, trial balances, and sales

 
Grabur Silk Mills, Inc. nih 5
journals cover 1935-1945. There are less exten-
sive series of other accounts from purchasing,

Grace, John Patrick. Papers, 1902-1940. Char-
Leston, Charleston Co., 5.C, 12,077 items &
3 vols, Restricted,

John P, Grace was born on "factory mili®
in Charleston, 8.°,, in 1874. He attended the
Christian Brothers! School, nat lecker High
School, and received his law degree in 1902
from Georgetown, In the course of his law care

 

he was associsted with the firm of Logan and
Grace and Logan, Grace, and Cosgrove. He found-
ed and edited the Charleston American daily
newspaper and was elected mayor of Charleston

for two terms; a 1919-1923. Until his

 

 
J P 2
death on June 25, 1940, he was influential
politically in Charleston as well as in state
oe eschate ga circles. “e was a member of the

ibernian Society, the German Rifle Club, the
Elks Club, the “nights of Columbus, and of
several organizations dedicated to "Irish lib-

 

erty. He also was the attorney for the Central
Labor Union of Charleston,

The Grace papers are divided into two sets
because the first set is on deposit and the
second set was purchased, Within each set an
arbitrary division has been made, separating

 
 

TOT a i
legal papers (those connected with Grace's law

practice/ from all others.

The papers for the early years (1911-1920)
are, in the main, concerned with Charleston
politics. Ag in many other cities throughout
the country, Charleston politics was corrupt

and the elections were often occasions for

violence and intimidation, This generalization
is apparent in the Grace papers connected with
the mayoralty election of 1915, the election of
the U.S. representative from South Carolina in
1916, and the el of 1919. Grace

 
a 4
was a candidate for mayor in 1911, 1915, and
1919. He appears to have been considered an
upstart in Charleston politics; at least he
Claimed to be opposed to the rule of the re-
actionary aristocrats who, he thought, had
contrelled Charleston, Since Grace wes Roman
Catholic, religious prejudice was often inject-

 

ed into elections campaigns in which he was
active, This apparently was true especially for
the election of 1919.

The corruption of Charleston elections was
also demonstrated by several governors when

 
J Patrick 5
they called out the militia to keep the péace
in Charleston during te elections (for example,
1919), by the murder of a Grace man in 1915,
and Grace's charge that Francis Marion Whaley
bSought his seat in the House of Representatives
in the election of 1916.

In connection with his charge against

 

eel ar Grace asked Ben Tillman, senator from
a

South Carolina, to aid in unseating Whaley.

After several exchanges of letters, Grace con-

Cluded that Tillman would not help, so he,
Grace, petitioned the House to hold an inves-

 
 

John Patrick 6
tigation of the election of Whaley, presenting
affidavits to show that Whaley had spent an
enormous sum of money ($60,000 ) to buy votes.
The House committee, which received the
petition, gave him a hearing but decided a-
gainst an investigation, claiming a lack of

evidence to support the charge of corruption.
Grace maintained that Whaley influenced the
committee. It is noteworthy that in the course
of the hearing Grace admitted that he had
spent $15,000. when he was elected mayor and
that seme of the money was used to buy Votes.

 
 

Grace, Jgai Eo nici - Z
n 1916, Grace began publishing the

Charleston American, a daily morning paper.
From the many letters concerning the founding
and progress of the paper, the problems and
great expense connected with the publication
of a daily paper becOme apparent. Also, there
are comparisons of the progress of the Charles

 

ton American with the established News and
Courier. Grace waseditor of the paper and
his editorials got him into trouble,

When he began publishing the paper, the
war in Europe was nearly two years old. Grace,

 
Grace, John Patrick 8

 

who was a dedicated advocate of 4rish liberty,
possessed a temperament admirably suited to
Opposing British policy. Editorially, he
accused England of starting the war in order to
preserve her naval and commercial superiority
which Germany was challenging. He also pointed
out that United Ststes citizens, by extending
loans to the allies, had a financial stake in
a vietory over the Central Powers, and that
the United States was being flooded with Britis
propaganda. Grace was very critical of British
naval policy with respect to United States

 
P a
shipping, and he viewed the high handed action
as a more flagrant violation of neutrality
than German submarine attacks.

Grace wanted the United States to observe
strict neutrality, as Wilson had proposed.
Since Wilson's policy of neutrality was a farc
Grace was most critical of Wilson when the
United States entered the war. Grace called it
"Wilson's War." His editorials were so critical
of Wilson and so pro-German that Grace, on the
basis of the espionage act, was cited to appear
for a hearing, and the Charleston American lost

 

 
Grace, John Patrick __10
its third class mailing privilege. This was
apparently a bad decision and one inspired by
Grace's enemies, for the mailing privilege
was restored and a financial adjustment made.
Although Grace did not hold office after
1923, he was active in politics until his death
Earlier he had been a supporter of Cole Blease
and an admirer of Tillman, who was very fond
of Grace's wife but who had little im common
with Grace, Gusce corresponded with Governors
Thomas Gordan Mc*eod (1923-27), John Gardiner

 

Richards (1927-31), Ihra C. Blackwood (1931-

 
 

ease. Tope Latrigk. i)
35), and Olin D, Johnston (1935-39). Of these

men, Grace appeared closest to Richards, asking
and receiving many favors. To Grace, Blackwood
was an object of contempt. During the campaign
for governor, Grace claimed that he reached
an agreement with Blackwood. The terms were
that Grace should support Blackwood in Sharles-

ton in return for the privilege of being con-
sulted concerning appointments made in Charles-
ton. After the elction, Grace wrote that his
enemies got to Blackwood and Grace was not
given any consideration. In fact Blackwood re-

 
 

moved him from the highway commission. Grace
denounced Blackwood, and his letter of denun-
ciation permits the reader an intimate view of
Charleston politics. Blackwood, of course,
denied the charges and scoffed at Grace's in-
fluence in Charleston, reminding him that he
had lost his contest for alderman in 1931.

Throughout the twenties and thirties, he
also corresponded with a number of politicians
on the national level. In 1922, he received a
letter from his friend and Representaive from
South Carolina, W. Turner Logan, who spoke of

 
Grace, John Patrick 13
joining the "Bolsheviks, Borah, LaFollette and
Frasier," and explained that this alignment was
not a third party movement but "simply progress
ive." Grace also exchanged letters with Mill-
ard E. Tydings, James F. Byrnes, Hamilton Fish,
Jr., James A. Reed, Pat McCarran, George W.
Norris, James E. Murray , Eugene Talmadge, Elli-
son D. "Smith, and Wm, W. Ball.

Grace was "active in the presidential elect-
ion of 1928, and was invited by Tydings to make
a series of addresses in behalf of the Demo-
cratic candidate, Alfred E. Smith. In the

 

 

 
eg t
course of this election, some of Grace's letter
reveal his political philosophy, and this was
elaborated in his letters during the '30's. In
connection with the presidential election of
1932, Grace was sorely disappointed when Frank-
lin *. Roosevelt won the Democratic nomination
instead of Al Smith. Grace accused Roosevelt of

 

being an ingrate and an opportunist, and Grace
remained a severe critic of Roosevelt, espec-
lally concerning Roosevelt's treatment of the
Supreme Court, Also, Grace's antipathy toward
Roosevelt was one reason why Grace became crit-

 
P 15
ical of Byrnes,who, Grace Glaimed, shifted
from Smith to Roosevelt in 1931.

Of interest in the twenties, also, are
Grace's speculation in Florida real estate, hig
losses growing out of the depression, and his
Opinion (1934) asthe causes of the depression.

 

During the thirties, Grace wrote at length
on world politics. The letters are particularl
good for discerning his political philosophy,
his reasoning with respect to the entrance of
the United States into World War I, and his
opinion ashthe developments in Europe that led

 
Grace, John Patrick 16

to World War II, While he disapproved of some
of Hitler's tactics, Grace believed,or so he
wrote, that Hitler was one of the greatest men
of the day (1938). Important also is the long
letter from George Norris showing why he had
woted against the entrance of the United States

 

into World War I.

Under the heading of legal papers are
those documents connected with the business of
the Charleston American, the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge Co., the Cooper River Bridge Co., the
Whaley hearing, and the 0.B. Limehouse Case,

The Robert S. Gracey Papers are from States-
ville, N.C., and Mt. Meigs, Ala. They concern
the Gracey family living in Iredell County, N.C.
Robert S. Gracey had a number of brothers: Mer

cer W., Macon, Marengo Co., Ala.; John S.,
Columbia, S.C.; and James B. Gracey of "Oak
Forest," Iredell County, N.C. His father and
brother Bill were living in 1841 in N.C.

The papers concern business affairs and

 
Gracey, Robert S.

 

the settlement of the estate of Robert S.
Gracey by his brother Mercer. They mention
sales and prices of slaves, as well as a list
of slaves at a time when Alabama was open as
an active market in the slave trade. Isaac
Jarratt of Huntsville, N.C., writes a business

letter to Gracey. Jarratt was an active slave
trader at this time. See the Jarratt-Puryear
MSS. in this department.

Jean Gracey, the great-grandmother of James
K. Polk, was an Irish Presbyterian who married

Gracie, William Benjamin 2

 

His four-page letter of March 14, 1916, was
written at Camp Eagle Pass, Texas. He discusseg
the weather and living conditions of the area,
making brief comparisions to tours of duty in
the Philippines and Boston. Fears of attacks
by Francisco "Pancho" Villa and the doubtful

loyalty of Mexicans living in the area, as well
as the possibility of U.S. forces having gone
across the Mexican border, are mentioned, This
letter was dated the day before Pershing went
into Mexico after Villa.

The Graham family,of Scotch-Irish descent,
was one of the most prominent Presbyterian fami
lies in Va. Some of its members settled in Va.
as early as 1776. They moved from Penna.into the
vicinity of Lexington,Va.,associating and inter
marrying with such well known Presbyterian fami
lies as the Lyles, Caruthers,McClungs,McClures,
McDowells,and Alexanders. The MSS. cover three

Pepepetions in general:
1) Rev.William Graham,his brother, Edward, and

 

wife, Margaret or Graham.

 
Graham, William 2
(2) William A., Archibald, Nancy, Elizabeth,
and Edward, Jr.
(3) Dr. John Graham and Beverly Tucker Lacy.
Reverend William Graham was born in Paxton
township, Pa., Dec. 19, 1746. He was the son of
Michael Graham and Susanna (Miller) Graham. He
was educated at Princeton, then Nassau Hall,

 

graduating in 1773. In 1776 he married Mary Kerr
of Carlisle, Pa., bought a farm near Lexington,
and moved there to preach and supplement his
salary by farming. He soon began Liberty Hall
Academy which grew into Washington College and
eventually into me and Lee University.

 
Graham, William ___ Sketch, (3)

For twenty years he continued as rector until
1796,when he resigned on account of having ex-
pressed himself too freely on political ques-
tions. Then he bought 6,000 acres of land on the
Ohio river near Marietta,where he intended to
found a settlement of pious people. By failing
to examine the land before purchase he was

 

cheated,became involved in a lawsuit,and while
investigating the charges,he died on June 8,
1799, in Richmond, Va.

He left six children: two sons and four
daughters: Jahab Graham, William P., one daugh-
ter who died quite or three others, two

 
Graham, William se Sketch (4)
of whom were named Mary and Rebecca. Jahab was a
graduate of Liberty Hall Academy,and later be-
came a member of the faculty. He soon entered
the ministry,however. There were no children of
his marriage with a Miss Heiskell. William Gra-
ham married a Miss Nash of N.C. and settled in
Ga. One daughter married a Murdoch and lived in
Penna. The other daughters married minister; a
Mr.Bracken of Penna.,and David Rice of Kentucky.
Rev.William Graham had two brothers in Va.,
Michael and Edward. Michael married Elizabeth
Lyle and their most distinguished child was the
Rev.Samuel Lyle =“ Edward Graham began

 

 

 
Graham, William ; Sketch, (5)
life as a lawyer,but in 1813 he became professo
of natural science and astronomy in Washington
College,where he remained until about 1834.
Shortly before that time there had been a gener
al house cleaning in the College,and Graham was
dismissed,presumably because he was unpopular
with the students.

 

Edward Graham's wife,Margaret (Alexander)
Graham,was the sister of Dr.Archibald Alexander
who taught at Hampden-Sidmey and later at Prince
ton. They had eight children who reached matu-
rity. Sally,who married Rev.William Lacy,had
lived in Prince EdwardGo.,and later moved to

Tennessee, Dr.William A.Graham, unmarried; Nancy
R.Graham,also unmarried; Dr.Archibald A.Graham,
who married his cousin,Martha Lyle; Margaret,
who died at sixteen; Elizabeth,who was unmarried
Edward,who died at 22; and Martha who married
Wm.M.Tate. Martha left one daughter,Mary Tate,
who married her cousin,Dr.John Graham of Lexing
Margaret (Alexander) Graham (b.June,1770)

was ewtidently a very able woman whose voluminous
correspondence,chiefly with her children,did
much to hold the fatily together.

William A.Graham had a checkered career. He
studied at Princeton eo Carolina College,

 

 

 
Greham, William : Sketch, (7)

 

taught in the Abingdon (Va.) Academy,and prac-
ticed medicine and law. He was also an tihventor
of note,having devised a still in much demand,a
saw,and a fire extinguisher,the patent for which
Was not obtained until after his death. The
patent was difficult to get on account of anoth
er inventor's influence in Congress. William A.
Graham was also a merchant and invested heavily
in mining operations in N.C. He spent the great
est part of his adult life in N.C.,living much
of the time in Oxford and McDowell County.
Edward,his brother,taught for several years in

 
Graham, Willi ___ Sketch. (8)

 

Washington,N.C.,and spent much time in Oxford,
N.C. Archibald,the third brother,studied medi-
cine,lived in Lexington,was postmaster,and in
1867 was a member of the Va.House of Delegates.
He owned land in Minnesota, travel@i in Europe,
corresponded with John Letched, and seems to
have been important in state politics.

In the third generation Rev.Beverly Tucker
Lacy Was an outstanding figure. He studied at
Princeton,and later preached in Va.and N.C. Dr.
John Graham,son of Dr.Archibald Graham,was also
and important member of the third generation.

Of the Graham oes of

The most of Rev.William Graham's correspondence
has reference to his Ohio land deal. Much of the
correspondence of Edward and his family is per-
sonal, though Edward himself corresponded with
Edmund Ruffin and carried on considerable scien
tific experimentation. A great number of the
papers relate to a patent for William A.'s fire
extinguisher, The family was influential in the
Presbyterian Church and in education,contribut-
ing many physicians, en teachers

UIDEAn addition (7-20-44) of 43 pieces con-
Sists of the letters of Graham's son, William
A. Graham, Jr. The earliest of these (Feb.3,
1859) 1s written from Princeton where Graham
was a student, and mentions studies, expenses,
and his preference for the University of North
Carolina because 6f its Southern student body.

Letters for the war years, supplemented
by War of the Rebellion ... Records indicate
that Graham was lieutenant of the Second

Squadron, Second North Carolina Cavalry, which

 

 

 
Graham, William Alexander -4-

 

is alternately referred to as "Co.K, 19th
North Carolina Volunteers." The commanding
officer was Col. S. B. Spruill. In 1861 and
1862, Graham was on the Eastern coast of
North Carolina, and besides giving details

of choosing camp sites and of skirmishes with

the enemy, he describes the countryside with
particular attention to agricultural methods.
His description of Pembroke and account of
the Cabarrus family, the former owners, are

especially interesting (see letter, Nov.7,

1861).

 
Graham, William Alexander =5-

 

In 1863, Graham had attained the rank of
Captain and he and his cavalry company were
transferred to Virginia under the command of
Gen. Longstreet. He operated chiefly in the
Norfolk area, but on May 8, 1863, he was order-
ed to rejoin his regiment, Stuart's dividim,

Army of Northern Virginia. Except for one
letter (Apr. 24, 1863) giving an account of
action between Smirhfield and Blackwater Bridge
in which some of his men exhibited shameful
cowardice, the letters are concerned chiefly

with army gossip — deserved

 
Graham, William Alexander fn

 

promotions, etc., and arrands t® which he
wished his father to attend. Letters of 184
indicate that Graham was transferred to the
Adjutant General's office in Raleigh, though
the War of the Rebellion...Records do not cor-
roborate this. Several of these letters allude
to the Vance-Holden election and W. A. Graham,
Senior's, support of Vance.

Perhaps the most valuable portion of this
addition 1s the post-war correspondence whibh

indicates the difficulty with which the whites

 

 
Graham, William Alexander aE

 

adjusted, both economically and politically,
to the new status of the Negro. W. A. Graham,
Junior's, letters to his father indicate that
they owned several sizeable plantations around
Lincoln county, N.C., and possibly in York
District, 5.C. They give detailed accounts

of the production and sale of corn, wheat, and
cotton. There are scattered references to a
saw mill, a grist mill, a charcoal furnace,
and the working of gold, iron, and copper

veins.

 
Graham , William Alexander -8-

 

There are indications that Graham (Jr. )
figured in local politics.

Sometime in the latter part of 1863 or
early months of 1864, Graham married Miss
Julia R. Lane of Amelia Co., Va. They had
a daughter, Florrie, born in 1866.

Army camp life, furlauughs, pay, promotions, and
army surgeons; on Frederickburg, Va., after the
battle there; on the first day's battle at Gett
sburg (Grant was captured at Gettsburg on the
second day); and on prison life and conditions
first at Libby Prison at Richmond, Va. (July 19,

 
Grant, George W. 3
1863-May 6, 1864), then at "Prisoners' Camp" at
Camp Oglethorpe, Macon, Georgia (May 17-July 27
1864), next at Roper Hospital, Charleston S.C.

(July 29-Oct. 5, 1864), and finally at the Con-
federate Military Prison at Columbia, S.C. (fro
m Oct. 5, 1864 until Grant's release in April,

 

1865).

To supplement, the letters and give more de-
tailed pictures of prison life are several im
@ex diaries recorded by Grant, covering the
following dates of his various imprisonments:
July 3-Sept. 26, 1863; Jan. 1-Feb. 20, 1864;

 
Grant, George W. 3
and April 12-May 21, 1864. These diaries give
very good daily accounts of Grant's prison ex-
periences - his food, his recreation, the ex-

aggerated accounts of the War he gets from the
Confederate newspapers; prison rumors concern-
ing the war and prisoner exchange, his efforts

 

at escape, the escape and recapture of prison-
ers, prisoners' health, prison religious ser-
vices, prisoner discussion groups such as the
"Libby Lyceum", prisoner marches, and Confeder-
ate reaction to the War's program. In addition
a written account by Grant is included of his

last days in prison at Macon and his transfer
to Charleston, including valuable information
on the Yankee siege of Charleston during the
summer of 1864.

Two poems, "The Battle of Frederieksburg"
and "Sherman's March to the Sea", by Union
prisoners, and a few bills and receipts, are
included.

Hugh Gladney Grant was born in Birmingham,
Ala., Sept. 2, 1888, the son of William Curtis
Grant. Grant held an A.B. degree from Howard
College, A.B., A.M. and LL.D. degrees from Har-

vard University, and an A.M. from George
Washington University. He also worked toward a
doctorate in the latter institution, starting
in the fall of 1928, but he did not complete
the requirements for it.

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney

 

Grant worked as a newspaper reporter and
special correspondent on political subjects,
engaged in educational work for the City of
Birmingham, the state of Alabama, and the United
States Government, and served in the United
States Army in 1918. From 1919 to 1921 he
worked for the Federal Board for Vocational

Education, during 1921-1923 he worked for the
Alabama State Board of Education, and from 1923
to 1927 he taught political science and

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney

 

journalism at Alabama Polytechnic Institute,
Auburn, Ala. At the time he resigned in 1927
to go to Washington as the personal secretary
of his longtime friend, newly-elected Senator
Hugo L. Black, he was also secretary-treasurer
of the API Alumni Association. There are a
number of records relating to API during the

time that Grant was with that institution, and
Auburn friends kept in touch with him after he
left. He was one of the opponents of President
Speight Dowell of API who later became president

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney

 

of Mercer University.

In 1933 Grant was appointed to the Division
of Western European Affairs in the Department
of State. He was rewarded again in 1935 for
his support of President Franklin D. Roosevelt
by being appointed Envoy Extraordinary and
Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States
to Albania. This collection ends with Grant
leaving Albania in the fall of 1939 after
Mussolini took over the country completely.
Brief information about his life and career

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney

after that time may be found in Who's Who in
America, 1976-1977, Vol. 1. Fora description
of a collection of his papers (1924-1933)
numbering 800 items that is at the Library of
Congress see the 1980 volume of the National
Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections.

The topics covered in most detail in this
collection other than the career of Grant are
the roles of Senators Heflin and Black, the
controversy over Black's appointment to the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1937, Alabama and National

 

 

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 6

 

Democratic politics, the Depression, particular-
ly in Alabama, the Bonus March on Washington in
1932, Albania and its King Zo0g, sem@ admini-
stration of the U.S. Legation in that country,
and the rise of Mussolini and Hitler.

Grant's diaries, as the subject entries for
this collection will show, constitute one of

the most substantive segments of the collection.
The diary he kept while in Washington begins in
typed form on Oct. 11, 1927, three weeks after
he had begun as secretary to Senator Black.

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney

 

It continues through 1931, except for a gap
between Mar. 4, 1929, and Sept. 29, 1929.
Grant's U.S. diary from Jan. 1, 1931 to June 19,
1934, is in the form of notes on memorandum
slips in his handwriting, which is difficult to
read. Only one volume of diary for his service
in Albania is in this collection. It numbers

four hundred pages and runs from Feb. 21 to
Apr. 1, 1938. In that diary, as in his other
diary, he gives his opinions of many people.
They included Dr. Louis Hackett, Assistant

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney

 

Director of the Rockefeller Foundation and
stationed in Rome, Anthony Eden, Neville
Chamberlain, King Zog of Albania, Senators
Black, James Thomas Heflin, and John H. Bank-
head II of Alabama, and Charles A. Lindbergh.

He expressed the fear early in 1938 of a
colossal war starting within two or three years.

He recorded the opinion that because of the
activities of Mussolini and Hitler, Chamberlain
and the ultra-conservatives in Great Britain
whom he represented realized that that country

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney

 

was not ready to fight and hoped to go on
bluffing with Mussolini and Hitler. He gave

an unfavorable view of King Zog (in a number of
letters he spoke well of him), and commented on
the hold the Italians had in controlling
Albania. He mentioned that his telephone con-
versations were listened in on, some of his
letters opened or lost, that most Albanians in
the Government did not have the American brand
of honesty, his criticism of clerks in the U.S.
Department of State, his discussions with a

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 10

 

number of Albanian government officials on
international affairs, King Zog's marriage in
1938 to Countess Apponyi of Hungary (her mother
was an American), Zog's dismissal of Sir Jocelyn
Percy, who had come to Albania twelve years
earlier to reorganize the Gendarmerie, and ar-
rangements for the visits of the three Albanian

princesses, sisters to King Zog, to the United
States in 1938.

The U.S. Diary is much more revealing about
Grant's attitude toward Senator Black and his

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney

 

relationship with him than is the correspondence
In criticizing Black for the traits (some of
which were social) that he considered lacking in
personality and his treatment of him, especially
relative to his salary, he did not fail to
mention Black's tremendous industry and dedi-
cation to his senatorial responsibilities and
that he was a liberal and not a fanatic. He
recorded that he had known since Black's
campaign in 1926 that he was a Klansman but that
Black evidently knew from his conversation and

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney Lé

 

attitude that he was not. In 1937, when there
was so much criticism, a considerable amount of
which appears in the clippings in this col-
lection, of President Roosevelt's appointement
of Black to the Supreme Court, Grant predicted
that he would be liberal in his interpretation
of the Constitution.

Especially in the first years of Black's
senatorship, Grant often sat in the Senate
gallery and afterward recorded his observations
and impressions of many of the Senators. He

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 13

 

made numerous comments in his diary about Sena-
tor Thomas Heflin and his contesting the
election of John H. Bankghead II as his suc-
cessor. He considered Heflin an embarrassment
to his native state. On Jan. 13, 1930, he wrote
that Black had indicated that he had broken with
Heflin, who continued to ride the anti-Catholic

issue, and had definitely broken with the Ku
Klux Klan. After Congress adjourned in 1931,
Grant spent six months operating Black's office
in Birmingham. On p. 190 of his 1930-1931 diary
he recorded his disillusionment over Black's

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 14

 

sense of justice where he was concerned because
he would not increase his salary as a result of
his having to maintain a residence both in
Washington for his wife and daughter and in
Birmingham for six months and for having to pay
his own expenses when campaigning that year in
Alabama for Black, who was already actually

running for re-election to the Senate in 1932.
He also unburdened himself in his diary about
how self-absorbed politicians become. Sometimes
he mentioned the advice he gave Black and

whether or not he accepted it. Grant's diary

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney

 

entry of May 10, 1932, reveals particular
bitterness toward Black. The diary, as well as
a number of theater and-concert programs, are
indicative of the interest of the Grants in
cultural events.

Both Black and Grant worked hard for the
election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 and

for his reelection in 1936. On Sept. 2, 1932,

Grant wrote that he originated the plan for the
National Men's Roosevelt-for-President Club of

Capitol Hill that was comprised of male

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney Lo

 

secretaries to Representatives and Senators.
Grant became restless managing Black's sena-
torial office where during some years of the
depression, so Grant often wrote, from two to
four hundred letters came on the average each
day from constituents that had to be answered
and numerous constituents visited in the hope,
usually vain, that a job or some assistance
could be obtained for them. Actually, the
plight of Alabamians during the Depression as
revealed in this collection could serve as a

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney LF
case study of its effects on the people of this
country. Being ambitious and hard-working, and
needing more income for his family, Grant hoped
that he could get a ministership in 1933 to
some small country, preferably Albania. He
made many contacts within the Democratic Party

 

hierarchy and persuaded Black to work also in
his behalf. His efforts did get him the appoint-
ment in the Department of State, where, ac-
cording to his diary entry of May 3, 1934, he
wrote the speech Secretary of State Cordell

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney L38

 

Hull broadcast on General Lafayette on coast-to-
coast and international radio hook-ups. This
was the occasion of the 100th anniversary of
Lafayette's death.

Grant continued to seek a ministership, and
he succeeded in being appointed Minister to
Albania on July 26, 1935. The record of his

extensive efforts to receive that appointment
give insight into the persistence and skill that
can be required in obtaining such an appointment
On Aug. 9, 1916, Grant married Cora Dean
Hibbs, daughter of Dr. Henry H. Hibbs, a Baptist

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney LS
minister. After the Grants moved to Washington,
Mrs. Grant also attended George Washington Uni-
versity and received an M.A. degree from that
institution. The Grants's only child was Esther
Louise, who was born on Aug. 26, 1917. Grant
was a Baptist and a Mason. His racial bias

 

shows occasionally in the papers, and parti-

cularly in his diary of 1927-1928. There are
many family letters in the collection, and his
letters from his mother reveal that she was a
very positive, un-Reconstructed individual who

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 20

 

despised Abraham Lincoln. The contents of the
personal letters may be summarized as revealing
information about the relationship between Grant
and his wife, and with their daughter, her
education in Europe and at William and Mary
College, relationships among the Hibbs family
and between the Hibbses and the Grants, Grant's

concerns about his elderly parents and their
problems, and the relationships between Grant
and his wife and their friends. There is much
information in the collection about Alabama
politics, and some of it appears in personal

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 22

 

letters addressed to Grant.

Grant's criticism of Black did not show in
his letters to Black. One thing that bothered
Grant about Black was nepotism. He had his wife
on his payroll for awhile, and saw that some of
his other relatives got federal jobs, including

his nephew whom he appointed to succeed Grant
as his personal secretary. The correspondence
of Black's senatorial office is divided between
this collection and the one at the Library of
Congress. The amount and nature of the

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 22

 

correspondence in this collection prove that
that office was operated efficiently while Grant
served as Black's secretary.

The Grants sailed on the Washington on
Sept. 25, 1935, for Le Havre, France, hoping to
arrive in Tirana, Albania, around Oct. 15. In
the early months following their arrival in

 

Tirana, Grant wrote that they were enjoying
their new experiences and had found "an air of
fine cordiality and hospitality" in the capital.
He said the Legation was well planned for

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 23

 

entertaining, "being large and commodious, al-
though some of the furniture and rugs need re-
placement." The Legation Interpreter and
Translator was Kol Kugali® The Government-
controlled newspaper in Tirana was Drita. By
May 16, 1936, Grant was writing to Cordell Hull
about the chaotic condition in the clerk's

office of the Legation and the imperative need
of a capable clerk for that office. In Tirana,
Grant supervised both a diplomatic and a con-
sular office. He had problems whos a number of
Many wypecl ClhnuUritle -

Grant, Hugh Gladney 24
the employees and with the water system for the
Legation, and he undertook major renovation and
redecoration within the Legation building
during the summer of 1938. On Feb. 14, 1938,
he wrote to his mother that supervising a
government-owned plant and several foreign
employeees, keeping up contacts with his col-

 

leagues in the Diplomatic Corps, calling and re-
ceiving callers, and writing reports to the
State Department added up to a very demanding
position. He traveled extensively in Albania,

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney

 

meeting with many government and religious
officials. He wrote letters to Albanians in
Albanian, and had copies of them in both
Albanian and English made for the Legation files.
While serving as Minister, most of Grant's
correspondence is of a diplomatic nature. His
dispatches to the Secretary of State constitute
a separate category in the arrangement of the
collection.

Only a portion of the records relative to the
extensive entertaining that the Grants did in

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 26

 

the Legation and of their invitations to social
events in Albania were retained when this col-
lection was processed. The amount and nature of
the records retained give some notion of how
seriously the Grants took their responsibilities
as representatives of the United States abroad
in social relationships as well as in other

areas for which they were responsible. Mrs.
Grant suffered frequently from illness, and
during the summer of 1938 was in the United
States, spending most of her time with her

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney ZL

 

daughter. In 1936, Grant received permission
from the State Department to return to the
United States to campaign for Roosevelt. He
spoke in five states and conferred with Roose-
velt. He said that Black campaigned that year
in seventeen states for Roosevelt.

In April, 1936, the Reverend Henry H. Hibbs
died in the pulpit after preaching in Hazard,
Kentucky. His daughter Esther (Hibbs) Barnes
wrote a lenthly letter to Mrs. Grant about the
last days, death, and burial of their father.

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 28

 

His obituary that is attached to a letter of
May 1, 1936, names his survivors who included
his wife and eight children.

The folder on King Zog's wedding on Apr. 27,
1938, in the Miscellany contains an undated,
twenty-page article on the courtship and marri-
age of King Zog to Countess Geraldine Apponyi
that was written by Mrs. Grant. Her desire to
write articles for publication in this country
appears to have died aborning.

In September and October of 1937, Grant,

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 29

 

accompanied by his wife and daughter, visited
Balkan and Central European capitals on a fact-
finding Mission for the State Department. Most
of the pictures in the collection are small
photographs that the Grants took on that trip.
The other pictures are largely of the Grants
and Albanians.

On July 17, 1938, Grant wrote to his wife a
frank letter about the uncertainty of his future
career and his concern for the future of all
three of the Grants. On July 28, 1939, he wrote

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 30
that the U.S. Legation in Tirana was being
closed. Mussolini had taken over the country
immediately after the birth of King Zog's son,
and the royal family fled the country. Grant
was instructed by the State Department to ship
part of the furnishings to the U. S. Legation
in Estonia, part of them to the Legation in

 

Greece, and part to the U. S. Embassy in Rome.
Grant's last letter was written on Sept. 1l,
1939, and it was relative to the shipment of
furniture to the Legation in Athens. Presumably

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney ee!

 

the Grants left Tirana soon thereafter.

Among the press releases that Grant acquired
while working for the State Department in
Washington are a number of addresses by Presi-
dent Roosevelt and Secretary Cordell Hull.
Reports of his conversations with King Zog about
the state of affairs in Albania and the rest of

Europe appear in the dispatches to the State
Department. Nearly all of the several folders
of memoranda concern Albania and the admini-
stration of the Legation.

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 32

 

Subjects covered in the clippings include:
Albania, other Balkan countries, John Hollis
Bankhead II, Hugo Lafayette Black, Bonus
Expeditionary Force, the Grants, Italy, and the
Little Entente. The clippings about Albania
and the other Balkan countries are numerous.
They are principally either in French or trans-

lations from Albanian newspapers.

Among the several categories of material is
a file of a survey Senator Black made in the
fall of 1931 of all cotton producing states.

 
Grant, Hugh Gladney 32
The information sought in the survey was the
estimated size of the year's cotton crop, and
the relief plans, if any, formulated in the
States to offset the low prices of that year's
crop of cotton.

Sir William Grant (1752-1832), British
politician, was a member of the House of Commons,
1790-1812, and held, among others, the offices
of solicitor general, 1799-1801, and master of
the rolls, 1801-1817.

This collection consists mostly of letters

addressed to Grant by prominent political
leaders, churchmen, jurists, members of the
royal family, and others. Those letters with-

out an addressee's name on them were probably

 
Grant, Sir William ; 2

 

written to Grant as were virtually all of the
identifiable ones, The manuscripts were bound
into a scrapbook that, because of its poor
condition, was dismantled. The scrapbook was
owned or compiled by J. J. Frobisher of Dawlish,

Devonshire, whose name appeared on the first
page. Most of the manuscripts may have belonged
to the Frobishers instead of having been collect
ed Py them from a variety of sources. On

April 29, 1823, Grant wrote to his sister and

 
Grant, Sir William

 

added his regards to a Mrs. Frobisher. The
front cover and first page of the scrapbook are
filed with the papers. That part of the scrap-
book contained a list of contents, some of which
are not in this collection--for example, letters

of Dr. Johnson and Sir Walter Scott.

The more notable manuscripts are described in
the following paragraphs.

Edmund Burke's letter (facsimile) of Feb. 12,
1788, concerned arrangements for his box at the

trial of Warren Hastings. This letter is pub-
lished in The Correspondence of Edmund Burke
(Chicago, 1958-1970), V, 378-379, where the
determination of its dating is explained.

On June 21, 1798, Henry Dundas, Secretary of
War, urged Grant to attend the House of Commons
on the next day in order to counter Charles

James Fox. Pitt would not be there, and Dundas
was ill. Dundas expressed their thanks for a

speech, This letter is dated only "Saturday"

 

 
Grant, Sir William _ s is b)
but it may date from Saturday, June 23, 1793,
and relate to the letter of the 21st.

Pitt offered Grant the post of solicitor
general (July 12, 1799).

Charles Alexandre de Calonne, the exiled
French statesman, explained why he had to change
attorneys. The letter is undated but may date
in 1801 when Grant became master of the rolls.
Calonne congratulated Grant about a new position.

When Pitt became prime minister again in 1804
he asked Grant to introduce him in the House of
Commons (May 18).

Henry Mackenzie, the novelist, discussed the

 

 
Grant, Sir William 6
condition of his brother-in-law, Sir James Grant
Eighth Baronet, whose family had recently suf-
fered two calamities (March 17, 1805).

The Duke of Northumberland reported the elec-
tion of his son, Lord Percy (Oct. 12, 1806).

George III was pleased with the debate on the
Orders in Council (Feb. 6, 1808).

Prime Minister Perceval made arrangements for
housing the troops garrisoning the Tower of Lon-
don (July 24, 1810).

Lord Eldon conveyed Lord Liverpool's wis
that Grant remain one more term as master of the

On Feb, 2, 1822, Reginald Heber solicited
help in being appointed preacher at Lincoln's
Inn,

On April 29, 1823, Grant wrote to his sister
about the death of their brother Charles.

Henry Phillpotts, newly appointed Bishop of

Exeter, noted his good reception by the clergy
re ied despite the London press (Jan. 28,
831).

On Sept. 24, 1831, William, Van Mildert, Bigh-

op of Durham, recommended Hug

theologian, as preacher for Lincoln's inn.

In May, 1836, theologian John Abercrombie
(1780-1844) discussed his ideas for future writ-
ing--themes that soon appeared in his publica-
tions. The addressee is unknown (Grant was
dead by this time).

The content of the other letters is not par-

 

ticularly useful, but the correspondents are
persons of note--Chatham, Clarendon, Peel,
Romilly, Queen Caroline, Liverpool, Ganning,

Princess Augusta, etc.

John William Grantham (a. 1887) served in
the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1872
and 1881. He was state senator from Jeffer-
son County from 1872 till 1877. There are
ten letters concerning his political career,
and one petition (Dec. '72) against removal

of the West Virginia capital from Charles-
town to Wheeling.
The majority of the collection concerns

 
Grantham, John W. -2-

 

the business papers of a typical country
store, run by John W. Grantham and James W.
League, in Middleway, W. Va. from 1850 to
1890,

Included also are some papers concerning
Grantham's local agency for the Arlington
Mutual Life Insurance Co., of Charlottesville
Virginia, in the 1870's.

There are some family letters of the Gran-

thams. There were five children born to Mr.
and Mrs. John W. Grantham, namely: Rose,
Edith, Linden, Joseph, and Lillian.

from Hudson, Wood & Co., Purchasing Agents
in New York, offer Grantham a chance to join
their counterfeit money racket, in most open

Danville, Pittsylvania County, Va.
8,002 pteces;: 118 volumes

 

This collection, consisting almost altogether

of a series of excellent and complete mer-
cantile records centers chiefly around the
activities of “4lliam Clark Grasty and John
F. Rison, although Samuel Pannill and Philip
L. Grasty, John 8. Grasty, William Rison,

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (2)
William H. Wooding, and Claiborne
also figure in the same activities. The
few personal papers furnish little aid for
understanding the family connections of
the group, but it appears that there were
connections by blood and marriage.

From a letter of Samuel Pannill to
Philip L. Grasty, May 29, 1800, it would
seem that both came from Orange County, Va
although there 1s no definite proof. Wil-
liam Clark Grasty apparently was not the

 

* 3

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (3)
son of Philip Grasty, as might be deduced
from the records, but of J. W. Grasty of
Mount Atry, Pittsylvania County, Va. (See
letter of J. W. Grasty to William Clark
Grasty, May 21, 1836). William GC. and John
S. Grasty referred to their "Aunt Claiborne"

 

thus establishing proof of a connection
between the Grastys and the Claibornes. A
sister of William C. and John S. Grasty
married William H. Wooding of Danville be-
fore 1850. By 1851 William Clark Grasty

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (4)

and his wife "Tish" had foure children,

Samuel (later killed in the Civil War),

James, Octavia, perhaps the one seeat ae

"Jennie", and William C., Jr., ntioned

in 1859.

The personal letters in the collection
are restricted to a fairly large number from
John 8. Grasty to his brother William Clark
Grasty, several from Jennie Grasty to her
mother, and one from J. W. Grasty to his
son, William Clark Grasty. Only those from

 

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (5)

 

John S. Grasty are of any appreciable value.
John 8. Grasty's letters span the period
from 1849 to 1867. By 1849 John S. had ai~
ready been educated for the ministry, ap-
parently at Washington College in Lexington
and was holding a charge at Yanceyville,

N. C. Grasty next wrote from Madison, N,
C.; but, in 1858 he removed to Fincastle in
Botetourt County, Va., where he remained
until 1867 when he removed to “helbyville,

Ky. to serve as Presbyterian minister. One

 
Grasty, “William Ylark & John F. Rison

Sketch (6)
letter from Yanceyville in 1852 describes
the high values of tobacco and wheat lands
between Yanceyville and Danville, and
another from the same place takes his brother
William Clark Grasty to task for being too
grasping, hinting very strongly that per-

 

haps William C. Grasty was not being en-
tirely hones in suing a relative about a
legacy. John S, Grasty also wrote numerous
_letters from Madison, N. C., but his most
interesting letters came from Fincastle

 
Grasty, Williem Clark & John R. Rison
_Sketch (7)

 

during the Givil War. One especially in-
teresting, December 20, 1863, described
the depredations of "Averill and his ras-
cally command" in destroying lives and
property in Botetourt and surrounding
counties. He also mentioned a rumor that

Aver’11 escaped punishment because of

Fitzhugh Lee's intoxication. His letters
from Fincastle give accounts of the Union
sympahties of people of Dutch and Dunkard

lineage.

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (8)

During 1859 and 1860 John S. Grasty
several times mentioned "Forney the artist!
whom he had commissioned to do a portrait
of William C. Grasty (March 9, July 12,
1859, and March 5 and Dec. 7, 1860). On
one occagsion he had heard from Forney in

 

Milton, N. C. John S. Grasty's letters
were often concerned with the hiring of

his slaves and other types of income. It
appears that Grasty, though a Bresbyterian
minister, was possessed of no scanty patri-

mony. e

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (9)

The bulk of the collection, however,
consists of the mercantile records of sev-
eral firms over a period of two generations,
all centering around the Grastys and Ri-
sons in Pittsylvania County, Va. Samuel

 

Pannill seems to have been the senior
partner in the beginning. Samuel Pannill
on Oct. 25, 1799, wrote from Green Hill

in Pittsylvania County, Val, to Philip

L. Grasty of Stony Hill 1n the same county

 
x

srasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (10)

sending some merchandise to Grasty and some
to Pannill. Although in 1800 the firm
was known as Grasty and Pannill, Samuel
Pannill two years later, Aug. 2, 1802,
wrote to Philip L. Grasty, merchant in
Pittsylvania County, a rather unfriendly
letter because he considered that Grasty
had not treated him in an honest fashion.

Most of the material in the early part
of the collection concerns Philip L. Grasty's
store at Stony Hil] where Grasty kept a gen-

’

 

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (11)
eral stock of goods, owned a small planta-
tion on which he kept an overseer and car-
ried on a general mercantile business as
well. In the early years most of the goods
were purchased at Petersburg, Va., at ad-
vances of better than 100 per cent. Gras-

 

ty changed his chief place of purchasing to
Richmond, Va., in the 1820's. He accented
the produce of his own vicinity (brandy,
dried apples, tobacco, beeswax, corn, wheat,

chestnuts, etc.) in exchange for goods, on

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (12)
a barter arrangement, and carried on a very
diversified type of merchandising. In 1806
Grasty moved his store from Stony Hill to
Mount Airy in Pittsylvania County, and con-
tinued his general merchandising there un-
til his death in 1827. His records during
this period give a good indication of the
drugs, books, clothing, dry-goods, and
hardware generally in demand; the omigin
of his wholesale purchasing; the barter
arrangement so common in the period; and

 

 
Grasty, William Clark & James F. Rison
Sketch (13)
the diversified type of business carried on,
For example, in the 1820's, Grasty kept a
tavern in addition to his general store;
still ran his plantation; had a black-smith
shop; served as local post-master at Mount
Airy; and had a simplified type of banking
for advancing money to his customers and
accepting money for safe keeping. With the
death of Philip L. Grasty in 1827 the store
was closed. During this period the col-
lection contains countless orders sent to

 

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (14)

 

Grasty for goods to be sold to the bearer
who in numerous cases was a slave. There

were also many receipts, mortgages and notes.

One especially interesting item, in the
form of a broadside, is a "Catalogue of

Books" labelled "F. Collins 1823 Catalo-

gue" 4n handwriting. During the 1820's
the set also includes many blanks for the
use of the postmaster.

As a whole, the collection, before
1827, shows that Grasty's business acti-

vities covered a 6@ wide area surround-

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (15)
ing Pittsylvania County.

William C. Grasty, with whom the re-
mainder of the material is chiefly con-
cerned, was a minor at the time of Philip's
death. Before he reached legal age, how-

> he

ever, his guardian gave permission for

 

Grasty to purchase a store at Mount Airy.
This was in 1818 when William was apparently
around 18 years of age and when he had
already clerked for three years in the

store of another man and had saved some

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (16)

$700 with which he interided to start his

own business. William's type of business

was very similar to that which Philip L.

Grasty had carried on, in spite of the

fact that more than a quarter of a century

had elapsed since the founding of the store

 

at Mount Airy. He continued the same type
of general store; carried on barter; bought
tobacco; engaged in a simplified form of
banking; in the early period became a school
commissioner for educating the poor in his

section; ran a “6 was justice of the

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison

. Sketch (17)
the peace; served as Post Master and owned
a plantation although he hired out so me of
the slaves which had come to him through
his marriage.

In 1838, Grasty went to Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and New York to purchase
goods, although he was soon to become in-
volved in the trouble so common to merchants
after the panic of-1837. He then changed
his purchases to wholesale market nearer
home. A letter book in the 1840's indi-

cates the — he had. The records

 

 
Grasty, William Chark & John R. Rison
Sketch (18)

of the Mount Airy store from 1839 to the

early 1850's picture a social and economic

record of the conditions of merchandising

at that time. For example, such things

as barter, clerk hire, cash and credit

sales, terms on which goods could be pur-

 

chased wholesale, the amount of yearly busi-
ness done, etc. are clearly pictured.
Some time, perhaps in the 1840's,
Grasty moved his business operations to
the larger town of Danville, Va. The story

 
Grasty, William Clark & John R. Rison
Sketch 9)
is not wholly clear through here, but in
the early 1850's Grasty and Lewis had a
tobacco factory, and somewhat later Grasty
arranged to enter a general mercantile
business with Woodging and Claiborne. This
failed to develop and Grasty finally joined

 

John F, Rison at Danville in a general mer-
cantile, and forwarding and commission busi-
ness, While Grasty had sold goods in the
$100 a month in the little country store

at Mount Airy, the new firm in Danville i=

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch _(20)

 

was selling goods to the amount of $800 and
$1,000 a month. ‘here is an interesting
contrast in the amount of store rent, clerk
hire, and other expenses necessary to carry
on the larger business in Danville as com-
pared with the samll store at Mount Airy.
The Danville business seems to have been
carried on until the middle of the 1870's.
A letter. book accouht after the Civil War
Sives a rather detailed pvicture of the
business of Grasty and Rison at Danville.

 
Grasty, “illiam Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (21)

Perhaps one of the most interesting
phases of the business lies in the large
amount of tobacco handled by the firm, in
great volume during the 1850's but for
storage and sale during the war period.
Contrary to the case with many merchants,
Grasty and Rison were advantagiously located
during the war period. Danville was not
bothered by the enemy until the surrender
and transportation facilities were not
overtaxed by war activites as at Petersburg

 

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (22)
and Mtichmond. Consequently many commission
merchants from all parts of Virginia stored
their stock, especially tobscco, with Grasty
and Rison. It is doubtful that any one
collection offers a better opportunity for
studying the tobacco trade during the Civil

 

War than these Grasty-Rison papers.

Before, during, and after the Civil
War, there is an abundance of correspondence
from thomas M. and Edwin M. Holt, early cot-
ton mill operators at Haw River, Holt's Store

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison

Sketch (23)
and Graham in N. ©. ‘the Holts sold yarns
and cloth to the Danville firm. In no let-
ters do the effects of the Civil War on
Grasty and Rison's business show more clearl
than those from the Holts. Thomas M, Holt,
especially, in the late 1860's was forced

 

to write many letters demanding pay from
the old Danville firm. The letters from
the Holt& also throw much light on their
activities. Few collections reveal the vol-
ume of trade in fertilizer as clearly as the

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (24)
records of Grasty and Rison. They sold
large quantities of Peruvian guano prior to
1861. Later the correspondence reveals in
detail the supplanting of Peruvian guano by
chemical fertilizers. Agents of the latter
firms commented on the necessity of winning

 

people away from the use of Peruvian guano,
and Gasty and Rison began to buy such pio-
neers in the development of chemical fertil-
izers as Kettlewell (Manipulated Guano) and
John 8. Reese (soluble Pacific Guano) both

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (25)

of Baltimore. ‘here 1s also much correspon-
dence with Allison and Addison, producers

of commerdial fertilizers in Richmond, Va.

In a similar fashion the collec#ion

contains much correspondence from such firms
as commission houses in Richmond, Haxall and

 

Crenshaw Flour Mills and J. W. Cardwell,
manufacturer of farm machinery, also of
Richmond. There are numerous letters from
prominent planters, such as Isaac C. Car-
rington of Amelia County, Va., Alexander

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (26)

Bruce of Halifax County, Va., Samuel C.

Shelton of Patrick County, Va, all seeking

to se@ their crops through Grady ana Rison.
Grasty and Rison were often asked to

do personal errands for their customers,

to forward goods and to accept any type of

 

product; for example John Grasty, in 1860,
sent them 100 pounds of gold ore from Glade
H111 Gold Mines, Franklin County, Va. to

be forwarded to Baltimore. Perhans the singl
task requested most often was that hire for

 
Grasty, William Clark & John F. Rison
Sketch (27)

negro slaves be collected and forwarded. It
1s doubtful that any errands requested of
them exceeds the request for the collec-
tion of negro hire.

It 1s likely that the rapid decline
of the Grasty and Rison firm after the

 

Civil War was as much due to the burning
of their "house" in the winter of 1864-
1865 as to the depressed conditions fol-
lowing the war. After 1865, however, the
collection contains freauent statements of

 
Grasty, William Clark and John F. Rison
Sketch (28)
petitions for bankruptcy with Grasty and
Rison usually listed as creditors. Never-
theless, the collection 1s extremely valu-
able for light thrown on a prominent mer-
cantile firm for three quarters of a
century.

he was appealing for an increase of rank from
major to lieutenant colonel. The addressee

of the letter dated May, 1790, was not given.
A second letter probably dates from the same
year, and it was addressed to Henry Addington,
Speaker of the House of Commons, Grattan
criticized the handling of his case by Sir
George Yonge, Secretary for War.

An undated, unaddressed letter from Lucia
Grattan has a watermark of 1800. She was
appealing to the East India Company for a
pension for herself and her four children.

John J. Gravatt was a Surgeon in the Confe-
derate Army. He was the Medical Officer in
Charge at General Hospital No. 9 in Richmond,

Va.
There is evidence that Gravatt may have been

John James Gravatt, who was a physician in Port
Royal at one time. This man was a graduate of
William and Mary College, and he received the
M.D. degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
(See Men of Mark in Virginia, Vol. IV, p. 149.)

The letter, dated November 16, 1864, is a
report by Assistant Surgeon S. P. Christian on
his trip to North Carolina to put a group of
sick and wounded soldiers on the train.

Gray, Francis Calley. Papers, 1811-1515.
Boston, Suffolk Co., Massachusetts

 

Francis Calley Gray (1790-1856) was the son
of William Gray of Salem, Massachusetts, who
became very rich in the shipping business after
the Revolutionary War. Young Frank Gray, a
Harvard graduate and friend of many prominent

New Englanders, accompanied John Quincy Adams
to Russia in 1809 as unpaid secretary to the
United States Legation in St. Petersburg.

His diary begins on Sept. 17, 1811, as he

 
Gray, Francis Calley 2

 

starts his journey home across Europe and it
closes on Feb. 17, 1815, at “Monticello,” the
home of Thomas Jefferson.

The history of this little red leather-
bound volume is noted in the introduction of
the publication, Thomas Jefferson in 1814,
edited by Henry S. Rowe and T. Jefferson

 

Collidge, Jr. Mr. Rowe was closely associated
with William Gray, a nephew who inherited the
diary, and thus Mr. Rowe knew personally what
had happened to the little manuscript. The

 
Gray, Francis Calley

 

portion of the diary he chose to publish does-
not begin until Dec. 13, 1814, when Frank Gray
left Boston on a journey south to Virginia
with George Tichnor; hence the notes on his
European travels, 1811-1812, are unpublished.
As he proceeded through Russia, Estonia, and
Prussia, he remarked on the condition of the

natives as well as the delapidation of Russian
travel conveyances. After Frank Gray reached
Berlin his account is much more detailed,
noting libraries, palaces, art galleries,

 
Gray, Francis Calley 4

 

scientific cabinets, and churches. Evidently
he began his collection of etchings with
purchases made in Berlin and Dresden.

Frank Gray arrived in France on Oct. 24,
1811, after which his diary notes little about
Paris. He entered England on April 27, 1612,
and his journal stops after a brief account

of his journey to Liverpool.

Iwo years and more later he began another
narrative. His trip to see Jefferson is a
detailed account which Mr. Rowe published with

 
Gray, Francis Calley
explanatory footnotes and an index.
