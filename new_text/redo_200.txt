Manigault, Louis. Papers, 1776-1883.
Charleston, South Carolina.

 

Pierre Manigault, a French Protestant,
immigrated from France to South Carolina
sometime late in the seventeenth century.
His son, Gabriel (1704-1781) became a mer-
chant and accumulated a large fortune. Ga-

briel's son, Peter (b.1731) read law at the
Inner Temple, toured Europe extensively, and
in 1754 returned to Charleston where he
opened a law office.

The Manigault family papers begin with

 
Manigault, Louis. 2
Peter Manigault'’s children, the fourth gen-
eration in America. Joseph Manigault, who
apparently left South Carolina during the
Revolution, wrote three letters to his fa-
mily in America. On August 7, 1781, he des-
cribes English privateering off the North
American coast. On October 1 he tells of

 

his problems of residing in England, es-
pecially of making a living. He speaks of
the Carolina Coffee House and of various
Royalists in England. On May 8, 1783, he
relates the difficulties of collecting his

 
Manigault, Louis.

inheritance from an estate, possibly his
grandfather's, which was being held for him
by the East India Company. At this time he
was probably studying law at the Inner Temple.

There are no letters or papers in the
collection from 1783-1802.

About 1800 Gabriel Manigault married
Margaret Izard, the daughter of General
Ralph Izard and Alice (De Lancey) Izard.
From 1802 until 1808 the children of Ralph
Izard write a series of personal letters to

Gabriel Manigault. On August 21, 1806,

 

 
Manigault, Louis. 4
Ralph Izard comments in detail about the
severe drought in Virginia, and on July 6,
1808, Henry Izard writes unfavorably of the
inhabitants in the interior of South Caro-
lina. Other letters before 1810 discuss
the financial affairs of the Manigaults,
the Huger, and Heyward families of South

 

Carolina, the impact of the Embargo on
Charleston (January 3 and January 20, 1809),
the treatment of recalcitrant slaves, social
life in Charleston, and the literary interests
of the Manigaults and Izards.

 
Manigault, Louis 5
Beginning in 1808 Mrs. Margaret (Izard)
Manigault writes a series of letters to her
family, especially her son Gabriel Henry.
Before the death of her husband in 1809 her
letters give a full account of life amongthe
aristocracy in Charleston. In 1809, after
she moved to Philadelphia, her letters con-
tinue but become less frequent. She pictures
life in Philadelphia and family affairs. In
1816 she purchased the Onis Mansion in Phila-
delphia. The correspondence ends with her

death in 1824,

 

 
Manigault, Louis 6

About 1820 the papers of Charles Izard
Manigault, the son of Gabriel and Margaret
(Izard) Manigault begin to dominate the col-
lection. He attended the College of Charleston
and the University of Pennsylvania, fought
briefly in the War of 1812, and then departed
for the Far East, where he hopedto establish
himself as a merchant. ,

While he was in the Far East his friends
wrote him letters telling mainly of social
life in Philadelphia and of business and
financial conditions. Friends whom he met

 

 
Manigault, Louis 7

in the East wrote to him. John Davy, an
English merchant, wrote to him on January 2,
1820, from St. Louis, Mauritania, of the
cholera in Mauritania and of the need to
evacuate the residents of St. Louis. The
epidemic was treated with Glauber's Salt. In
1821 S. von Schuppin, an official in the Dutch

 

East Indies, wrote three letters (May 20,

June 14, and August 27) of a successful
military expedition to the Sumatran province
and town of Palembang, a cholera epidemic in
the Islands, and the improved finances of the

 
Manigault, Louis 8
government. The Governor General who had been
decorated by the King of Holland had decided to
remain in the Island for a few more years.
Another letter from Charles Pearson (August 6,
1822) comments on Coquimbo, Chile, '
Charles Izard Manigault returned about
1820 without a fortune. He managed family
land and became a rice planter. He married
Elizabeth Heyward. All of Charles Izard
Manigault's letters before 1837 are personal
and relate to family matters and friends.
There are letters from young Louis Manigault,

 

 
 

Manigault, Louis ;
He went to school at Mr, Muhlenburg’s Academy at

College Point, Long Island and later attended
Yale University, One of the volumes is his
account book for 1845 while he was a student at
Yale, There is a series of letters to him from
his mother and brother Charles Heyward who
attended Christopher Cotes School in Charleston.

These letters are mainly narratives of family
affairs and events in Charleston, The Mani-
gaults frequently toured Europe, but the collec-

tion contains little mention of their travels,

Among the items

 
Manigault, Louis 10
of note in letters of this period is a lengthy
description of Boston and its foreign trade
(Sept. 16, 1818); the impact of the panic of
1819 in Charleston and Philadelphia (April 16
and 17, 1819); a detailed, unbound travel journal
(1825) written by Elizabeth Heyward Manigault,
Mrs. Charles Izard Manigault, telling of her

 

tour of Philadelphia, New York, the Erie Canal,
Niagara Falls, lower Canada, Quebec, Saratoga,

and Boston; a description of New Orleans (June

16, 1831); the cholera epidemic in Philadelphia
(Aug. 16, 1832); a discussion of South

 
Manigault, Louis 11
Carolina College and the problems faced by
itsnew President, Robert Woodward Barnwell
(June 3, 1836); and anti-Semitic’ sentiment
among the students of Mr. Cotes school in
Charleston (October 2, 1843).

After Louis Manigault left Yale in 1847,
he joined his parents in Europe. He remained

 

there for three years,& in 1851 returned home
via China,. California, and South America.

The papers contain little information on his
travels. In 1852 he joined his father in

the management of the family plantations.

 
Manigault, Louis BBE

The papers relating to the Manigault family
plantations form the most significant part of the
collection. The Manigaults began to acquire
rice-planting land as early as the mid-
eighteenth century, and by 1850 they owned
several plantations: "Gowrie" on Argyle Island;
"Silkhope" on the Cooper River; "Hermitage™ on
the Savannah River; "Combahee;" "Marshlands" nea

 

Charleston; and a plantation near Wilton, S. C.
The papers relating to planting begin in 1837
and continue in abundance to the end of the col-

lection except for the Civil war years. The

 
Manigault, Louis 13

 

bulk of these papers fall before the Civil War
and after 1852 when Louis Manigault assumed
management of Gowrie plantation.

There are work schedules, lists of Negroes,
business papers, and instructions to overseers
on the care of Negroes and the management of
the plantations. Detailed letters from over-
seers begin in 1844 and continue to 1861. From

1848 to 1850 there is a series of "prices cur-
rent" from various Charleston firms. Between
1852 and 1860 there is a series of Hout 150 let

ters from Charles Izard Manigault to his son

 
Manigault, Louis 14
Louis relating to affairs on Gowrie which, like
the other plantations, annually yielded about
15,000 to 20,000 bushels of rice.

The Manigaults occasionally enlarged their
holdings. In 1848 Charles Izard Manigault
purchased the Hermitage plantation on the Savan-
nah River near Gowrie. The land cost $28,000,

 

and $19,000 was required to stock it with slaves.
Here, as in many other places in the collection,
there is an itemized listing of slaves and the
prices paid.

In addition to many letters from overseers,

 
Manigault, Louis 15
there are also letters in the 1840's from
"Habersham and Son," an Augusta firm which aided
in the operation of the estates. After 1852

the Habersham letters are superceded by those

of Louis “anigault whose letters to his father
are filled with the details of planting and
display his desire to become a successful

 

planter. Charles Izard Manigault answers the
letters with advice and instructions.

Three of the volumes relate to Louis's
management of Gowrie. There is an 1852 pre.
scription book of medicine given to slaves, an

1852 note-

 
Manigault, Louis 16
book on the preparation of land for rice planting
and an 1858 memorandum book.

Charles Izard Manigault retained personal
control over all the family plantations. In
addition to placing Louis on Gowrie, he placed
other relatives on plantations. His letters
to Louis indicate that he maintsined tight con-
trol. On one occasion he dismissed the Gowrie
overseer without consulting Louis, who at times
objected to this control (see letters of Jan. 9,
1859 and Jan. 10, 1860).

Papers of Note during this period include:

 

 
Manigault, Louis 17
a series of letters in 1555 relating to slave
patrols near Gowrie and Louis Manigault's efforts
to exempt himself from participation: a letter
of Dec. 2, 1857, in which Charles Izard Mani-
gault offers his opinions on overseers; and a
letter of Jan. 15, 1857, which mentions activi-
ties to keep slave families together.

Thus, before 1861 the papers give an excel-

 

lent picture of antebellum rice planting,
esnecially the profits derived, the construction
and care of trunks and canals, the spring

Blonting, cultivation, harvesting, threshing,

 
Manigault, Louis 18
marketing, the constant threat of floods, the
problems of managing slaves, and their illnesses.
Louis Manigault married Frances (Fanny)
Habersham on Dec. 1, 1857. After an extended
honeymoon in Europe (about which the collection
contains little information) they returned to
Gowrie. They had six children, three of whom

 

lived to maturity: Louis (b. 1858); Josephine
(bo. 1863) and Charles (b. 1866). After her mar-
riage Fanny Manigault's sisters Josephine and
Anna and her mother Mrs. A. W. Habersham write

a series of letters pertaining mainly to family

 
Manigault, Louis 19
events and social life in Vernonburg and Boswell
Ga. These letters continue intermittently to the
end of the collection, even after Fanny Mani-
gault's death in 1868.

Other letters before the Civil War relate
to the Manigault family and social life among the
aristocracy. A letter of Oct. 4, 1860, describes

 

the recently completed Central bark in New York
City and preparations for the approaching visit
of the Prince of Wales.

For the first time in the collection politi-

cal develOpments are mentioned during the

 
Manigault, Louis 20

 

secession crisis. A letter of Dec. ll, 1360,
tells of increased military activities in the
vicinity of Georgetown, S. C. On Dec. 17
Charles Izard Manigault discusses the effects
of disunion on the rice market and commerce in
general. The military buildup in Charleston

is the subject of a letter of Jan. 9, 1861.

A week later the determination of the people of
Charleston to prevent, the reinforcement of Fort
Sumter is discussed. ¥On Jan. 16 Charles Izard
Manigault relates that the slaves in the coastal

regions near Charleston have the notion that

e % Jap. A vet &

 
Manizault, Louis 21
the election of Lincoln has brought emancipation
Many have run away; armed patrols are tracking
them. Five days later the same problem is dis-
cussed. Now "professional Negro hunters" have
been employed. On Feb. 28 he states that masters
have allowed 250 slaves to work on fortifications
on Morris Island, and on March 6 he writes that
the future now depends on Lincoln. On March 21
he says that the evacuation of Sumter is ex-
pected imminently.

After war broke out Louis Manigault entrusted

Gowrie to an overseer and was commissioned a

 

 
Manigault, Lovis 22

 

captain in the Confederate Army. During most of
1861 he was stationed in Savannah to watch
Federal operations along the coast. He sent his
wife and their infant son Louis to Macon, Ga.,
from which place Mrs. Manigault wrote letters
describing her life there. At the end of 1861
he resigned his commission and returned to

manage Gowrie. There are only a few papers
relating to the plantation during the war. In
1864 when Gowrie fell to the Federals he re-
turned to Charleston and worked as a clerk in

the Medical Department in Charleston.

 
Manigault, Louis 23

In the spring of 1561 Louis’ brothers,
Alfred and Gabriel, enlisted as privates in a
South Carolina militia unit (Charleston Light
Dragoons) which was mustered into the Confederate
States Army later in the year as Co.-K,4th South
Carolina Cavalry. A letter of March 24, 1866,
describes their service.

 

In 1864 Gabriel was captured near Louisa
Court House, Va. A letter of Aug. 1, 1864,
tells of his imprisonment at Fort Delaware and
of its conditions. A letter of Aug. 18, 1864,

describes the favors done for him while in priso

 
Manigault, Louis 24
by relatives in Philadelphia. His brother
Alfred died of spinal meningitis while in service
on Feb. 20, 1865, at Winnsboro, S.C. The col-
lection contains only scattered information
about their military careers.

Life in Charleston during the Civil War is
discussed occasionally. A letter of Dec.[?],
1861, relates the dislocation caused by the

 

great fire. On March 8, 1862, a letter des¢ribeg
the lethargy of the people of Charleston toward
the war effort. On the following June 14 a

letter discusses the deserted appearance of

 
Manigault, Louis Fags

 

Charleston; only St. Philip's Church is holding
services for Episcopalians. On Sept. 28, 1864,
Emma Manigault criticizes conditions at
Andersonville prison. At the end of the papers
for 1865 is a cruie map of the prison.

During the war the Manigaults lost all of
their plantations except Silkhope and Gowrie.

Gabriel Edward Manigault managed Silkhope;
Gowrie appears to have been leased to a cousin,
Daniel Heyward, until 1875.

After the war the Manigaults were reduced

to near poverty. In 1867 Louis and his father

 
Manigault, Louis 26

 

attempted to earn money by selling: consignments
of old pre-war Madeira wine to interested
Northern merchants. Two years later Louis took
a position in the import-export firm of Lesesne
and Welles, where he translated letters in Frenc
and Spanish. Although the Manigaults could bare
ly survive financially, they still maintained
their prominent position in Charleston society.
In 1875 Louis Manigault decided to resume
personal manazement of Gowrie which he seems
to have inherited the year before from his fathe

He engaged his cousin, James B. Heyward, as mana

 
Manigault, Louis in 27
ger. During 1576 and 1877 Heyward's letters
describe constant battles against labor problems,
floods, and depressed rice markets. In 1878
Louis abandqned the effort; Heyward then leased
Gowrie. Heyward's letters during 1876 and 1877
constitute the only significant papers in the
collection relating to rice planting after 1865.
In the summer of 1878 Louis Manigault
received the appointment of "chancelier"or chief
secretary to the Belgian consulate in Charleston,
a position which he held at least »mntil 1882.

At the end of the papers for 1882 there is a lis

 

 
Manigault, Louis 28

of all the Belgian consuls at Charleston from
1834 to 1882. There are biographical details
about Henri-Elie Lefebure, Charles Edward Stuart,
Morris Seligman, Charles Edward Wunderlick, and
Florence Thomas Downey. There is a lengthy
biographical sketch of George A. Hopley, consul
from 1840 to 1859. There are also commissions

 

appointing Downey and Seligman to their posi-
tions. In 1881 and 1882 there are copies

of letters from the Belgian Consul relating
to his efforts to collect bonds due Messieurs
Bouquillon and Waterkeyn of Auvers, Belgium,
by the Greenville and Columbia Rail-

 
Manigault, Louis 29

 

road which was in receivership.

Social life and customs in South Carolina
and Georgia after 1865 are discussed frequently
in the postwar letters. In addition a letter of
July 30, 1868, describes the murder of William
Hopkins, son of a well known radical in Savannah
Ga. A-letter of the following Sept. 9 relates
how a pack*of Negroes near Savannah had killed

a white man to procure his rifle. The same
letter tells of "Nigger Bradly" who proclaimed
in recent speeches that someday whites would not

be allowed to sit in the Georgia legislature.

 
Manigault, Louis 30

 

A letter of Nov. 10 reveals that Bradly had
fied to the North in fear of his life. A letter
of Oct. 20, 1868, relates the activities of
Democrats in Brunswick, Ga., to recruit Negro
voters. The possibility of using Chinese labor
on plantations is discussed in a letter of Aug.
18, 1869. On Dec. 13, 1872,an Englishman states
his opinions on Reconstruction, civil rights,
President Grant, and the Negro's place in U. S.
society and politics. A letter of Nov. 29,
1875, discusses the disadvantages of working a

plantation on the wage system. Share cropping

Scattered throughout the antebellum period
are letters to Louis Manigault describing the
activities of Delta Beta Phi fraternity at Yale
College of which Manigault was a founding member.

1859, at the Female School of Bennettsville,

Charles Mann was an artillery officer
during the Civil War from Missouri. In
January, 1862, he was Captain of Mann's
Battery in the Artillery of the Missouri

Volunteers. By July, he was in the Army of
the Tennessee, where he remained at least until

October, 1863. During this time, he was first
in the 4th Division, 2nd Missouri Battery.
Later he was in the lst Missouri Light
Artillery, Battery C, which was variously a

 
Mann, Charles 2
part of the 2nd Division; the 6th Division,
2nd Brigade; and the lst Division. In Novem-
ber, 1862, Mann was exchanged as a prisoner.
Promoted to major and moved to the Department
of the Cumberland, he was in charge of the
Artillery in the lst Division by May, 1864.

 

In the fall he was back in the Department of
the Tennessee as Assistant Chief of Artillery
(later Acting Chief), lst Missouri Light
Artillery, 16th Army Corps. Then he served as

officer in charge of the artillery at

 
Mann, Charles 3
Vicksburg for about a month. In late 1864
and in 1865, Mann was Assistant Chief of
Artillery, Headquarters of the Department of
the Mississippi.

The volume is a letter book containing
copies of correspondence, 1864-1865, sent by

 

Mann in his capacity as Assistant Chief of
Artillery. There are several letters addressed
to Brigadier General James Totten, Chief of
Artillery for the Military Division of West

Mississippi, often for the purpose of

 
Mann, Charles 4
forwarding reports. Other letters, primarily
to artillery officers, concern assignment of
men, tactics, promotions reports, drills,
horses, and detached officers and soldiers. A
letter of January 10, 1865, described the
“disposition of the Light Batteries of the

 

Post and the Defenses of Memphis in event of
attack."

The remainder of the book contains copies
of poetry, both signed and unsigned. It is
religious, descriptive, and political in

 
Mann, Charles p)

 

nature. Two poems in the latter category are

three dollars. He sent this money home by the
Adams Express Co., and he in turn received
through that co. some articles from home. He

remained in camps in Ky. until early in 1862
when his regiment moved to Nashville. He en-
gaged in the Battle of Shiloh, but when he wrot
of that battle he was concerned Mainly with the
large numbers who had been killed. He engaged

in the Battle of Corinth and wrote of the pre-
parations for the battle and the battle itself.
From Corinth he moved to . Huntsville, Ala.,
and thence to Tenn. From Tenn. he went to
camps near Lebanon and Bowling Green, Ky., but
he was soon (Nov., 1862) back in camp near Nash
ville. He occasionally mentions hardships, but

 

it appears from the letters that he was not in
much fighting and he was rather well supplied,
He wrote home for clothes, boots, which his
father made, food, whiskey, and tobacco. Some
of these items his father sent him a surplus of

These diaries are part of the Grissom collec-
tion, Thomas Mann was born in Amherst Co., Va.,
April 1, 1769. At 26 years of age he identified
himself with the Methodist Episcopal Church and
served as a circuit rider, except for a brief per

 

lod while sick, until his death on June 22, 1830
He professed sanctification, He served in the

been in the

 
MANN, Thomes Sketch, (2)
These seven volumes are written in crowded,
crabbed handwriting and the spelling is very poo}

The contents are concerned with Thomas Mann's
preaching as a circuit rider in N. C. The main
value lies in the light cast on the more or legs
humble origins of the Methodist Episcopal Church
There is little information contained in the jou
rnals other than Mann's travels,

The recataloging of Oct. 25, 1974, consists of
the addition of the information in the following
paragraphs and of the correction of the dates for

 

 
Mann, Thomas
three of the volumes.

There is a brief obituary and character
sketch of Mann in the Minutes of the Methodist
Conferences Annually Held in America for 1831.

Although the journals extend in time from
1805 to 1830, there are many gaps in the record,
including one of eleven years (1817-1827). Mann

 

 

preached in various circuits of the Virginia
Conference, which in that era was made up of
both Virginia and North Carolina. The seven

journals show Mann to have been a preacher in a

 
Mann, Thomas 4
wide variety of places in Virginia and North
Carolina.

The first journal covers the period April 7,

1805, through January 26, 1808. From April,
1805, to about February, 1806, Mann was Pre-
siding Elder for the entire Salisbury (N. C.)
District. He then spent a year on the Caswell
Circuit,which included parts of both North Caro-
lina and Virginia. Then from February, 1807,
until the journal's end in January, 1808, he

was assigned to the Orange (Va.) Circuit.

 

 
Mann, Thomas 5

 

The second volume of Mann's journals covers
the period April 10, 1810,to March 1, 1811.
Almost all of this time he spent on the Sussex
(Va.) Circuit. In February, 1811, he was as-
signed to the Amherst (Va.) Circuit, and the
journal may contain a few entries from this

period.
The third journal covers October 11, 1812, to

March 16, 1814, the vast majority of which time
Mann was on the Haw River (N. C.) Circuit. In

February, 1814, he was transferred to the

 
Mann, Thomas 6
Newbern, New River and Beaufort (N. C.) Circuit.
The fourth volume covers the period March 17,
1814, to March 20, 1815. During this time Mann
continued on the Newbern, New River and Beaufort
Circuit until February, 1815, when hewas moved

for the coming year to the Salisbury (N. C.)
Circuit.

 

The fifth journal covers June 11 through
December 31, 1816, during all of which time Mann
served on the Greensville (Va.) Circuit.

The sixth journal picks up Mann's career in

 
Mann, Thomas /

January 1, 1828, and continues to January 27,
1829. Until February, 1828, Mann was assigned
to the Guilford (N. C.) Circuit, and at that
time he was put on the list of the"superannuated
or worn-out preachers" for the time covered in
the remainder of this volume.

The final journal from the Mann Collection
includes the period November 10, 1829 to May 19,

 

1830. Mann was on the Amelia (Va.) Circuit un-
til February, 1830, at which time he was again
placed among the worn-out preachers.

Mann died in 1831 at the age of sixty-two,

 
Mann, Thomas 8

 

having been a travelling preacher for thirty-
five years, of which about nine years are cov-
ered by the seven journals in this collection.

this collection relate to Marbury's duties
while in office.

In a letter of Dec. 5, 1799, James Jones

noted the activities of Congress. Joseph
Clay wrote to Marbury on Apr. 2, 1802, to
ask for information concerning the ownership
of land in Columbia Co., Georgia. A third

 
Marbury, Horatio z

letter was written on Jan. 17, 1803, by David

B. Mitchell to thank Marbury for sending him

a copy of an act passed by the Ga. legislature.
The three documents in this collection are

an appointment of William Bellinger Bulloch

as attorney general of Ga. (Nov. 23, 1801), a

letter testimentary by John Milledge, Jr.

 

for Marbury as secretary of state (Dec. 8,
1803), and an extract of a deed from a record
book (Dec. 7, 1807). The document signed by
Milledge was transferred from the Milledge
Papers when they were recataloged.

Alexander John Gaspard Marcet (1770-1832),
physician and chemist from Geneva, Switzerland,
studied at the University of Edinburg and set-
tled in Londonlin 1799, evidently a refugee. He
became attached to Guy's Hospital as lecturer
in chemistry about 1800 and to the military

hospital at Portsmouth in 1809 to care for the
invalids from Walcheren. Dr. Marcet married
Jane Haldimand, the daughter of a wealthy Swiis
merchant settled in London. His papers consist
of a series of = Yello (1774-

io

1842), Thomas Young (1773-1829), Sir Charles
Blagden (1743-1820), and Sir Henry Holland (1788
1873). The tiedical and scientific world of his
day--the Napoleonic Era and the Regency in
England--are reflected in these papers. The
relations between the medical profession in
England and on the continent reveal a deep

 

interest in the physical sciences.

The letters begin in 1802 with Marcet at
Guy's Hospital. John Yelloly, the Scottish
physician, who came to London in 1800, refers
to Marcet's success at Guy's Hospital. He writes

 
Marcet, Alexander John Gaspard 3
of Mrs.’ Marcet's books in Dec. of 1803. (Jane
Marcet wrote many books of a simple scientific
character for young ladies. They enjoyed great
popularity in England and the United States). In
1805 Yelloly not only marries, but is co-founder
of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society
with Dr. Marcet. His letters make frequent

 

reference to "the Society," its meetings, hours,
and transactions. Marcet and Yelloly were also
interested in a young physician named Berger,
who was trying to secure a position in the Army
Surgical Department or With the Fast India

 
Marcet, Alexander John Gaspard
Company. This man, like Marcet, was presu-
mably a Swiss refugee.

The Yélloly letters generally refleét condi-
tions in the London medical profession between
1802 and 1818, commenting on personalities, -
publications, patients, ehemistry, medical
societies, and appointments. Both Marcet and

 

Yelloly were members of the Geological Society
of London, (founded 1807), and refer to its
affairs. By 1813, the Royal Med. and Chtrur.
Soc. had applied to the Prince Regent for a
Charter, a proceeding to which the Royal College

 
Marcet, Alexander John Gaspard 5
of Physicians objected. The Royal Society
continued to issue its publications. On Feb. 22,
1814, Yelloly describes the legal counsel arra-
yed by the two bodies of physicians in a hearing
on the charter before the Council (Privy Counci
On Jan. 11, 1814, Yelloly rejoices to Marcet
on the "liberation" of Geneva from French contrd

 

Yelloly was secretary of the Royal Med. and
Chirur. Soc., and as suchwas very influential
in building up its large and fine library, to
which he refers on Nov. 23, 1816.

Dr. Marcet returned to Geneva in 1818, and on

 
Marcet, Alexander John Gaspard 6

 

May 4, 1820, Yelloly refers to his election to
"the representative body" of the Swiss Republic
and as one of the professors at the University
of Geneva. Again there is news of the Royal
Med. and Chirur. Soc. The concluding letters
concern the members of the Marcet family.
Yelloly wrote to Mrs. Marcet on June 26, 1823,
after the death ofwher husband.

Scientists and physicians whose names enter
the Yelloly letters are! Mathew Baile, William
Saunders, Dr. Cooper, Sir Gilbert Blane, Peter
Mark Roget, Sir Joseph, Banks, Dr. Bostock,

Pierre Prevost, the physicist, et al.

Thomas Young (1773-1829), remarkable English
pioneer in ophthalmology and learned and versa-
tile translator of the hiereglyphics of the Ros-
etti stone, began a series of letters in May 18
He was concerned with a paper: by French physicist
Pierre Prevost (1751-1839), and with his being
made a member of the Royal Society. In 1805
Young refused to help organize the Royal Medical
and Chirurgical Society because he was too
pressed with work. The work of Prevost on the
doctrine of the interchange of heat receives

 

 
Marcet, Alexander John Gaspard 8
comment in Sept. 1807, when Young writes of how
papers,are presented before the Royal Society.
He mentions Dr. Berger, who had appeared in the
Yelloly letters. In Feb. of 1814 he explains
how no person born an alien may fill College
(Royal College of Physicians?) offices. Hig
letter of Dec. 1814, speaks of the work of Dr.

 

William Charles Wells. This was presumably
Wells' Essay on Dew, published in thatlear.

The letters from Sir Charles Blagden (1748-
1820), concern sending letters and parcels to
France in 1804 and 1805, Blagden advises Marcet

 

 
Marcet, Alexander John Gaspard

as to how to get Pierre Prevost, the French
physicist, a foreign membership in the Royal
Society of London. In 1804-1805 he is trying to
secure information about Benjamin Thomson,

Count Rumford, the American Physicist. Rumor
has spreai that Rumford is to marry Mme, Lavoisier
Blagden wishes to know what experiments Rumford

 

is making in Paris. He specially wants to know
if Rumford is working on heat, the field in whi
Pierre Prevostwas working. As early as 1775
Blagden had published a paper, "Experiments and
observations in an heated room," in the trans-

 
Marcet, Alexander John Gaspard 10
action of the R oyal Society, making the first
demonstration of the importance of perspiration
in the maintenance of constant body temperature,
References to Sir Joseph Banks in these letters
show that he was a close friend of Blagden.

In 1816 Bladgen writes concerning the illness
in London of a relative of Count Berthollet,
distinguished French chemist who befriended
foreign scientists in Paris.

The letters of Sir Henry Holland (1788-1873)
traveller, writer, and physician to Princess
Charlotte and to Queen V ictoria, began to Dr.

 

 
Marcet, Alexander John Gaspard 11
Marcet when Holland was a young medical student.
He evidently worked at Guy's Hospital, on which
staff Marcet served for many years. Young
Holland, while studying at Edinburgh, writes to
ask about the use of elaterium in dropsy cases
at Guy's a few years previous to 1809. By 1814
Dr. Holland has been appointed physician to
Charlotte, Princess of Wales, as she makes a
European tour. Writing from Naples he describes
the Alps, particularly the "road of the Simplon"
On which he travelled from Geneva. In Marcet's
home city he finds Pierre Prevost and Dr. Berger

 

 
Marcet, Alexander John Gaspard 12
(tientioned frequently in other letters in these
papers) among the scientific and medical circles
After reference to the German courts and to the
French garrison at Strassbourg, young Holland
describes the visit of Charlotte to exiled
Empress Marie Louis, wife of Napolean Bonaparte.
Going on to Milan, he finds a large scientific

 

group, including Brocchi and Brisloe, living
under Austrian rule. The English are popular;
Princéss Charlotte is well received everywhere.
In Florence and in Rome Henry Holland meets Sir
Humphry and Lady Davy. Sir Humphry had been

determining the type of a natural gas. The
society of Rome includes the Lucien Bonaparte
family, Sculptor Antoine Canova, and Cardinals
Fisch and Rufo, Here the art treasures amaze
Holland. In Naples the Princess settles for
six months amid a dirth of scientific and
literary men and the very formal court of King
Joachim. The remaining notes are mostly inciden-
tal, mentioning Drs. Thomas Young and Nisbitt.

An anonymous letter of 1807 warns Dr. Marcet
he is not using the most effective method to
secure a post at London Hospital.

Marcom, James Calvin. Diary, July 15, 1862 -
Aug. 18, 1863. Raleigh, Wake Co., N.C.

 

James Calvin Marcom (1827-1905) was a native
of Raleigh, North Carolina, who kept a diary
while serving at Camp Holmes near that city for
a year during 1862-1863. He was a printer by
trade, and he writes that he knew the men in
the office of the Raleigh Standard and approved

of the appointment of William Woods Holden as
State printer in 1862. He also relates that he
brought out a printing press from Raleigh, set
it up at the camp, and began printing camp

documents.

 
Marcom, James Calvin 2

 

Marcom was only four feet tall. He married
Mariah Grady on Jan. 8, 1848. A devoted member
of the First Baptist Church, he often walked
into town to attend preaching or conduct his
Sunday School class. His diary also comments
on the services held by the chaplain at Camp
Holmes. Raleigh city directories list him in

the grocery and commission business in 1880 in
a brief partnership with James H. Alford. By
1896 he was a justice of the peace as well as a
grocer, and by 1901 he was listed as public

administrator and justice of the peace in Wake

 
Marcom, James Calvin 3
County. ;
Camp Holmes was established in June, 1862,
as a camp of instruction for conscripts.
Although James C. Marcom is listed in Moore's
Roster of North Carolina Troops (IV. 257) as
enlisting on July 15, 1862, it is most probable
that he was a conscript. He was assigned to

 

 

duty immediately as sergeant to the Chief
Quarter Master of the Conscript Bureau, Captain
George B. Baker.

Major Peter Mallett (1824-1907) began to

 
Marcom, James Calvin - 4
organize the N.C. Conscript Bureau in June,
1862, when he formed Camp Holmes. Mallett is
referred to numerous times by Marcom, together
with many members of his staff. Captain Baker,
Marcom's superior officer, and Major Mallett
were both from Cumberland County, as well as
from the 3rd N.C. Regiment which was formed in

 

May, 1861. General Theophilus Hunter Holmes
knew Major Mallett as a fine drill master and
disciplinarian at the beginning of the war, and
so urged his appointment to drill, subsist, and

distribute conscripts for the State of North

 
Marcom, James Calvin s
Carolina. General Holmes and Major Mallett put
into operation the Conscript Bureau.

Among the North Carolinians involved in the
organization at Camp Holmes Marcom records the
following men:

l. Captain Frank (Franz) Hahr was commandant of
the camp of instruction under Mallett.

 

2. Captain George B. Baker was Chief Quarter
Master of the Conscript Bureau distributing
clothing, tents, equipment, wood, fodder, corn,
etc.

3. lst Lieutenant James J. Speller was in

 
Marcom, James Calvin 6
charge of the Camp Guard whose Companies A,B,
C, and D became Mallett's Battalion Camp Guards
A body of 500 well trained men, the battalion
under Mallett was ordered in Dec., 1862, by
Governor Vance to fight at Kinston. Marcom
describes this action on Dec. 13, 14, 15, 21,
and 28, 1862, as well as the fine showing made
by the battalion at the funeral of General
Lawrence O'Bryan Branch in Sept., 1862.

4. On Aug. 14, 22, 1862, Marcom listed battalion
officers as the Adjutant for Company A, lst

Lieutenant Jesse R. McLean for Company B, lst

 

 
Marcom, James Calvin 7
Lieutenant James Speller for Company C, and
unfortunately no one for Company D.

The ten Congressional Districts in North
Carolina were used for enrolling conscripts.
Marcom notes that these districts poured men
into Camp Holmes in the summer of 1862. He
writes almost continuously of replacements sent

 

to Richmond to N.C. regiments, to Fort Fisher,

to Ramseur's Brigade, and to other assignments.
The conscript work was not without incidents,

as North Carolinians disliked conscription. On

June 24, 1862, Governor Clark wrote to Major

 
Marcom, James Calvin 8
Mallett to get troops, but that it was “need-
less" to call the recruits either volunteers

or conscripts. Measles and mumps raged in Camp
Holmes (Aug. 16, 1862). Conscientious objece
tors - three Dunkards - were brought into caiip.
As local groups were formed, a staff member
from Holmes (i.e. Lt. W.H. Williams, Aug. 27,

 

1862) would go out to conduct the conscripts to
Raleigh. Trouble sometimes arose, as at
Statesville (Aug. 30, 1862), when Company A. of
the Camp Guards was sent to bring in the con-
scripts. By Nov. 1, 1862, Marcom comments that

 
Marcom, James Calvin
the flow of conscripts was slow, in fact “there
is but few" to come.

Major Mallett was seriously wounded at the
Battle of Kinston in Dec., 1862. Marcom
describes the “thrill” of the men at Camp Holmeg
when Mallett is reinstated as head of the
Conscript Bureau on March 13, 1863, at the
direct intervention of Governor Vance.

By July 16, 1863, Marcom mentions that
President Davis has called for conscripts from
18 to 45 years of age.

Camp Holmes also served as a reassignment

 

 
Marcom, James Calvin 10
post for deserters, many of whom were evidently
conscripts. Marcom noted a mass (200 men)
desertion on July 28, 1862. Lts. LH. Reid and
We He Williams were sent to hunt for such men
in Aug., 1862. Mention of desertion continues
through the diary.

Occasional note of prisoners is made by

 

Marcom. -On Nov. 7, 1862, he comments on cap-
tured "Buffaloes" - white and Negro - brought
into camp. The Negroes were set to cording

wood, a task which seems to have gone on con-

tinuously.

 
Marcom, James Calvin Be
The Marcom account of Camp Holmes is that of
@ common soldier who saw rain, mud, heat, and
cold, and who had trouble with his mess.
Increasing prices for food worried him. He
transacted much routine business for Captain
George Baker, finally impressing corn. Evident
he was in charge of moving large quantities of

 

clothing from the Raleigh warehouse of the State
of North Carolina.

Marcom noted events in the lives of Colonel
Mallett and Captain Baker. The latter was

married on Apr. 15, 1863, to Miss Kate Miller

 
Marcom, James Calvin 12
in Raleigh.

Evidently the camp was full of rumors from
the battlefields. Marcom writes casually of
Chancellorsville and the death of T.J. Jackson,
but with increasing anxiety for the fate of
Vicksburg. By July 13, 1863, rumors about
Gettysburg are replaced with news of casualties
among North Carolina troops. Companies such as
the Raleigh Rifles (Co. K, 14th N.C. Vols.)
suffered heavily.

On Aug. 55 1863, Captain John McRae and Lt.
W.eC. Rencher are sent to organize a new camp of

 

 
Marcom, James Calvin 13
instruction at Morganton, together with
companies B and D of Mallett's Battalion Camp
Guards.

Marcom notes on June 20, 1863, that claims fo
damages by W. Whitaker were being assessed.
Whitaker's land had been used for the camp.

The diary ends on Aug. 18, 1863, after which
no trace of Marcom is found except in Moore's
Roster , which lists him in Co. Cc, Fifth
Battalion, N.C. State Troops. This battalion,
as Moore states, was labeled Fifth by him for
convenience. Actually it was always known as

 

 
Marcom, James Calvin 14
the Thirteenth or Starr's Battalion of Artil-
lery. Organized on Dec. 1, 1863, it was com-
posed of six batteries of light artillery. Co.
C was led by Capt. James D. Cumming, who wrote
an account of its services for Walter Clark's
North Carolina Troops (IV, 360). In May, 1864,
one section of Co. C went to the Petersburg
lines; a second section continued in North
Carolina, where it fought at Kinston and
Bentonville and retreated with Johnston's

Army to Greensboro. It is probable that James

Calvin Marcom was in this second group.

The best sources of information for this

diary are the papers of Col. Peter Mallett
(So.H.C., U.N.C.), the edition of the letters
of Governor Vance by Frontis Johnston, Moore's
Roster of North Carolina Troops, and Clark'‘s

Albany, Albany County, New York

This collection consists of letters trans-
ferred from a miscellaneous file or added at
various times. The entire collection has been
recatalogued.

The earlier letters were written to Marcy
during his service as Secretary of War. On

 

April 1, 1845, Senator Arthur P. Bagby of Ala.
wrote asking for an interview to discuss a case
pending before the War Department.

James S. Wadsworth of New York wrote on June
1845, to ask for a letter of introduction for a

 
Marcy, William Learned 2
young man going to Wisconsin to settle. Wads-
worth also commented on the Oregon boundary issue
noting that most citizens were unaware of the
nature and validity of the American territorial
claims. He suggested that a public statement
by a high ranking member of the government would
reveal the American position, especially if such
a statement were printed in the newspapers
throughout the country.

In a letter dated March 20, 1847, John J.
Crittenden asked Marcy to furnish him information
concerning the action taken against his son,

 

 
Marcy, William Learned 4
George Bibb Crittenden, for an infraction com-
mitted as an Army officer.

The remaining three letters were addressed to
Marcy while he served as Pierce's Secretary of
State. James Young Mason, Senator from Va.,
wrote on Feb. 23, 1853, criticizing Thomas Ewing
for removing Philip B. Key, II., from his post
as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia
and asking Marcy to restore Key to this vosition.

Wesley Jones wrote from Raleigh to inform
Marcy that he accepted his appointment as a mar-
shal and would complete the requirements for

 

 
Marcy, William Learned 4
his office as soon as possible (Apr. 15, 1853).

On Jan. 9, 1854, James Morrow wrote to com-
plain about the salary and quarters given to him
while he was serving as master mate to Commodore
Matthew C. Perry. Morrow also discussed trade
between the United States and China.

Isaac Marsh was mustered into the Union Army
in July, 1862. He was a member of company K of
the 34th Regiment of Iowa Infantry Volunteers
and his letters to his wife, written nearly
every day through 1863, give a detailed account

of the movements of the 34th Iowa and of the
life of the common soldier in the Union Army.
The 34th Iowa Regiment remained at Camp Lorman
in Burlington, Iowa, from July, 1862, until

 
Marsh, Isaac 2
November, 1862, then moved by river to St. Louis
and on into Helena, Arkansas. In a letter of
November 21, 1862, Isaac Marsh explains why he
volunteered for the army even though his age
would have kept him out. Letters of December,
1862, and January, 1863, describe the Union
Army's maneuvers toward Vicksburg and report

 

rumors that the 34th Iowa is being sent there.
He describes Confederate prisoners (Jan. 11,
1863), comments on the "incompetency" and
"drunkenness" of Northern generals (Jan. 18,

1863), and writes about the Texas Rangers who
are among the prisoners captured (Jan. 18).

The 34th Iowa travels up and down the Mississip-
pi throughout 1863, mostly moving prisoners
between Arkansas and St. Louis, There are
continuous rumors of orders to march to Vicks-
burg but they are never executed. Marsh hears

 

reports of encounters between Confederates and
Union forces, describes the maneuvers preparing
for an expected battle, comments on various
Union generals, including McClellan and Grant,

Eugene Marshall (1832-1919) was a farmer
and banker who grew up in Massachusetts, spent
most of his adult life in the Midwest, and
retired to a farm in Tennessee. He served as
an enlisted volunteer in Minnesota cavalry units

during the Civil War and Sioux Wars (1862-1865).
The collection consists primarily of his cor-
respondence (1847-1918) and his diary (1851-

1905), although it includes considerable other
materials - writings, clippings, pictures,

 
Marshall, Eugene _
genealogy, etc. A full discussion of the col-
lection is filed in the Inventory File.
.. A description of a reel of microfilm
of material reposited in Minnesota may be found
in the sketch of the film, An edited version
of the war years of the diary, a master's thesis
by Clark G, Reynolds, is shelved among Duke
theses,

Marshall's correspondence and diary cover
in some detail his experiences in the Civil

and Indian wars. He saw_relatively little com-
bat, but he offers detailed description of

 

 

 
Marshall, Eugene 3
events and places (Missouri, Kentucky, Tennes-
see, Alabama, Iowa, and the Dakotas) during
his military service, as he did during his
migration west and while on a steamboat trip

Eugene Marshall (1832-1919) was a volunteer
enlisted man from Minnesota who served in
cavalry units in the Civil War and the Sioux
Wars of 1862-1865. He originally enlisted in
1861 in a cavalry company raised in his home

state, but that company and two others were
ordered to combine with Lowa cavalry companies
to form a regiment eventually known as the
5th Iowa Cavalry. In early 1864, the Minnesota
companies were withdrawn and established as

began to make extensive purchases of the land
about Abbeville. He was, perhaps, buying up land
warrants from veterans of the War of the Revolut
ion or of the War of 1812. He still held land in
Missouri, which he began to seli in 1867,

The doctors main interest does not seem to
have been in his practice as a physician, althou

that he did practice. a was continually dealing

1841) while he was in college preparing for the
Ministry in the Protestant Episcopal Church.Two
of the letters are from a former student serv-
ing in Daniel's Brigade. He mentions neglect of
religion in the army, a chaplain in one regiment
who is not very capable, no furloughs are grant-
ed, even a returned prisoner denied a furlough,
and his regret at not being able to attend the
graduation of his class at the University of N.

Marshall, William B. Account Book, 1849-1899.
Aldie, Loudoun County, Virginia,

 

William B. Marshall's name is common to many
of the accounts in this volume. He apparently
lived at Aldie in Loudoun County. The town's
name is written along with the date on page
two. Four merchants are listed for Aldie in

Elliott and Nye's Virginia Directory and Busi-
ness Register for 1852 (Richmond, 1852), p. 132,
and at least three of them appear in the accounts
of this volume.

According to the accounts of the 1840's and
early 1850's, Marshall did various kinds of re-

 

 

 
Marshall, William B. 2
pair and carpentry work. He frequently repaired
the wood parts of wagons and carriages. House-
hold items and farm implements also appear in
the accounts. Marshall's accounts continue into
the late 1870's, but after the early 1850's they
are miscellaneous and more scattered chronologi-
cally. Many pages are blank.

some miscellaneous items are: a record of
the heirs of James Hixon of Loudoun County,
1856 (p. 394); a brief list of officers and men
who served in the War of 1812, one of whom was
Jacob Marshall (pp. 386-387); and the formula

and perhaps also the ‘6 records of a medici-

nal preparation in the late 1870's (pp. 61-69).
Three back pages of accounts in the 1890's may
have belonged to a relative of Marshall.

On April 19, 1852, R. H. Marshall writes
from Laurens, S. C., to her grandsons John E.
and Charles D, Marshall, and tells of her ex-
periences at their cousin's plantation at
Laurens. She describes the plan of the planta-

tion, including the main, Negro, and overseer's
houses, and the corn shucking operations by the
slaves are dealt with in detail. She feels
that Northern abolitionists have distorted

the picture of slavery ("as it exists here it is
only in name"), and that the master's burden of
caring for slaves deserves more sympathy. She

also talks about the weather and various family

This collection consists largely of letters
written from E, B. Martin to his wife, The
letters of their courtship are an exemplary
{llumination of the art of winning a Southern
Belle, but the greater importance of the

correspondence belongs to the bulk of Martins
letters describing the experiences of a pio-
neer travelling salesman in Texas from 18735 to

1884,

 
MARTIN, E. Barton

 

Though E. B. Martin was a captain in the
Confederate Army, there are no letters from him
of this period. His father wrote him a few
letters giving an account of conditions back
home in Tennessee during the war and the Refor-
mation period,

After the War Captain Martin went to Selma,
Alabama, where he became a partner in a dry
goods business, and immediately began to woo
with matrimonial intentions Miss Julia

 
' MARTIN, E. Barton 3
Glascock, daughter of John Glascock, a cotton
factor in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

 

In 1867 Martin established himself in the
commission business, dealing in all kinds of
western produce and tobaccoes and liquors. In
December of the same year, after numerous up-

sets, Julia and the Captain settled down in
Selma -- married,

In 1873, after prosperous years in Selma,
the Martins moved to Texas -- the result of a

ranch, "Martinsburg", in Gillespie County,
Texas. While taking orders for Willis and

Four children were born to the couple:
Annie, 1869; Julia, 18717; and twins, Edward
and John, 1872. Annie and Julia attended the
Tuscaloosa Female Academy in Alabama,

 

In 1884 the Captain quit travelling and in
1885 moved to his ranch where he entered the
cattle raising business.

The letters Captain Martin wrote back to

Very little is known about John Martin
before or after his career during the American
Revolution. In 1775, he represented Savannah
in the first Provincial Congress of Georgia in
July, 1775. He was a member of the Council of

Safety and later served in the militia of his
state. After a term as governor in 1782, he
was commissioned to make a treaty with the
Creek Indians. Apparently, Martin died late in

1785 or early in 1786 on a trip westward.
Biographical information is contained with his
letters published in The Georgia Historical
Quarterly, I, 4 (Dec., 1917), 289-344,

The correspondence contained in this collec-
tion was written to Martin during his term as
governor in 1782 and are letters from Anthony
Wayne. On April 22, Wayne stressed the need to
reduce the number of deserters defecting from
the regular and militia troops in Georgia. The

Martin, John Sanford. Papers, 1917-1958.
Winston-Salem, N. C.

This collection consists of the vrofessional
correspondence and other papers of John Sanford
Martin (1886-1957), editor of the Winston-Salem
(N. C.) Journal and Sentinel, 1912-1951. He
wrote under the pen name of "Santford Martin"
(See the letter of his son at the beginning of
this collection).

Martin graduated A. B. from Wake Forest
College in 1909 and remained there for a one-=-
year law course, at the end of which he was ad-
mitted to the N. C. bar. In 1917 he left his

duties with the Journa to serve for three
years as private secre ary to Governor T. W.

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 2

 

Bickett which enabled him to compile Public
Letters and Papers of Thomas Walter Bickett

* « « (Raleigh, N. C., 1923). After his
return to Winston-Salem he took an increasingly
active part in local matters, state politics,
the improvement of education in the state, and
the administration of the Baptist church in
North Carolina. A close personal friend of
Josephus Daniels, Martin battled most of his
life to "liberalize" the Democratic party

in North Carolina. The collection reflects

Martin's interests and activities.

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 3
The collection is divided into several sec-
tions: correspondence, State Boszrd of Educa-
tion Papers, speeches, newspaper clippings,
Sunday school lesson plans, printed material,
and miscellaneous papers. The papers begin
in 1917, running in bulk from 1928 to 1953.
This collection contains a wealth of infor-

 

mation on politics in N. C. and the nation

from 1928 to 1952. The papers mirror Martin's
strong attachment to the liberal wing of the
Democratic party in N. C. during the 1930's and
his increasing moderation during his final years
He was a personal friend of Josephus Daniels,

 
Martin, John Sanford 4
Governor J. M. Broughton, and Representative
R. L. Doughton, all of whom correspond regu-
larly with him. As editor he received frequent
letters from politicians, powerful and petty,
explaining their action, seeking editorial
favors, and relating political developments.
During the 1930's the papers reflect the di-
visions among N. C. Democrats, efforts to im-
plement New Deal measures in N. C., the
relationship of the party in N. C. to the
national organization, the problems of the

depression in N. C., and political rivalries

 

 
Martin, John Sanford’ 2
in Winston-Salem.

The papers contain much information about
politics in North Carolina after 1928. In
March of that year Martin polled political lead
ers of N. C. for their ideas about the possi-
bility of the Democrats nominating a Catholic
for president. Martin, not only a devout Bap-
tist but a fervent prohibitionist, was dis-

 

turbed over Al Smith. He received replies from
prominent politicians, including Senator FP. M.
Simmons and Representatives J. H. Kerr,

C. L. Abernethy, and C. M. Stedman. Most of the

 
Martin, John Sanford 6
replies emphasized Smith's views on Temperance
rather than his religion. Other letters during
this period relate to the election of 1928 in
N. C.

Among the best early political letters are
those written by Frank McNinch, Chairman of the
Federal Power Commission. On Aug. 5, 1933,
he gives his views on public and private utili-
ties, while on the following Nov. 29 he discus-
ses the increasing antipathy of Wall Street for
Roosevelt and reveals his dislike for private

utility companies. On Feb. 6, 1935, he reviews

 

 
Martin, John Sanford Z
the controversy over his confirmation as Chair-
man of the Federal Power Commission. Letters
exchanged between Martin and McNinch (March 2
and 15, 1935) relate to Senator Bailey's alleged
vindictiveness and McNinch's refusal to get
involved with Bailey.

Barly political letters relate in detail to

 

the state sales tax which the liberal Democracy
abhorred. Letters scattered throughout early
1933 pertain to the effort to prevent the
legislature from enacting a sales tax. On

Feb. 15, 1934, an officer of the N.C. Merchants?

 
Martin, John Sanford 8

 

Association states the mercantile opposition
against the tax, while on the following March
16 an official of the N. C. Department of
Revenue enunciates the argument for the tax.
On Jan. 14, 1935, Josephus Daniels claims that
the tax stultifies the New Deal, demands re-
peal, and suggests the slogan "get the money
where the money is." Other letters in 1935

(April 26 and n. a.) assert that the sales tax
exploits the poor, Other letters from 1933 to
1936 relate to this matter.

In miscellaneous political letters of this

 
Martin, John Sanford.
period, Representative R. L. Doughton registers
opposition to a federal sales tax to finance the
New Deal (May 18, 1933); a businessman defends
the Aluminum Company of America (April 3,
1935); Senator Bailey explains his vote on the
Clark amendment to the Social Security Act
(June 20, 1935); Secretary of State Hull's
religious life and moral values are explained
(Oct. 14, 1935); Josephus Daniels defends his
recent remarks about education in. Mexico (n. deg
1935); and Senator Bailey's consistent oppositio

to New Deal measures is reviewed (April 22,

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 10
1936).

The election of 1936 heightened the animosity
among the factions of N. C. Democrats. Long
before the primary in the late spring of 1936
the liberals began to plot to elect a state
government in sympathy with the national admin-
istration. As early as Jan., 1934, a movement
was afoot to nominate Martin for lieutenant
governor in 1936. Letters scattered through-
out early 1934 press him to run, but he refused.
Throughout the next two years letters from

Roosevelt Democrats express anxiety over the

 

 
Martin, John Sanford pe 3

 

power of the reactionaries in their party.

On May 3, 1935, Representative Doughton
confides that he will not run for governor be-
cause the President wants him to remain in
Washington. Early in the following year Martin
beseeches Josephus Daniels to come home and run
for the Senate against Bailey (Jan. 28, 1936);
on Feb. 3 Daniels does not give an answer,

but reaffirms his dislike of Bailey and his
machine and admits he would like to be in the
Senate. Some weeks later on Feb.23 Daniels
promises to consider the proposal, and a short
time later Telates that he is going into se-

 
Martin, John Sanford 12

 

clusion to ponder his future (March 9). A few
weeks later on March 27 he announces he will
not seek the office. In the meantime the li-
berals backed Ralph McDonald for governor, and
Martin's correspondence indicates the furious
effort to capture victory for him in the
Democratic primary. Clyde Hoey defeated
McDonald because, charges one of Martin's
friends, a large number of Republicans voted
for Hoey (June 11, 1936). M& the following
July 22 Martin reviews his career in behalf of

the liberal Democracy in N. C. Ralph

and defy the interests and wishes of most of the
state's DERGALAEE » Letters in the late summer
of 1936 pertain to Senator Bailey s attack on
the Whereis and their reaction to it (especial
ly Aug. 24). During 1936 the letters of A. J.
Fletcher, Raleigh lawyer, illustrate the ferven
desire of the liberals to remake the party
according to their own wishes. During the

@

 

 
 

Martin, John Sanford 14
winter of EES Martin tried to prompt

Drew Pearson to attack the conservatives in
N. C. (letter of Feb. 4, 1937). On Feb. 17,
1937, “artin identifies William M. Hendren,
leader of the Winston-Salem bar, as head of the
reactionary Liberty League.

The efforts of Gordon Gray and his friends

to obtain a license for a radio station il-
lustrates the deep cleavages among Democrats.
Owen Moon, a Roosevelt Democrat, owned the
Piedmont Publishing Company which not only

operated the Journal and Sentinel, but a radio

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 15

 

station as well. The conservatives fumed
because they had no public means of communi-
cation in Winston-Salem.. Representative
Doughton and Senator Reynolds sided with Moon
and Martin against Gordon Gray, who appears

to have led the effort to procure a license
(Sept. 12 and 17, 1936). Im Washinzton, Walter
Brown, free-lance writer and correspondent for
the Journal-Sentinel, and Frank MeNinch lob-
bied against Gray. On January 21, 1937,
Josephus Daniels reviews his efforts in the

capital ag@inst Gray. Despite their influence

 

 
Martin, John Sanford: 16

 

the license was granted. (See the sketch of
the restricted papers.)

In 1937 Owen Moon sold the Piedmont
Publishing Co. to Gordon Gray and his family.
The transaction, which took place only a few
months after the start of the bitter animosity
which arose over the election of 1936, shocked
Martin. On March 25, 1937, Martin enumerates
in detail why the owners will not retain him;
this letter affords an excellent insight into
local, state, and national political machina-

tions. To everyone's surprise Martin was not

 
Martin, John Sanford 7

 

deposed. Gordon Gray maintained a remdte but
firm control over editorial policy, permitting
Martinfreedom, but interferins occasionally.
On May 10, 1938, Gray criticigad a recent
editorial commending Ralph McDonald. Letters
described in the restricted sketch contain
more information on Gray's policies. Both the

restricted and unrestricted papers reveal
Martin's growing moderation and Gray's
ultimate shift from the right to center, at
least as far as editorial policy was concerned.
There are many exchanges between Martin and

 
Martin, John Sanford 18
Gray over suitable candidates, especially
Roosevelt (Aug. 15, 22, 24, 31, and n. d.,
1944); industrialist Thurmond Chatham for the
U. S. House (May 3 and 7, 1946); and Harry
Truman (Aug. 9, 1948). The 1944 letters
concerning Roosevelt indicate that Martin
persuaded Gray against his wishes to support the
national Democratic ticket.

After the acquisition of the Journal and
Sentinel by the Grays, Martin gradually
becomes less important as one of the leaders

of the liberal Democrats. The emphasis of his

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 19
papers slowly changes from politics to educa-
tion and non-political problems of the state.
He continues to attract letters from prominent
leaders, but he no longer can be reckoned an
influential editor-politician. It is after
1937 that he tecones one of the state's pre-
eminent advocates of education

Nevertheless, the papers relating to politics

 

in N. C. continue in abundance. On Feb. 4,
1938, Thurmond Chatham presents a defence of the
southern industrialist during the New Deal.

Letters of April 1 and 2, 1938, relate in de-

 
Martin, John Sanford 20

tail to the activities of the W. P. A. in the
South, especially in Winston-Salem. Senator
Bailey on July 22, 1938, reveals his nativist
views and urges that “half breed Americans"
be kept out of N. C. and the South. A letter
of Nov. 24, 1939, reviews the career of O. P.
"Kidd" Brewer to date (see also April 3, 1945).
The popularity of state senator Gordon Gray
among his Negro constituents is discussed on
April 12, 1940. An undated letter of 1940
describes the political career of J. Melville

Broughton. An enclosure to letter of Sept. 23,

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 21

 

1941, relates to the effort to procure better
judges for N. C.

Letters pertaining to national politics
during this period relate to the dearth of
leadership in the House of Representatives
because of Speaker Bankhead's illness and
John D. O'Connor's unfitness (Dec. 17, 1936);
Josephus’ Daniels' views on the "packing" of the
Supreme Court (Feb. 23, 1937); Representative
Doughton's opinions on President Roosevelt's
relationship to American tradition (April

18, 1938); the alleged activities of advertis-

 
Martin, John Sanford 22
ing agencies in behalf of Wendell L. Willkie
in 1940 (July 1, 1940); the role of powerful
businessmen and industrialists in nominating
Willkie(Oct. 24, 1940); the views of the late
R. J. Re-ynolds(1850- 1918) on the inter-relation-
ship of politics, business, and government
(Oct. 11, 1940); and the tax structure's dis-
crimination against tobacco in favor of wines
(Nov. 17, 1941).

World War II and the events leading up to
it are discussed occasionally in letters.

Surprisingly the collection displays little

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 23

 

insight into the significance of develop-
ments in Europe in the 1930's. Nevertheless,
a Jewish lawyer protests the Judenrein cam-
paign in Germany on Sept. 17, 1935. A letter
of Sept. 19, 1936, reviews recent developments
in the Soviet Union, the strength of Germany,
and the possibility of a future European war.
Dr. Walter Judd's recent activities in behalf
of international friendship with Japan are
discussed on Feb. 19, 1939. Letters on May
21 and Sept. 3, 1940, relate to William

Allen White's efforts to obtain aid for Great

 
Martin, John Sanford 24
Britain against the Nazis.

The collection contains scattered informatio
about World WarII, mainly relating to the War
effort rather than to military matters. On Dec.
13, 1941, Drew Pearson writes of the need to
arouse the nation to the danger arising from
Pearl Harbor, while on the following Feb. 10
a Federal official laments public apathy to-
ward the war effort. William Allen White
writes on March 24, 1942, of the urgent need
for the U. S. to take the offensive. Senator

Bailey explains on the following June 12 the

necessity to implement the objectives of
President Wilson in the vost-war world; he
claims that he is more of a Roosevelt
Democrat than he is given credit for.
Representative Clare Booth Luce on May 14,
1943, theorizes on the relationship of labor,
capital, and profits to the war effort.

Representative Broughton comments on the
following June 20, that after the war the
states will have to reassert their rights and
that capitalism must be modified to secure the

well being of all. A letter of Aug. 17, 1943,

 
Martin, John Sanford 26
relates to the tyve of international body
which should be established after the war.
Scattered throughout the war years are soldiers*®
letters. Filed in the letters is a "confiden-
tial" transcript (June 19, 1945) of an inter-
view with President Truman concerning future
relations with the Soviet Union and the United
Nations.

the collection contains some interesting
letters relative to politics in N. C and the
nation during World War II. For a time during
the war Martin seemed to regain some of his
former influence as an editor-politician, but

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 2?

 

eventually other interests drew him away from
politics. Representative John H. Folger,
Martin's friend, writes on Feb. 10, 1942, of

his opposition to including members of Congress
in the Federal Civil Service Retirement Svstem.
On the following April 24 Senator Bailey
solicits Martin's atd to secure his renomina-
tion. The need to establish camps for migrator

workers is reviewed on May 23, 1942. On the
following July 3 Representative Doughton dis-
cusses the need for higher inheritance and

estate taxes to finance military expenditures.

 
Martin, John Sanford 28

John Temple Graves writes on Dec. 19, 1942, of
the need to develop a two-party system in the
South not based on the racial issue. A letter
and enclosure of Feb. 14, 1943, pertain to
the Ruml plan for income tax relief. Letters
in the spring of 1943 (March 4, 16, and April
27) relate to 0. Max Gardner's debate about

 

whether to run for the Senate against R. R.
Reynolds and to the effort to get Ralph McDonald
to campaign again for governor (April 21).

Late in 1943 (Dec. 8) Representative Doughton
attacks Drew Pearson. On Jan. 24, 1944,

 
Martin, John Sanford 29
Governor Doughton requests Martin to pen edi-
torials against the haulers of non-tax paid
liquor. Letters of the following Nov. 14 and
17 argue for and against peacetime military
conscription. Letters scattered throughout
1944 give sentiment about a fourth term for
Roosevelt. &. M. Hanes, for example, on Oct.
14 states that he can no longer support the
President because of the radical elements
attracted to the administration. In the last
half of 1945 Martin received a series of letters

urging that agricultural co-operatives be

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 30

 

subject to business taxes.

Although Martin's interest in politics
decreased markedly after the war, he continued
to receive an occasional letter of value. A
prominent industrialist argues on May 10, 1946,
that the 0. P. A..must be abolished. A memoran
dum of July 16, 1946, and enclosure relate
in detail to the alleged infiltration of
communists in the American labor movement.
Governor J. Strom Thurmond's pressure on
senatorial candidate J. M. Broughton to swing
N. C. to the Dixiecrats is narrated in a letter
of July 26, 1948, while on the following

 
Martin, John Sanford 31

Sept. 2, Governor Thurmond argues why the

South must have a strong third party. A letter
of Dec. 21, 1948, reviews the accomplishments
of Governor R. Gregg Cherry's administration.
Details of the feud between President Truman
and columnist Jay Franklin are revealed on

Jan. 11, 1949. Scattered letters after the
autumn of 1949 relate to the effort to re-

 

elect Senator Graham, Martin's old friend. On
May 29, 1950, Martin professes that Smith
could not defeat Graham in a runoff primary,

but on the following July 1 credits Graham's

 
Martin, John Sanford 32

loss to the recent Supreme Court decision on
segregation. On Jan. 10, 1950, Representative
Thurmond Chatham defends himself against
charges thathe is anti-labor. Some time later
(Jan. 27, 1953) Chatham writes of the need to
let higher government officials retain their
stock holdings. A letter and enclosure of May
12, 1950, by a State Department official seeks
to discredit charges by Senator Joseph McCarthy.
On May 15, 1951, Martin explains the issues

on which he has not supported the Truman
administration. Scattered throughout the post-

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 33
war years are letters divulging information
about. the relationship of N. C. Democrats to
the national party.

The collection gives some insight into
economic and social problems in North Carolina
in the 1930's and 1940's. Martin served on
various local and state committees which are
illustrated in the collection. There is

 

considerable information about labor and eco-
nomic problems in N. C.. Followins are citations
only to the more important letters. A letter

of March 2, 1938, by the Commissioner of the

 
Martin, Jobn Sanford 34

 

N. C. Department of Labor describes efforts of
businessmen to undermine the C. I. 0. An
enclosure and letter of Feb. 9, 1938, argues
against a proposed hours and wage bill for

N. Ce. On the following pee. 1 Martin says that
the South is probably the nation's worst eco-
nomic problem and urges reform. He writes on
on Oct. 12, 1939, of the need to attract new
industry to N. C.; Thurmond Chatham's opposi-
tion, he charges, is unrealistic. Governor
Broughton argues on Feb. 19, 1942, that un-

employment compensation should be a state, not

 
Martin, John Sanford je be

a national function. Letters throughout 1941
and 1942 relate to Martin s membership on the
Southeast Regional Planning Commission. Late

in 1943 letters disclose the controversy

created by the attempts of the Cc. I. 0. to
organize Winston Salem's tobacco workers (Nov.
11, 13, 16, 23). Ome publisher of the Charlotte

 

Observer charges on Sept. 22, 1944, that
excessive state taxation is preventing indus-
tries, especially Dupont, from locating in N. C.
Governor Cherry enunciates his determination

on Oct. 20, 1945, to retire state workers at the

 
Martin, John Sanford 36
minimum age to give work to returning veterans,
On the following Nov. 19 a letter reviews the
need for improved health and accident insurance
for industrial workers in N. C. Early in 1947
letters discuss the minumum wage bill before the
N. C. legislature (Feb. 15 and March 28). In
the spring of 1949 (May 2 and 14) State Super-
intendent of Public Instruction C. A. Erwin

 

writes of the need to keep the state's college
graduates in N. C. A letter and enclosure of
Dec. 26, 1950, relate to the protests of the
Carolina Power and Light Company against tax

 
Martin, John Sanford a7

 

exemptions for publicly-owned utilities.
Other letters reflect various problems
facing N. C. On April 12, 1941, Governor
Broughton promises aid to get a road up Mount
Mitchell. A letter and enclosure of Feb. 12,
1948, relate in detail’ to poor rural roads.
Scattered letters in 1945 pertain to the ac-
tivities of the N. C. Symphony Orchestra for

which Martin served as regional director. A
letter and enclosure of March 11, 1940,
emphasize the effort to attract tourists to

N. C.,especially Charlotte. Letters of Jan.

 
Martin, John Sanford 38

 

29, 1942, and Fab. 27, 1988, relate in detail
to the treatment of the mentally ill in N. Cc.
After 1940 the collection contains an in-
creasing amount of material on racial problems
in North Carolina, especially Winston-Salem,
and the South. Martin had rather conservative
views on racial matters.The correspondence
reflects his interests. A letter of June 17,

1942, deprecates Negro leader Walter Francis
White. On Dec. 22, 1943, an official of the
Southeastern President's Conference explains
vne fair employment recommendations of the
conference. On Oct. 20, 1944, Governor

 
Martin, John Sanford 39

 

Broughton writes of the nationwide pressure on
him to obtain a fair trial for De Barry, a
Negro labor organizer who had insulted a white
woman in Winston-Salem. Conditions in Negro
districts in Winston-Salem are dealt with in
detail in an enclosure to a letter of Jan. 3,
1945. Letters scattered throughout 1947 re-
late to restrictive covenants and action of the
U. S- Supreme Court on them. There are legal
papers anc briefs on July 6, 1949, pertaining
to efforts of Negro parents in Durham, N. C.,
to integrate the city schools. Im June of 1951

 
Martin, John Sanford 4O

 

Martin published a letter from a racist who
objected to the billeting of white and Negro
soldiers in the same barracks; it provoked a
series of letters from indignant Negroes.
Governor Umstead writes to the President of
the N. C. Chapter of N. A. A. C. P. on June
24, 1954, that he upholds the State Board of
Education's decision not to integrate the
schools at present; he charges that the Negro
leaders underestimate the problem. On June
10, 1955, Governor Luther Hodges writes while
the legislature is considering the Pearsall

 
Martin, John Sanford 41
amendment that he wishes to avoid extremes on
both sides which are presging him.

Martin's correspondence reflects his life-
long interest in the Baptist Church. There
are hundreds of letters scattered throughout
the collection from ministers and laymen
about church problems and policy. In 1928

 

there are letters relating to the North
Carolina Baptist Centennial Campaign

which hoped to raise $1,500,000. On Oct. 4,
1935, President T. D. Kitchen of Wake Forest

College complains of the unfairness of A. M. A.

 
Martin, John Sanford 42
accreditation polities, especially of the Wake
Forest Medical School. Letters in 1938 and 1939
pertain to the efforts to select an editor for
the Biblical Recorder and the purchase of that
paper by the N. C. State Baptist Convention.
Finally J. C. Slemp became editor, but his edi-
torial policies proved too independent for the
Convention; it is doomed financially because
subsidies may be terminated. The maneuvers

to obtain a new editor are discussed ina
letter of July 4, 1942; the trustees ina

recent secret meeting voted almost unanimously

 

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 43

to invite hoyt Blackwell to become editor, but
he rejected the proposal. Other letters give
limited insight into the operation of Campbell
College for which Martin served as a member of
the board of trustees. On June 4, 1946, Martin
is told in confidence that he has been nomi-
nated and approved as a trustee of Wake Forest,
but for unknown reasons the appointment never
materialized. Other letters relate to the
Bowman Gray School of Medicine (April 2, 1946,
and Oct. 3, 1947) and the N. C. Baptist Hospita

for which Martin served as trustee. On Dec. 15%

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 4b

1949, Representative C. B. Dean urges Wake
Forest to apply for all funds possible under the
Hill-Burton Act to improve its medical school.
Letters of the following year contain in-
formation about the efforts of F. 0. Mixon

to prevent Bowman Gray from accepting
government funds (Jan. 6, Jan. 7, Feb. 3, and
May 10, 1950). Of special interest is a letter
from the Dean of Bowman Gray to Mixon (Jan. 7,
1950) in which he recounts a recent conference
with Mixon. There is some information of the

Pad

endowment of Wake Forest College by the

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 45

Ze Smith Reynolds Foundation in the papers
after 1946. A letter and enclosure of March 20,
1946, narrate the conditions under which Wake
Forest would accept the money. A letter of the
following June 27 indicates that some Baptists
believe there might be some hidden facets to the
offer. Ensuing letters pertain to the drive to
raise funds to facilitate the college's
relocation in Winston-Salem. Im addition the
collection contains scores of letters relating
to matters of less moment for Baptists: the

finances of individual churches; growth of the

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 46

 

denomination; problems of the ministry, etc.
There are two boxes of lesson plans for a
Sunday school which Martin taught most of his
life.

The collection mirrors Martin's efforts to
preserve prohibition in N. C. Beginning in
1932 and running periodically throughout the
collection are letters from “drys. An undated
item in the letters for 1932 interprets the
primary election returns in terms of sentiment
for and against prohibition. In 1933 letters

protest against the repeal of the 18th Amend-
ment, especially to Martin's activities.

 
Martin, John Sanford 4?
Throughout the 1930's are letters from Cale
Burgess, president of the United Dry Forces of
N.- C. An interesting letter of June 21, 1938,
illustrates how any compromise with the "wets"
by a N. C. politician automatically alienated
many temperance voters. Mrs. Bess Hoey, the
Governor's wife, writes on Feb. 29, 1940, of
her fervent temperance views. A letter of Jan.
31, 1941, gives a lucid discussion of the
prohibition campaign of recent ye2rs. During
the Alcoholic Beverage Control fight in
Forsyth County in 1949 Martin attracted up-
wards of 150 letters from the "drys." In the

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 48

 

Journal he published signed editorials for con-
tinued vrohibition, while his associate, A. G.
Ivey, penned favorable editorials for the
Sentinel. This situation prompted Time
magazine on Sept. 12, 1949, to write a short
feature on “artin. Another A. B. C. campaign
in 1951 evoked a lesser response from th

prohibitionists, perhaps accounting for the vic
tory of the advocates of state liquor stores.
After the election Martin charged (July 21,
1951) that the liquor lobby and white poli-
ticians controlled the Negro vote, thereby

 
Martin, John Sanford 4g

 

overwnelming the white peoples'desire for
continued prohibition.

The papers relating to education constitute
perhaps the most significant aspect of the
collection. After 1932 the papers reflect
Martin's untiring efforts to improve public
primary and secondary education in N. C.
Hundreds of school administrators and teachers
wrote to him of their problems which he
patiently considered in return letters. Each
spring usually brought scores of invitations to

speak at commencement exercises. The papers

 
Martin, John Sanford :

relate in detail to problems of education in the
state: the drive to tighten the compulsory at-
tendance law, pressure on the legislature during
the depression not to lower educational appro-
priations, efforts to procure a nine-month
school term, higher salaries for teachers,
lighter teaching loads, teacher education and
certification, vocational education, the prob-
lems of education during World War II, efforts
to improve educational opportunities for
Negroes, consolidation of high schools,

Federal aid to education, and integration of

 

 
Martin, John Sanford be

the schools in N. C. Martin's extensive corres-
pondence with C. A. Erwin, F. P. Graham, and

B. B. Dougherty reveals them as a quartet dedi-
cated to improve education. After Martin's
friend J. M. Broughton became governor in 1941,
he was appointed to the state Board of
Education, a position which he held until short

 

ly before his death in 1957. After his appoint

ment the papers reveal Martin's participation

in high level decisions pertaining to education.
During the 1930's the collection portrays the

efforts of educators to procure sufficient

 
Martin, John Sanford ‘52

 

funds for schools, to prevent a shorter school
term,and to obtain compulsory attendance laws.
In an undated letter for 1935 Josephus Daniels
discusses the need for N. C. to promote better
schools rather than to build roads; he urges
Martin to unite with Jonathan Daniels to in-
fluence the legislature. A letter of March 8,
1935, narrates the efforts to push a textbook
rental bill through the legislature. A member
of the State School Commission on June 6,
1339, defends the per capita educational
expenses for N. C. and claims it can not be
compared fairly with the northern states. A

 
Martin, John Sanford

 

53

state representative asserts (April 28, 1940)
that a witch hunt is not needed at U. N. C.,
while a letter of the following June 11 ex-
coriates President F. P. Graham's radicalism.
On Dec. 11, 1940, a letter and enclosure éis-
close information about the movement to estab-
lish the “Inter-American Institute of the Uni-
versity of North Carolina." Governor Broughton

comments in detail on his school program on
Feb. 17, 1941. On Aug. 4, 1942, he reveals
his plan to appoint Negroes to the governing
boards of purely Negro institutions. On the

 
Martin, John Sanford 54
following Sept. 21 he affirms that ultimately
N. C. should have a nine-month school term
despite a shortage of money and opposition in
rural areas.

After 1942 letters pertain to the wartime
and postwar problems of education. State
Superintendent of Public Instruction Cc. A.

 

Erwin professes on Jan. 12, 1943, that unless
teachers receive higher salaries a shortage will
ensue; Josephus Daniels registers the same
opinion two days later. Other commimications

from school administrators at this time &ssert

 
Martin, John Sanford 55s

 

the same thing. There are minutes of a sub-
committee of the State Board of Education
studying Negro education ( Feb. 24, 1944),

and a letter and enclosure of Sept. 11, 1945,
review efforts to give better schools to Ne-
groes. A: letter and memorandum of Feb. 12,
1947, enumerate’ the ratio of state and iocal
funds expended in all counties for education.

Letters late in 1947 evolve around charges
that Republican teachers in Yadkin County
were fired because of their political af-

filiations. A letter of Jan. 7, 1948, narrates

 
Martin, John Sanfora 56
the economic problems of Negro teachers, the |
high costs of summer school for them, and the
limited facilities for graduate training. Let-
ters of the following Jan. 12 and Feb. 28 tell
of the large number of one-room schools still
left in N. C. and of recent building programs
across the state. The drive to consolidate
high schools is discussed in many letters,

 

especially Jan. 6, 1950, and Dec. 6, 1951.
An undated letter and enclosure of 1952
argue for Federal aid to southern schools.

The letters cited above are only better

 
Martin, John Sanford 4

samples from the collection--hundreds of others
reflect many aspects of education in N. C.
“There are letters scattered through the
collection from southern journalists and edi-
tors. They relate to the problems of news-
paper publishing and journalistic matters,

some of which are of little moment. There are,

 

however, some unusual letters. Josephus
Daniels discusses the ethics and practicality
of newspaper monopolies in smaller cities and
the government's current antitrust suit

against the Associated Press, while on Nov. 10,

 
Martin, John Sanford 58

 

1943, Gerald W. Johnson writes that he has
resigned from the Baltimore Sun staff and that
H. L. Mencken has predicted his retirement will
not last more than six months. In tlemis-
cellaneous papers there is a short history

of journalism in N. C. which may have been
written by William Woods Holden.

“At the end of the collection there are three
boxes of papers, mainly mimeograph reproduc-'
tions, collected by Martin during his tenure on
the State Board of Education. Two boxes con-

tain minutes of the Board, 1943-1953. The

 
Martin, John Sanford 59

 

third box contains miscellaneous reports,
memoranda,. etc. pertaining to school finance,
1950 lawsuit to integrate the Durham city
schools, various bills pending in the legis-
lature, lunch programs, vocational education,
high school curricula, shortages of teachers,
student loans, teacher certification and
salaries, building programs, private business

schools, and the State Textbook Commission.
At the end of the collection there are
three boxes of printed material. Two boxes

consist of approximately fifty pamphlets and

 
Martin, John Sanford 60

 

other printed matter relating to temperance,
the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Wake Forest
College, the Baptists in N. C., politics in

N. C. and the U. S., especially to the move-
ment to prevent Al Smith's nomination in 1928,
and professional journalistic societies. An-
other box contains newspaper clippings relating

to state and national politics after 1932.
There are many clippings, especially from the
Chicago Tribune, pertaining to the 1952
nominating conventions. In addition there

are clipped editorials by Martin from his later

 

 
Martin, John Sanford 61
years as editor. The collection terminates
with three boxes of Martin's speeches, in
outline form, covering all aspects of his
career.

ReSTPRECPED PORTION (Resreicrions Removed, 1/990, PIS:
The collection céntains one box*of restrict-
ed papers relating mainly to Martin's financial
affairs and the purchase of the Journal and
sentinel by the Gray family. There are two
personal letters from Martin's father, papers

pertaining to the estate of Paschal Poole for
which Martin served as administrator, a letter
of March 13, 1935, enunciating the deplorable

papers, and papers relating to Martin's salary
and retirement.

The most valuable papers in the restricted
category evolve around the election of 1936
and the purchase of the Journal and Sentinel

by the Grays. Owen Moon, the owner,writes in
1936 (date incomplete) that he will not sell
the newspapers to the Grays whom, he charges,
covet political power. Moon and Martin had

maintained an avid pro-Roosevelt policy in

 
Martin, John Sanfora ama

 

the Journal and Sentinel. Martin believed
that the Grays would stultify a New Deal in

Ne C. On July 17, Martin writes that the
primary defeat of liberal Democrat Ralph
McDonald in the gubernatorial race illustrates
the need to abolish absentee voting. Martin

seeks the aid of Representative R. L.

Doughton (Sept. 14, 1936) to prevent the Grays

and the "Liberty League" from procuring a
license to establish a radio station. Martin

later recruits the help of Josephus Daniels

 
RESTRICTED
Martin, John Sanford 65

 

and Senator R.. R. Reynolds ( Jan. 1, 6, and 30,
1937). Moon, however, sold the newspapers to
the Grays, and a memorandum of 1937 (date
incomplete) by the Gray's agent, W. K. Hoyt,
announces that the Journal and Sentinel will
hereafter be independent Democratic newspapers.
(See the complete sketch of the collection for
other details of this period.)

The Grays retained Martin as editor. In
1937 (date incomplete) he outlines problems

facing the Journal and Sentinel. By 1939

 
RESPRICTED
Martin, John Sanford 66

 

it appears an atmosphere of mutual respect and
good will had developed between Martin and
Gordon Gray, the principal owner (see letter of
Dec. 28, 1939). On May 30, 1940, Martin writes
to his friend Governor Broughton that it was
all he could do to keep the newspapers neutral

Guring the primary because of Gray's antipathy
for Broughton. On the following July 22 Gray
writes Martin that editorial policies must be
modified in keeping with the owner's views.

A letter of Aug. 23, 1944, indicates that Marti

 
=RESTRICTED
Martin, John Sanford 67

 

had dissuaded Gray from supporting Dewey for
President.

The restricted papers, when used in conjunc-
tion with the regular part of the collection,
illustrate the crisis in the Democratic Party i
1936 occasioned by deep animosities between the
liberal and conservative factions and its im-
pact on local politics. After 1937 the restric
ted papers and the regular collection reveal
Martin's growing moderation and Gordon Gray's
gradual shift from the political right to

Born in Atexandria, Virginia, on July 26,
1882, Lucy Randolph Mason was the daughter of
Rev. Landon Randolph and Lucy (Ambler) Mason. .

Among her ancestors were some of the most
prominent names in Virginia history. Her

parents instilled in her an active interest in
social problems, and she devoted her long life
to improving the lot of factory-workers, women,
and Negroes. Never attending college, Miss

 
Mason, Lucy Randolph

 

Mason taught herself stenography and typing,
went to work in a Richmond law office, and
became active in the Richmond Equal Suffrage
League and the League of Women Voters. She
served as industrial secretary of the Richmond
Young Women's Christian Association from 1914

to 1918 and as its general secretary from 1923
to 1932. In 1931 she was employed for two
months by the National Consumers' League to
work with the Southern Council on Women and
Children in Industry in an attempt to create

 
Mason; Lucy Randolph

more favorable public attitudes toward child
labor legislation and restrictions on working
hours for women and children in factories.

From 1932 to 1937 Miss Mason was general
secretary of the National Consumers' League,

an organization concerned with wages and working
conditions,

 

In 1937, after an interview with John L.
Lewis, president of the Congress of Industrial
Organizations, Miss Mason decided to move to

Atlanta and assume the post of C.I1.0. public

 
Mason, Lucy Randolph au 4
relations representative for the Southeast.
Until her retirement sevéteen years later she
was the C,I.0.'s spokes in the South. Her
duties were never clearly defined, however,

and she interpreted her responsibilities
broadly. She visited communities where C.I.0.
unions were attempting to organize workers and

 

tried to win public support. When strikes
were called she presented the case for labor
to the usually hostile town. More importantly,
Miss Mason traveled extensively in behalf of

 
Mason, Lucy Randolph 5
labor, attended many college conferences, made
speeches, wrote articles, and carried on a
large correspondence with manufacturers,
newspapermen, labor leaders, churchmen, and
politicians. ;

Shortly before retiring in 1954 at the age
of 72, Miss Mason published To Win These Rights,

 

(New York: Harper and Brothers, 1952), an
autobiographical account of her years with the
C.I.0, She died in 1959,

This collection is composed of correspon-
dence, speeches, memoranda, miscellany, printed

 
Mason, Lucy Randolph 6
material, clippings, and four volumes. Almost
none of it is personal.

For the period before 1937 the correspondence
is largely concerned with Miss Mason's work
with the Richmond League of Women Voters. There
is much material relating to her southern
tour in 1931 but very little on the Y.W.C.A.
in Richmond and none at all on the National
Consumers' League (1932-1937). Beginning in
1937 the correspondence, both incoming and out-
going, is extensive. Most of it deals with

 

 
Mason, Lucy Randolph

 

C,1.0, unions, strikes, and wages, hours,

and working conditions in various southern
industries. Among other topics mentioned fre-
quently are the American Federation of Labor
and its competition with the C.1I.0., the
Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tenn.,
the Southern School for Workers in Richmond,

the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, the
Southern Regional Council, and the Southern
Conference Education Fund, There is also
material on the Political Action Committee of

 
Mason, Lucy Randolph 8
the C.1.0., the Roosevelt administrations,
penal reform, and Georgia politics and govern-
ment, especially the gubernatorial campaign of
1946. Miss Mason paid particular attention to
the attitudes of churches toward labor unions,
and her letters reflect her interest in winning
the support of ministers and church groups.

She spent much time and effort in trying to
mitigate the prejudice against Negroes, who
made up a sizable proportion of C,I.0. union
membership in the South, Among her correspon-
dents were Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jonathan

 

 
Mason, Lucy Randolph 9
Daniels, John Llewellyn Lewis, George Sinclair
Mitchell, Sidney Hillman, and Philip Murray.
She submitted detailed monthly reports of her
activities to Allan S. Haywood, director of
organization for the C,I.0.

There is one box of speeches and notes for
speeches, most of them by Miss Mason, but
several are by Henry A. Wallace. The collection
includes notes and the typescript of her book,
Zo Win These Rights. Minutes, memoranda,
and miscellany are filed together and are

 

 

 
Mason, Lucy Randolph 10
concerned largely with Miss Mason*s union
activities and philanthropic interests. Two
boxes of printed material include publications
of the C.1I.0., the Federal Council of Churches,
the Southern Regional Council, the Southern
Conference Education Fund, and the National
Religious and Labor Fund. There are also six

 

boxes of clippings, arranged by decades,
dealing with labor unions, Georgia politics,
and the administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt

and Harry S. Truman,

after 1850, letters to prancis Mason from his

especially valuable, containing many references
to family affairs, farming operations, and the
Loudoun County estate owned by her husband and
Richard H. Henderson, with comments on the diffi
culties of travel between her home, "Culross,"
near Alexandria, Virginia, and "Eagle's Rest," i

 

Loudoun Co., Va. Included also are letters from
James Barbour, John J. Crittenden, John K.

letter from Carry Mason, daughter of Elizabeth

John Smith, “an exceedingly clever young

man" in the Quartermaster Department at Car-

lisle Barracks in 1792 writes aletter to Col.

Ephraim Blaine (1741-1604) concerning Revolu-

tionary War accounts of Col. John Davis. Davis

 

papers had been found in a desk of Capt. Wil-
liam: Holmes, also evidently at Carlisle. The
accounts of the Continental Army were either
being settled or charges were being brought
against Davis. The papers concerning the
purchase of horses are from the period when
General Thomas Mirtli@® was Quartermaster-

General of the army. The other manuscripts

show Col. Davis receiving from General Nathan-
acl Greeny, Quartermaster-Genera} 17768-1781,
large sums of money for purchases. William
Nichols (1754-1804), also involved with Davis
in the settlement of accounts, was Quarter-

master of the 6th Pennsylvania Battalion till
1778, when he resigned, presumably to become
a deputy under Greencin the same capacity in
which Davis was serving. During the Revolu-
tion Colonel Ephraim Blaine was Commissary-
General of Purchases for the Continental Army.

are twenty-eight letters written mostly in
French by Anne Butler during the 1850's.

She lived in Dublin and described some aspects
of its social and cultural life. She discussed
a variety of persons, subjects, and events of
interest to an educated young lady of the
aristocracy. Notable topics include: Mr.
Glennon, a taxidermist who specialized in

birds (July 23, 1852, and Oct. 20, 1856) -
probably Richard Glennon who published articles
on fossil deer in 1847; an exhibition by

George Mathews was born in Augusta County,
Virginia in 1739 and died in Augusta, Georgia,
Aug. 30,1812. He led a volunteer company
against the Indians at the age of twenty-two,
took part in the battle of Point Pleasant, Oct.
10,1774, and at the beginning of the Revolution

was Dlaced in command of the 9th Virginia
regiment. He was engaged at Brandywine and
Germantown where he received nine bayonet wounds
and was captured. He was confined on a prison
ship in New York harbor until his exchange in

In December, 1781, when he Joined Gen. Greene
at the head of the 3rd Virginia regiment. He
removed with his family to Georgia in 1785, and
settled in Oglethorpe County. He represented
that state in the first Yongress, and served
from 1781 to 1791. He was governor of Georgia
in 1793-1796. During his term the Indians were
constantiy in insurrection which he quelled,
but he lost his popularity and excited animosity
by signing the Yazoo fund bill. Mathews was
evidently free from corruption, and he believed

that the legislature had not transcended its

 

 
Mathews, George __ Sketch (3)

 

constitutional powers, in which opinion he was
sustained by the Supreme Court of the United
States. He was subsequently brigadier-general
of militia and in January, 1811, was authorized
by the) president to take possession of West
Florida.

The two pieces of this collection are :
(1) the appointment of Bhilip Milledge as tax

collector for Chatham and Richland counties;
and (2) the deed for a grant of land, Franklin
County to Joseph Phillins. Both papers were

George Matthews, during the period covered
by this collection, was captain of the National
Eagle, a sailing vessel owned by Fisher and Co,
of Boston. Coastwise trade took him to such
ports as New Orleans and San Francisco, and

during these years he made several voyages to
Calcutta, India. The matters which are mention-
ed most often in his letters are the difficulty
of raising and retaining crews for the boat,
wages Of seamen, and death among them, repairs
needed and made on “s" and cargo and

 
Matthews, George 2
provisions.

On one occasion Matthews reported that his
ship was loaded with aéver 1900 tons of cargo.
The cargo he brought from India included salt-
petre, hides, linseed, gunny sack, sugar, rum,
castor o11, and mahogany logs. On his trip to

 

Calcutta in 1856 he took ice bedded in sawdust.
The diseases from which the sailors suffer-
ed were diagnosed usually as scurvy, cholera,
and smallpox. Matthews, on one occasion, attri-
buted their illnesses to the "@irty-poison

liquor" they drank “eo went ashore in

 
 

Matthews, George
Calcutta. Keeping a full crew was a continual

problem. They deserted 66 often that he said
it was out of the question to expect a crew to
ship both ways on a voyage.

On June 4, 1855 he wrote about the amount
of naval stores he had bought in New Orleans

and what he had paid for them. Earlier, May 11,
1855, he had written from there of the low
freight rates on cotton, the shallowness of the
Miss. River at that time, and the number of
ships waiting for cargoes of cotton and tobacco.
In the spring of 1858 eo” up 3000 bales of

 
Matthews, George 4
cotton in New Orleans for Liverpool. Since he
mentioned more than once being at Liverpool, it
is possible that he made that port during his
voyages to India.

Sometimes he mentioned the amount of drafts
he had drawn @6n Fisher and Co. for the operation

 

of the boat. He did banking for the company
with Baring Brothers in London.

The Sepoy revolt is discussed in a letter
of June 18, 1857, and in a letter of May 16,
1859 he mentions the war in India, a number of

ships from the U. S. , on and some of

 
Matthews, George
his acquaintances there, and reveals that he is
a deeply religious man.

In 1860 his daughter accompanied him on a
voyage to Calcutta by way of Liverpool.

In June, 1861, he was back in India, then
at Madras. The next month he sailed to Calcut-

 

ta, where he advertised his ship for sale, as
he feared being captured by Confederate pri-
vateers. He did not sell the ship, and he
loaded it with rice and set sail for Colombo,
Ceylon. In December he received a letter from

his employers stating ry as the U. S. Govt.

 
Matthews, George 6
then had a large blockading force cruising in
American waters, they thought the danger from
privateers much less and should any paying
business to the U. S. offer itself, they would
not object to his taking advantage of it. In
Jan., 1862, he was back in Calcutta, and he did

 

not leave there for the U. S. until April. On
Nov. 5 he wrote from Philadelphia that the
Alabama was doing considerable damage to
northern commerce, but he thinks the Union Navy
will soon be strong enough to stop her activi-

ties. He was then “oe with coal for Cal.

 
Matthews, George 7
At San Francisco he picked up a large quantity
of copper ore, wool, hides, apples, and ice
for the voyage back to Boston. At least part
of the cargo he discharged at Rio de Janeiro.
He asks Fisher and Co. to take out $1500 of
war risk insurance on his wages and possessions

 

for the trip home.

By Mar. 19, 1864 Matthews was back in Cal-
cutta. He heard that English firms were not
disposed to ship any cargo in American bottoms,
and he wrote that no insurance could be obtain-

ed there on American é flying the U. S.

 
Matthews, George 8
flag since the Alabama had been in those waters.

This time he asks his employers to take out
$800 insurance on his possessions on board for
the return trip. He left Calcutta around the
first of May, and his last letter in the col-
lection was written on May 7 as his boat was

 

being towed down the "Eastern Channel" below
Gaspar. He was writing to Lewis Bailey and Co.
of Calcutta that his chief mate, Emil Denis
of Chelsea, Mass., had developed cholera, that
upon the insistence of Denis he had sent him
back to Calcutta, and ee. the company to

Matton, William George. Papers, 1859-1887.
High Point, Guilford Co., North Carolina.
William George Matton (1530-1901), minister
and presiding elder of the northern Methodist
Episcopal Church in North Carolina, was born in
Hereford, England. In 1860 he joined American
Methodism at Brooklyn, New York, where he en-
gaged in church work until late 1866. During
1867-1869 he served variously in the Lincoln,
Catawba, and Cleveland circuits in North Carolina
He was presiding elder of the Eastern District
(1870-1873), the Wilmington District (1874-1876),

the Greensboro District (1877-1880),

 

 
Matton, William George 2
and the Asheville District (1851-1852). In 1883
he got a nominal post as Sunday School and Tem-
perance Agent and was the pastor at Asheville in
1884 and at Fairfield in the West Virginia Con-
ference in 1884-1885. He then retired as a sup-
ernumerary and returned to High Point, N.C. A
brief biographical sketch appears in the minutes

 

of the Blve Ridze Annual Conference in 1892 (p.
51), but the dates given for his appointments
are incorrect; the correct dates can be obtained
from the minutes of each annual conference. His

 
Matton, William George 3
death appears in the minutes of 1901. The iden-
tification of his middle name came from the
letter of his grandson, Charles F. Matton, to
Dr. Douglas Knight on December 21, 1965.

The collection includes Matton's memoirs (13
chapters) of his ministerial career in North
Carolina, a seven-page autobiographical sketch,
a clipping, and part of a sermon or speech.
These manuscripts document Matton’s church work
in New York City, 1859-1866, and in North Caro-
lina, 1867-1887. Prominent topics of the mem-

 

 
Matton, William George ipa
Oars are: the work of the northern Methodists
throughout the state, for Matton's duties
carried him from the mountains to the Coast; re-
lations with the southern Methodists; the reac-
tion of the local citizenry; the relations of
the white and colored membership of the church;
church sponsorship of schools for both white

 

and colored persons, including Bennett College
at Greensboro and the North Carolina Seminary
at High Point; camp meetings; annual conferences
in North Carolina and their presiding bishops;

 
Matton,William George 5
several general conferences of the church; tem-
perance; and local churches throughout the state.

Matton wrote the autobiographical statement
at High Point in 1887. It records his church
work in New York City, 1859-1866, and summarizes
his career in North Carolina, 1867-1887.

The memoirs are undated but were written some-

 

time during 1883-1887. They end with events of
1883 and may have been composed then. A news-
paper clipping contains paragraphs from the be-
ginning of Chapter II, although in somewhat

 
Matton, William George 6
altered form, and it is from The Methodist Herald

 

 

of Mooresville, N.C., March 16, 1337. The
account was to be continued, so Matton's memoirs
were probably published at. least partially in
this journal. However, copies of the Herald are
rare if there are any in existence. It does not
appear in the recent editions of North Carolina

 

Newspapers on Microfilm published by the State
Department of Archives and History or in News-
papers on Microfilm published by the Library of
Congress. It appears in N.W. Ayer and Son's

 

 

 

 
Matton, William George 7
Newspaper Annual only in 1837 and was listed as
established in 1886. It.is also absent from sev-
eral standard union lists of periodicals.

The following discussion is a commentary on
each chapter of the memoirs that can be used as
a general guide to topics and chronology. How-
ever, the memoirs are lively and detailed and a
careful reading of the manuscripts is necessary
on any topic.

Chapter I covers the fall of 1866 and Jan.,
1867. Matton attended the annual session at

 

 

 
Matton, William George 8
Brooklyn of the National Local Preachers’
Association and answered an appeal for preachers
to work in the South. He then attended the
annual conference in January, 1867, of the Vir-
ginia and North Carolina Mission where he was
assigned to the Lincolnton Circuit in North
Carolina. He met William Rawlings of New Jersey

 

who also went to N.C. and who appears in the
memoirs thereafter.

Chapter II closes the conference in Virginia
and chronicles the beginning of Matton's work

 
Matton, William George 9
in the Lincolnton Circuit, along with Rawlings
who had the Dallas Circuit. Matton described
his first encounters with the hostility of the
local citizenry and of the Methodist Church,
South, especially in the person of the Rev. John
Watts. Churches visited include Calvary Mission
and a Negro church at Charlotte, Factory, Iron
Furnace, Bethlehem, and Best's Chapel.

Chapter III concerns events of the spring and
summer of 1867. In the spring Matton and Raw-
lings brought their families to North Carolina.

 

 
Matton, William George 10
At Factory Church Matton had a debate with the
Rev. Watts about his work and the schism in the
church, including the separation in 1845. The
Rev. Miller was assigned to the Negro members,
but Matton took charge of those in the eastern
part of the county who had been crowded out of
the Methodist Church, South. A day school was
begun for the Negroes with the help of the
Freedmen's Bureau.

Chapter IV continues the history for 1867,
beginning with a description of the celebration

 

on July 4 at Lincolnton. Matton commented on

 
Matton, William George 11
Albion W. Tourgée and discussed the controversy
about using Rock Springs Camp Ground, the use of
Fairfield Camp Ground of the Methodist Protes-
tants, a church meeting in Caldwell County, and
other work among both white and colored people.
Chavter V opens with the annual conference
at Richmond in December, 1867, that Matton des-
cribed along with a scene observed at tthe Virgi
ia Constitutional Convention. Matton discussed
his life in Lincolnton, the Seven Springs Camp
Ground, the new camp ground in the northern part

 

 
Matton, William George 12
of the circuit, and trouble with the Km Klux
Klan.

Chapter VI opens with Matton's work in the
mountains and includes descriptions of Wilburn
Waters, an Indian half-breed, camp meetings, and
a basket meeting at Big Spring, Surry County.

In Jan., 1869, the North Carolina Conference was
organized at Union Chapel, Alexander County,
with Bishop Ames presiding. Matton discussed
his work in Lincoln, Rowan, and Cleveland
counties and in the [Iredell Circuit. In August

 

 
Matton, William George 13
there was a camp meeting at Seven Springs.

Chapter VII continues the history for 1869
and has a statement of the condition of the
church. Some of the churches mentioned in the
chapter are Pisgah (Alexander Co.), Antioch
across the Blue Ridge, Friendship (Wilkes Co.),
a camp ground near the New River, and Shiloh.

 

Bishop Janes presided over the annual conference
in January, 1870, at High Point. The first
Negro preacher was ordained, and Matton became
presiding elder of the Eastern District.

 
Matton, William George 14

Chapter VIII covers 1870, beginning with
Matton's new residence at Jamestown, Guilford
County. Comment includes amical relations with
the Quakers, the death of Mrs. Matton, various
churches and camp meetings, a camp meeting at
Bruce's Cross Roads, and relations with the
African Methodist Episcopal Church at Greens-
boro. The annual conference met at the turn of
the year in Lincolnton, and the organization of
the Negro membership was advanced.

Chapter IX includes both 1871 and 1872. In

 

 
Matton, William George 15
1871 Matton continued his work at Greensboro,
and a school was begun. He described life at
Jamestown and meetings at Bruce's Cross Roads,
Chandler's Grove, Matton's Grove, and Snow Camp.
Bishop Simpson presided over the annual confer-
ence at Greensboro. A school was begun at High
Point. Matton attended the General Conference

 

at Brooklyn and related events there. Tourgée
was a lay delegate.

Chapter X covers 1873-1876, including the
annual conferences at Charlotte (Jan., 1873,

 
Matton, William George 16
Bishop Janes presiding), Lexington (Jan., 1874,
Bishop Haven), Greensboro (Jan., 1875, Bishop
Wiley), and Winston (Jan., 1876, Bishop Wiley).
There is discussion of religious and educational
work at Lexington, Wilmington, Raleigh, Greens-
boro, High Point, and Harker's Island. Matton
also joined and assisted the Good Templars.

 

Chapter XI chronicles events of 1877-1880,
including the successive conferences at Wilming-
ton, Lumberton, and Greensboro. [In 1877,
Matton's district extended to the coast. He

 
Matton, William George 17
went to Laurel Hill in the mountains and dedi-
cated a church at the Straits on the coast. In
1878 he described work in the mountains during
which the Rev. Dr. Thayer of Boston accompanied
him for several weeks. He is probably the
Reverend Doctor Lorenzo R. Thayer, the Presiding
Elder of the Boston District in the New England
Conference. A biographical sketch of Thayer

of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Soring
Conferences of 1888, pp. 96-97. wilburn Waters
was encountered aga again. Matton described the
decision at the Greensboro Conference of 1879 to
divide the white and colored membership and the
consequent administrative reorganization. A
movement was begun to acquire the Asheville Dis-
trict from the Holston Conference.

 

 

 

 

 
Matton, William George 18
Chapter XII mentions events of 1880-1882, and
conferences at Concord, Leicester, and Asheville,
respectively. Matton attended the General Con-
ference in Cincinnati (1880) at which the Blue
Ridge Conference was organized. This conference
included the whole state. The Asheville District
was acquired, and Matton became its presiding

 

elder. He favored prohibition but found consid-
erable opposition within the church. His relig-
ious and educational work in the mountains is
chronicled. The Asheville Conference of 1882

added some duties in South Carolina to Matton's

 
Matton, William George 19
responsibilities.

Chapter XIII continues the history for 1882.
Matton worked in his Asheville District and also
in South Carolina, noting meetings at Asheville,
Spartanburg, Highlands, Paint Rock, and Cherokee.
At the Gastonia Conference in January, 1883, he
was retired from gctive service with a nominal
appointment as Sunday School and Temperance
Agent. He was unhappy with this situation.
Chapter XIII, the last one of the chronicle,
ends with a list of the camp meetings that he

 

 
Matton, William George 20
held during his work in North @arolina.

The collection also includes four pages of
an incomplete sermon or speech.

Dabney Herndon Maury, a native of Fredericks-
bury, Va., graduated from the University of
Virginia in 1842 and from the U. S. Military
Academy in 1846. He served in the Mexican War
and on frontier posts in Texas; during the
Civil War he fought under General Earl Van Dorn

in the West, rose to the rank of major general,
and from July, 1863, to the end of the war was

Matthew Fontaine Maury (1806-1873), son of
Richard and Diana (Minor) Maury was born near
Fredericksburg, Va., but in his fifth year the
family moved to a farm near Franklin,
Tennessee. At the age of twelve he entered

Harpeth Academy; in 1825, following an older
brother's example, he secured a midshipman's
warrant. In 1834 he married Ann Hull Herndon
and established his residence at Fredericksburg,
where he began on his A New Theoretical and

 

 
Maury, Mathew Fontaine

Treatise on Navigation. Opjecting to what he
considered favoritism, Maury resigned from and
Exploring Expedition to the South Seas. He
then published five articles in*“Richmond Whig
and Public Advertiser in which he criticized

 

 

the inefficiency of the navy and suggested
reforms.

In 1842 he was appointed superintendent of
the Devot of VYharts and Instruments of the

Navy Department at Washington. He soon began

 
Maury, Mathew Fontaine
(3). Sketch
his researches on winds and currents. Vonfident
that his charts and sailing directions were of
practical value, Mar} turned this interest to
account securing the cooperation of mariners
in noting winds and currents encountered in

 

Various regions. As a result of his labors
a uniffom system of recording oceanographic
data was adopted. On the bases of the data
coming from all parts of the world, Maury

revised the charts fo the Atlantic and Pacific,

 
Maury, Mathew Fontaine
(4) Sketch
which reduced the average time of passage from
New York to San Francisco from 180days to 133
days. Maury prepared a chart representing the
profile of the ocean which was used advantage-
ously in laying the trans-Altantic cable.

 

On the outbreak of the war, Maury resigned
on April 20, 1861 his commission and was soon
commissioned a commander of the Confederate
States Navy: He was sent to England in the

fall of 1862 as special agent of the Confederate

government. ;

At the close of the war Maury offered his
service to the Emperor of Mexico, laying
before him a scheme for the colonization of
former “onfederates, and in August, 1865, he

was appointed commissioner of immigration.

The political upheaval in Mexico prevented any
real settlement. Maury returned to England,
where he devoted himself to the writing of a

series of geographies for school use. He was

 
Maury, Mathew Fontaine
(6) Sketch
awarded a purse of 3000 guineas raised by
public subscription as a token of esteem for
his maritime work and honored by Cambridge with
and LL.D. degree.
He left England in 1868 to accept the

 

professorship of meteorology in the Virginia

Military Institute. Here he spent the last

four years of his life writing and teaching.

Maury expressed disappointment as to the type
of immigrants that come to Mexico. The majority
of letters were written after his return to
the United States in 1868 and deal with the
publication of preliminary report, Physical

residence abroad gave him deep interests and

keen insight into European affairs and consequen
tly his comments on such matters are of interest
and value. The collection contains some person-
al correspondence which sheds light on family
matters. Maury was offered the presidency of
the University of Alabama in 1871. Owing to the

 

precarious financial situation at the Alabama in
stitution Maury did not accept, but returned to
V.M.I.

This collection of letters, journals, diaries
newspaper clippings, booklets, etc., centers on
the personal and business affairs of Richard lL.
Maury (1840-1907), eldest son of Matthew
Fontaine Maury, ("Pathfinder of the Seas"), 1806
1873, renowned hydrographer and naval officer.
(See Matthew F. Maury papers, and D.A.B.)

The correspondence, involving most of the
Maury clan, includes a number of autograph
letters of M.F.M. (mostly to his son Dick),

written between 1861 @e

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 2
In July, 1824, Dabney M. Herndon and his
wife write to their daughter, Eliza, widow of

Capt. John Minor Maury of the United States
Navy. A letter is also received in 1824 by
Eliza from her sister, Ann Hull Herndon (who
becomes the wife of Matthew Fontaine Maury in
1834). Family affairs are discussed, including
Eliza's two-year-old son, Dabney (Confederate
general during the Civil War).

In 1853 and 1859, Stapleton Crutchfield
writes to his father, Oscar Minor Crutchfield,
from Va. Military Institute. Crutchfield, an
1855 graduate of V. “@ remains at the

 

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot a

 

Institute as a professor of mathematics. During
the war Crutchfield serves as Colonel of Artil-
lery in the Army of Northern Va., until his
death at Sailor's Creek, April 5, 1865. His
sister, Susan Gatewood Crutchfield, becomes the
wife of Richard L. Maury in 1862.
Correspondence of 1856, 1858, and 1860 to
Matthew Fontaine Maury (hereafter referred to
as M.F.M.), concerns Maury's investments
and speculation in Minnesota lands. D. A.
Robertson of St. Paul, Minnesota, is Maury's
business advisor there. Robertson advises
Maury of a O“— La Crosse to

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 4

 

 

St. Paul railroad (1860), and comments on the
Negro problem as it may affect Minnesota.

On June 5, 1861 John Minor is concerned
over the loss of Fanny, a runaway house slave.
Dr. Brodie S. Herndon believes that the North
must be punished because of "greed and mammon,
while Virginia must be purged of "the evil. ..
of slavery." Herndon is pessimistic over the
war's possible outcome, for the South.

M.F.M. writes to his son Dick (a student at
U. of Virginia), telling of his attempts to
olace Dick in a Virginia regiment. Dick serves
briefly as a lieutenant.on the staff of Gov.

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 5

 

John Letcher. On June 20, 1861, however,
Letcher orders Dick to report immediately to
Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes at Fredericksburg.
(Richard L. Maury subsequently served throughout
the war in the 24th Virginia Infantry, rising
to colonel of the regiment). During the Battle
of Williamsburg (May 5, 1862), his superior
officers were all either killed or seriously
wounded.

During the Battle of Seven Pines, May 30,
31, 1862, Dick was wounded, and his horse was
killed beneath him.

On July 29, 1862 i ia H. Maury (1842-

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 6

 

1853) writes to his father (".".".) from the
Headquarters of Gen. Dabney H. Maury at
Priceville, Miss., where he is serving as aide
to the General. He mentions the recent marriage
of his brother, Dick, to Susan Gatewood
Crutchfield, of Essex Co., Va. (The marriage
took place at Ridgway, Va., July 17, 1862, at
the home of B. Franklin Minor, while Dick was
recovering from his Seven Pines wounds.) John
H. Maury notes that health and discipline of
the troops at Priceville has improved consider-
ably. His duties include supplying the head-
quarters staff with “oe. food supplies,

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 4

 

which can be obtained only at a considerable
distance. In Augi John is recovering from a
attack of jaundice at Tupelo, Mississippi.

(Lt. John H. Maury was killed in 1863 during

the Vicksburg Campaign. Rumors persisted

during and after the war that he had been

taken prisoner and murdered. His body was never

located. )

A letter of Aug. 22, 1862,reveals that
increasing numbers of slaves are fleeing to
the Federal’ lines.

Dick Maury participated in the major battles
and campaigns of the ‘6 of Northern Va. until

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 8

 

mid-1*04. A son, Matthew Fontaine Maury -"Matt"
was born at Green Branch, Spotsylvania, July

8, 1863. On June 16, 1864, Dick was shot
through both hips during a charge against

the Federal lines below Richmond; for months
afterward he was too crippled to walk. When
Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox,

Colonel Maury, on crutches, was with him.

At war's end, M.F.M., on special assignment
in England for the Confederacy, is offered a
position by Emperor Maximilian of Mexico.
Maximilian wants Maury as his "Imperial
Commissioner of "oe Letters written

 
Maurv, Richard Launcelot

 

to his family in Virginia (May and June, 1865),
are copied by Dick and Sue,#who plan to join
the elder Maury in Mexico. On board the
steamer from Havana to Vera Cruz (May 24), M.F.M
writes that he considers further resistance to
the North as useless, cruel, and the "folly

of madmen." On the stagecoach to Mexico City,
he formulates his plans for the colonization
Scheme. Maury wants 300,000 of the best
families in the South as an upper class gentry
for his "New Virginia." A proportionate number
of Negroes are to be brought and given the
status of "peons,"

*Notebook among volumes, =

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 10

 

On May 25, while aboard the steamer, M.F.M.
sent a document of surrender to the Commanding
Officer of the U.S. Naval Forces in the Gulf of
Mexico. A copy is sent to Dick, who is advised
to do likewise, and to take the oath of
allegiance. M.F.M., obviously bitter at
Jefferson Davis, mentions the “wreck" that
Davis has made of the Southern States. On
June 17, while still waiting for his audience
with Maximilian, M.F.M. bitterly denounces the
Federal proclamation of amnesty, since he
believes it prevents his returning to his family

in Virginia. z

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 11

On October 21, 1865, Dick and Sue, with their
son Matt, arrive in Mexico to assist in the
colonization scheme. Beginning in Oct., 1865,
and continuing through Nov., 1866, Sue writes
lengthy and descriptive letters to her Aunt
Mary in Va. After Dick and Sue have "settled
in," their home becomes a gathering place for
other Confederate exiles, including John B.
Magruder, Henry A. Allen, Walter H. Stevens,
and Alfred Mordecai. Dick is made Assistant
Imperial Commissioner of Colonization by M.F.M.,
at $2500 per year. For Sue, the new life
includes attending “@” evening walks,

 

 

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot =i 12

 

Spanish language Lessons, entertaining at home,
and taking care of her husband and son.
Earlier, M.F.M. has written that Mexicans are
"exclusive" and indisposed to admit foreigners
into their social circle. Sue agrees
considering the Mexicans to be "wholly
uncultivated, entirely unintellectual," as a
result of too little education and an excess
of leisure In addition to Sue's letters,
Dick beg ins a diary, Jan. 1, 1866, which
continues until April of 1867. He assumes the
duties of his father, when M.F.M. leaves for
England on a special 6° for the Emperor.

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 3
Dick is also busily engaged in the writing of
a guide book on Mexico for prospective
immigrants. Sue writes that 500 Southerners
have arrived (in early 1866), with more
coming. Her relatives, she hopes, will not
stay behind to become Yankees,

The hatred of both Dick and Sue for Yankees

 

becomes an obsession during these years of
post-war exile. Sue writes of her loathing

and hatred for the "evil machinations, despotisn,
satanic influence, and impish doings" of Yankees,
Even little Matt is applauded for including
Yankee hatred in his 6 and play. Sue is

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 14

 

also highly prejudiced against Mexicans in

general. Maximilian, she believes, is lacking

in energy and vigor while the Empress Carlotta

is reportedly the more forceful of the two.
Rutson Maury (1805-1882), a New York

cousin of M.F.M., serves as intermediary between

the Maury clan, directing and re-directing

(sometimes forwarding copies of), letters and
parcels to and from England, Mexico , and the
United States. (Rutson, although loyal to the
Union, had been jailed briefly during the war
after a business trip South.)

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 15

 

During Holy Week events in Mexico, Maximilian
and Carlotta participate in a ceremony of
washing and kissing the feet of beggars, after
which each beggar is given a purse. Sue regrets
that Mexico is “a land of no Christian churches.

By June, 1866, the colonization scheme is
shelved by the Emperor (due to political

pressures), and Dick is left unemployed. Dick
feels that both he and his father (in England)
have been treated shabbily, but that he must
swallow his pride. By July 13, desperate and
broke, Dick is compelled to give up his house
and auction the a ) soon afterward, he

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 16

 

learns that his father hos res Signed his commis-
Sion and will not return to Mexico. M.F.M.
investigates job possibilities for Dick through
his contacts in England. Possibilities include
work with a proposed railroad in Nicaragua

(a project of Capt. Bedford Clapperton Trevelyan
Pim,1826-1886, who has launched the Nicaraguan

 

Rails ay Co., Limited), or as manager of a silver
mine, either in Mexico or Nicaragua. In mid-
August Dick is assigned to investigate the
Tepeyopulco Quicksilver Mine in Mexico, and to
report his findings to the Company in London.
(M.F.M. advises Dick t the assignment is

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot Ag

 

 

really a means of testing him). Diek makes two
trips to the mine, and forwards his reports to
Edward Schubert, Secretary of the Company.

Dick believes that, although the mine appears
to be promising, the unstable political condi-
tions in Mexico must be taken into account.

Sue has lost faith in Maximilian, and is
indignant of his treatment of her husband and
father-in-law. She is anxious to leave Mexico,
preferring England to any other place. The
thought of Nicaragua frightens her.

By mid-November, 1866, Dick and Sue have ar-
rived in Havana, a } are staying at the

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 18
Hotel Cubano while awaiting developments. Dick
would prefer Cuba to Nicaragua, and investigates
a possible job involving mahogany timber.
However, he believes himself committed to Pim
(and Alfred A. Pollock) of the Central
American Association.

Letters from Rutson Maury refer to the

 

 

political situation in Mexico. There are also
references to a box of silver which Dick left
at Mexican customs, and which is feared lost.
The Nicaraguan railroad scheme is discussed.
Sue vows to remain with her husband despite

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 19

 

 

an uncertain future. In her blind hatred of
Yankees, she actually believes that the .S.
intends to take over Mexico. She also writes
proudly that her four-year-old-son has insulted
a Northern lady. This is too much for Aunt
Mary, who, in answering, begs Sue to stop
abusing the Yankees. The people of the South,

she contends, have enough to do to retrieve
their fallen fortunes, without hating anyone.
Dick's own attitude is revealed in his
references to "Old R," the New York cousin
who. has been doing so much to help him. Dick
refuses a loan w@ Rutson because (as

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot  _ a a
confided to his diary) he will not accept favors
from a Yankee,

On December 20, 1866, at a Board Meeting of
the Central American Association, Dick is
appointed as Assistant Manager of the Javali
Mine in Nicaraguas He is confident that the
Association recognizes his worth and will

 

eventually raise him to better things.

Books on minerology, geology, metallurgy,
and engineering are requested by Dick and are
sent him through Rutson Maury. In early Jan.,
1867, Rutson meets Capt. Pim in New York City

(Pim is to join Dick , i and accompany the

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 21
Maurys to Nicaragua); Rutson writes that the
job at Javali was concocted solely as a favor
to M.F.M., not for Dick. Dick is also advised
that he must prepare his family for a "Robinson
Crusoe" type of existence at the mine.

A letter from Mrs. Walter H. Stevens to
Rutson in mid-December, 1866, from Vera Cruz,
Mexico (where Stevens is engaged as a railroad
engineer) indicates her deep concern for the
deteriorating political situation in Mexico.
Vera Cruz, however, remains quiet and orderly.
stevens has no heart for his work, but is deter-
mined never to ask “oe to return to the

 

 
Maurv, Richard Launcelot 22
United States.

While still in Cuba, Dick receives a letter
from his sister, Diana Corbin, of Farley Vale,
Va. Dick and Sue are scolded for giving the
impression that only they have suffered from
the Yankees. The Negro problem:is described
as a "festering sore." Diana's little girl,
Nannie, shares her mother's hatred of North-
erners; she has baited a Yankee soldier and
has insulted the American flag. Diana is
certain that the South will never forgive the
North for all they have suffered.

 

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot oe ily

 

On Jan. 31, 1667, Francis H. Smith, Super-
intendent of V.M.I., extends an invitation to
M.F.M. to return to Va. to become professor
at the Institute. Smith is outraged because
M.F.M. has received no credit for the Atlantic
cable -- credit instead going to Cyrus W. Field.

Dick receives a letter from his father,

which leaves no holds barred. The elder Maury
is deeply concerned over Dick's "brusqueness
of manner," and lack of tact and consideration
in dealing with people. Dick's bitterness has
continued too long;. a man-in his position

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 2u

 

he is told, has no right to "flaunt his idio-
syncrasies.". He is told to accept the
consequences of defeat like a man, and show
charity towards Yankees, "as with the rest of
mankind." M.F.M. also gets in a slap at Jeff-
erson Davis again, by his reference to that
“mismanaged affair."

In another scolding letter, M.F.M. edvises
Dick to stop using the cold and formal "Sir"
is letters to his cousin Rutson. Additional
advice from M.F.M. concerns Dick's new position
in Nicaragua; Dick is advised to impress his

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot _ ten’
superiors in London by careful attention
details.

On Jan, 24, 1867, Dick and his family (reduced
to a mere $50) are on their way (via steamer)
to Greytown, Nicaragua. After a week stop-over
at Kingston, Jamaica, they continue with Capt.
Pim. After a difficult trip (be steamers,

 

 

"bongo" dug-out, and mule) the party arrives

at Javali Mine on Feb. 26. Dick immediately
antagonizes both Dr. Siemans, the mine manager,
who has received no official word of his being
replaced, and Capt. Holman, the mine supervisor,

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 26
who resents being asked to vacate his room.
After heated argument, and weeks of tension,
Siemans finally leaves Javali on April 9, and
Dick assumes his duties as manager.

Sue finds conditions at Javali "grievously
rough," ina leaky, crude board house, with
no servants. For Dick, on the other hand,
these are reminders of "dear old Confederate
times." Sue wishes that her husband had more
tact in dealing with men, but gives him credit
for brains and energy. She attributes his rude
ways to the war years. Sue reports that Dick

 

 
is angry at the knocks" gsiven him n by his

family and has vowed never to return, even to
visit. Dick is also glad to have escaped having
to swear allegiance to a government he abhorred.

During the following months Dick and Sue
lead a rough life, which she describes in her
letters.

Dick's salary while at Javali is $9,000 a
year in gold, plus board and lodging. Such
"affluence" brings a request from brother-in-
law, Spottswood Wellford Corbin, for aid in
securing similar work.

Among the letters of 1867 are copies of Dicks
Javali accounts--receipts and bills of exchange.

1867) that he is to be a general agent through-
out the Southern States for a school textbook
publisher. Rutson writes that Major Alfred
Mordecai has found employment as Secretary of
the Pennsylvania Canal Company. A news clipping
(New York Times) of July 11, 1867, (in a letter
of Aug. 29) reveals that M.F.M. will return
to Va., to become a member of the faculty at
V.M.I. The reporter is scornful of one who
tried to get his fellow Virginians to
emigrate to "Paradise."

On Jan. 16, 1868,a baby boy, Richard L.
Maury III ("Dixie") “¢o at Javali. Sue

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 30

 

complains that the worst aspect of their
isolation is the lack of social and religious
privileges.

On June 21, 1868, Dick writes to Nannie Belle
Maury (1858-1939; daughter of William A. Maury),
baby "Dixie" is dead. The body was wrapped in a
piece of Confederate grey uniform and buried in
the woods after services conducted by Dr.

Carter Blake, secretary at the mine.

On July 5, M.F.M. is aboard ship bound for the
U.S.3 he advises Dick to return also. The last
letters from Nicaragua are from Sue, written

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot BBE

 

Aug. 5 and 7, 1868. By March of 1869, they are
re-united with their family in Lexington, Va.
Dick soon becomes a law partner of John Letcher
at Lexington. A vast amount of the letters
which follow deal with the legal affairs and
correspondence of Maury and Letcher, Attorneys.
Other letters are concerned with M.F.M.'s

affairs from 1869 to 1873. Family correspond-
ence also continues,

On March 26, 1870, Dick records the reminis-
cences of Gen. William N. Pendleton, on the
surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox.

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot oo ne
After the war, Pendleton resumed his ministerial
duties at Grace Church. For a time Maury and
his family boarded with him. -Pendleton said
that he and other generals (John B. Gordon and
James Longstreet) had advised Lee that further
fighting was. useless. He also said that Lee
admitted to him that he had never expected

 

victory without foreign intervention.
A May 3, 1870, letter reveals that William
A. Maury, (1832-1918) has been injured in a
cave-~in at the Capitol Building at Richmond.
Business correspondence of M.F.M. concerns

 
Maury, Richard Lancelot 33
his stocks and bonds (handled through a London
bank) and his publications (handled through
Universal Publishing Co., N.Y¥., C.B. Richardson,
E-D. Barker, and his cousin, Rutson Maury).
M.F.M. is also interested in the merits of the
proposed Shenandoah Valley Railroad; his letter
to the President of the railroad is published,

 

His friend, John Laird of Birkenhead, Eng. (June
7, 1870), sends him an extract from the letter
of an officer aboard the British ship, Captain.
The youngest son of M.F.M., Matthew Fontaine
Maury, Jr. ("Matsy"), (1849-1886), who was
trained at the Royal ‘@o° of Chemistry in

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 34

 

London, is a geologist, minerologist, and mining
and civil engineer at Charleston, West Va.,
in 1872. "Matsy" sends Cincinnati coal
statistics to his brother Dick.

In Feb., 1872, Dick receives a letter from
a former Federal soldier, J.H.W. Stuckenberg.
During the Battle of Fredericksburg,
Stuckenberg's regiment occupied the Maury
home. Many books and papers were destroyed,
but some were salvaged by Stuckenberg. These
he offers to return.

M.F.M. died on Feb. 1, 1873, Following

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot _ be hs a
this, letters concern the Maury estate,

overseas investments and publishing rights,

and public subscriptions on behalf of his family.
On Aug. 15, 1873, Marin H. Jansen, a- close
friend of the Maurys during théir English exile,
contends that M.F.M., had made sound investments,
and that his family is well provided for. Soon

 

after his father's death, Dick composes "In
Memoriam," a pamphlet which is mailed to
friends and relatives of M.F.M.

On April 16, 1873, Dick sails for England
on matters of business, In addition to tending
to his father's a | hopes to sell the

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 36
Kenawha coal field lands in West Va. (1196
acres), which are Maury owned. From April to
June, Dick's journal describes his daily routine,
including sight-seeing, in London, Amsterdam,
and the Hague. His stay in Europe extends into
August of 1873. His letters from home are
delivered in care of Baring Bros. and Co.,

 

London, but one (from Capt. Jansen, Aug. 15)
is addressed to Cologne, Prussia. (Dick had
at least two meetings with Capt. Jansen.) Sue
has mostly personal matters to relate. A
daughter, Ann Herndon Maury, was born at

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot pe

 

Lexington, Va., Dec. 13, 1872. On May 4, Sue
writes of the death of Gen. Edward R. S. Canby,
at the hands of Modoc Indians. She feels that
Canby "deserved to be well scalped," but
rerrets that he fell to an Indian rather than
to a Confederate. Little Matt is prevented
from reading "Excelsior" because Henry W.
Longfellow is such a "bad Yankee." Pim and
other Englishmen of the Central American As-
sociation are denounced as "nasty beasts."

A clipping from the Baltimore Sun (May 16,
1873) describes a duel between two Virginians

 

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 38

 

at Richmond, One participant, Mordecai, was
killed. Sue deplores the act, but reserves
most of her anger for the "meddling Yankees"
who have criticized. Other news and a letter
of Gen. Francis H. Smith (Oct. 18, 1873)
concern a building project at the Grace Church
in Lexington.

In Jan., 1874. Dick is again bound for
England on business, and is kept from his family
until Sept. Business matters seem to be gen-
erally the same as before: trying to sell West
Va. lands, and tendins to M.F.M's publishing

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 39
and investment interests. Carbon copies of
his business correspondence in London are
among the journals in this collection. One

of his contacts is the American Lands and
General Commission Agency of London. Other
correspondence’ relates to his social contacts
while in England. Two social letters are sent

 

 

by Jefferson Davis, from Bagswater and Glasgow
(April 23 and May 9, 1874). The Danish Envoy
in London informs Dick that M.F.M.'S Cross of
Danneborg, or a copy, must be returned to Den-
mark, Another award -- a Portuguese medal of

M.F.M. -- is also —_ i

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 40

 

A letter to Dick from the Gauley-Kanawha
Coal Co., Ltd., London (Sept. 2, 1875) indicates
that his West Va. lands are in new hands, or
that Dick has formed a company to work them.

From 1875 to 1880, letters from Sue and Matt
concern primarily family matters. Sometime
during this period (probably 1873), Dick moves
into his own law office in Richmond, and the
Maurys take up residence in that city. Legal
correspondence of this period includes letters
from various insurance companies, concerning
policy claims and premiums. S.S. Herrick,

 
 

Maury, Richard Launcelot ss" 41
Claim Dept. Manager, is Dick's contact with
Universal Life Insurance Co. of New York.

In 1879, Dick begins his project of writing
an account of the Battle of Williamsburg (May
5, 1862). This account (published in the
papers of the Southern Historical Society for
1880) concentrates on the role of the 24th

 

Va. Regiment during the Battle. Correspondents
include Duncan K. McRae (Sept. 11, 1879),

the account of the Williamsburg affair written
by Joseph E. Johnston. During 1880, Dick
sends complimentary copies of his booklet to
former comrades,

In 1881 Matt Maury enters the University
of Virginia at Charlottesville. He had pre-
viously attended Richmond schools, including

 

Richmond College, 1880-1881. His weekly letters
to his father (1881-1885) present a picture

of life at the University during these years.

His teachers include George F. Holmes ("best

of all. .. easy to talk to"), Maximilian de
Vere Schele ("not “ee and Charles S. Venable

 
 

Maury, Richard Launcelot 43
('a great favorite with the boys"), Some of
Matt's comments on academic and social life

are highly revealing. Three letters of Venable
(Nov. 15, Dec. 21, 27, 1882) pertain to Matt's
difficulties in mathematics. The problems of
the young student include: suffering through

a silent love affair with a Miss Betty Harrison,

passing examinations, trying to please his
parents, and constant requests for money.
In 1882 Dick is appointed to purchase an
organ for the Grace Methodist Church at
Lexington. Letters from Rev, William N.

Pendleton (April 5, May 12, 1882) also concern
memorial windows for M.F.M. and Col. Stapleton

(ca. 1883) are Robert H. Maury and Co., Stock
and Exchange Brokers, and Peter J. Otey and
Co., Insurance Agents.

In July, 1884, Matt is at Blenheim, Va.,
with his Aunt Lucy. Instead of returning to
Charlottesville, he expresses an interest in

reading law under his father's supervision.
However, from Oct., 1884, Matt studies law at
the Columbian University Law Department in
Washington, D-C., for a nine-month period.
Among his professors is an uncle, William A.

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 46
Maury, Assistant U.S. Attorney General. Supreme
Court Justice William Strong delivers a series
of lectures on Constitutional vs. states rights.
Matt's letters still contain careful memoranda
of his expenses,and requests for money. In

July of 1885, he returns to Charlottesville to
prepare for the Bar, and in June of 1886 receives

 

his B. L. degree. On Oct. 6, 1885, he writes
of having met Oscar W. Underwood, who, as a
student in 1883, became involved in a near-
duel over a girl.
Letters of May, 1885, concern Dick's quest for

 
Maury, Richard Launcelot 47
the watch of his late brother-in-law, Staple ton
Crutchfield. A letter of Dick was published

in the National Tribune (Zanesville, Ohio), on
Mav 14, ~ 1885. As a result, two informants
reveal that the watch (taken from Stapleton's
body at Sailor's Creek), is in the hands of

B. F. Power of Muskingum, Ohio.

 

 

 

Jarly in 1886 Dick offers to finance a trip
abroad for his son, following graduation in
June. He declines to accompany Matt, on the
excuse of being "played out." Matt's European
tour is described at length in diaries and
in letters to his ““~® These same letters,

published in a Richmond newspaper. His journey
covers Scotland, England, Germany, and Switzer-
land. He is most impressed with the Scots and
Germans, for their courtesy and forbearance.
The Swiss, on the other hand, are criticized

as "money grabbers." But Matt's most

 

revealing criticisms are reserved for the

"Ugly Americans" of 1886 -- the American tourist
"gilded noddies who have come out to be fleeced.
He arrives back in New York on Dec. 6, having
been away for five months. There are no

further letters from him until 1891, when he
writes to his parents from Glasgow, Va.,
where he has a law practice.

On April 7, 1887, James L. Kemper declines
the opportunity to speak at the unveiling of
the monument to Pickett's Division at
Gettysburg. Kemper complains of paralysis
which makes any movement difficult.

to James de la Fontaine, a former Huguenot
pastor.

During 1895, and over the next several
years, Dick receives letters (in French),
concerning his Huguenot ancestors (Fontaines
and Maurys). The Hachette Library in Paris
