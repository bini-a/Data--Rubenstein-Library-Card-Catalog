Pursley, Mary Frances Jane. Papers, 1354-1900.
New Center, York Co., South Carolina

 

The papers of Mary Frances Jane Pursley are
from members of an up-country community in the
York District of South Carolina. Centering in
the Civil War period, they tell the story of a
family group who fought in the 18th South

Carolina Volunteers, C. S. A. Army, as well as

reflect life on the home front in York District
The letters of J. Warren Pursley, who rose from
the rank of private to lst lieutenant of Co. Gy

18th S. C., form a history of his regiment.

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 2
Because no adequate chronicles of its activities
has been found, this sketch is written in some
detail. Cousins, uncles, and his father,
William Pursley, gave glimpses of other South
Carolina units.

Nearly all of the letters in this collection
are addressed to Mary Frances Jane Pursley -

 

Sister Jane-who preserved these papers. The
Pursleys were a clan with related Briant,
Hemphill, Howe and Thomas kin. By the 1850's
some of these families had migrated from North
Carolina through Georgia to Texas and Arkansas,

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 3
So that their letters to Jane Pursley describe
the new country in which they were settling.

In the spring of 1861 Jane wrote to her
brother to describe the Confederate mobilizatio
in York District. Warren Pursley was evidently
absent from home at this time; when he entered
the Confederate service is uncertain; but he

 

was in camp in Charleston in a company from his
own community by December of 1861.

The Confederate letters of 1861 to Jane by
her cousin, James L. [H.?] Howe, a corporal in
Co. F, 5th S. C. Volunteers, began on June 4,

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 4
lSol. He wrote of health conditions, food, the
battlefield of First Manassas, and camp life
in Northern Virginia. The illness of many
people, military and civilian, is seen in tne
letters of the winter of 13861-1862.

J. Warren Pursley began letters to Jane from
Charleston at the end of 1861. On Jan. 5 he

 

described the city, which was to be the base fo
his service in the 18th S. C. Volunteers,
brigadier General Nathan George Evans’ Brigade
(called the Tramp Brigade). Colonels J. M.
Gadberry and William Henry Wallace commanded the

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane be
regiment, with Captains Campbell, Joe Beamguard,
and Samuel W. Good leading Co. G.(Dr. Campbell,
the first captain, was a physician from York
District who entered service with the men of
his community.) Warren Pursley became a ser-
geant by April, 1863, and was a 2nd lieutenant
by 1864. Other York District men in the 18th
3. C. were Pinkney Pursley, Franklin Pursley,
John L. Pursley, Frank Thomas, Joe A. Thomas,
John Lawson, the McCarters, the Jacksons, Oak
Jenkins, Joe Wilson, William Barber, and
William Thomison.

 

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 6

The letters of the first part of 1862 concer
conditions On the South Carolina coast where
General Evans was in command of the Second
District of the Department of South Carolina and
Georgia with headquarters at Adams" Run. (A
West Point graduate of 1848 and a well-known
Indian fighter, Evans entered the Confederate

 

service at the battle of First Manassas). While
in this command Warren Pursley wrote of
Charleston; of guard duty on the coast, where
blockade running was in progress; and finally
of the fight on James Island where his regiment

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 7
helped to repulse tne Federal advance at the
Battle of Secessionville,:S. C.

Meanwhile, Jane heard from Cousin James Howe
in Virginia, where the 5th S. C. was fighting
on the Peninsula. At this point his letters
stop, probably because he was killed or taken
prisoner. Rumor stated in the letters that he
was killed.

Jane Pursley was evidently a skilled weaver,
as her letters to Warren Pursley refer to this.
She lived in a great cotten-growing section of
South Carolina. Her efforts were evidently the

 

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane fe}

 

basis of the supply of clothing she was always
sending during the war to her brother.

The 18th S. C. under Evans' command was sent
to Virginia to join Longstreets' Corps in July,
1862. Warren wrote his impression of Richmond
to Jane on July 7. He was acting as orderly
sergeant of Co. G by this time. By August 14,

1862, he was at Gordonville, Va., awaiting a
fig nt - the Battle of Second Manassas in which
his colonel, J. M. Gadberry, was killed.
William Henry Wallace became colonel. No
letters related the details of this battle. On

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 9

Sept. 27, 1862, Warren Pursley wrote from
Staunton Hospital to Jane to describe how he was
wounded at a succeeding battle - Antietam- and
how he managed to leave the field... He was
transferred to Chimborazo Hospital in Richmond,
where he visited the battlefield of Seven Pines
with its unburied dead.

 

For a brief period in 1862-1863, William
Pursley, father of Jane and Warren, was con-
scripted and served in the 7th Regiment, lst
Corps of S. C. Reserves, at Charleston, Se Ce

Warren Pursley was in Kinston, N. @., in

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 10
November, 1862, with the 18th S. C., when the
Confederate forces repulsed the Federal advance
on Goldsboro. A cousin, A. J. Clinton, 17th
S.C. Volunteers, also wrote of the Battle of
Kinston.

Letters from York District dwell on prices,
crops, hogs, and local social news.

 

The 18th S.C. left Kinston for Wilmington in
Feb., 1363, on the way back to Charleston. On
May 5, 1863, the regiment elected Joe Beamguard
captain, and Sam Good, 2nd lieutenant.

Evidently many soldiers failed to return on time

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane Ls
from furloughs, as General Evans asked on May
24, 1863, that all men in the brigade come back
to their companies at Columbia, S.C., with full
pardons for such offenses. By May 29, 1863,
the 18th S.C. was in Jackson, Mississippi, abou
to take part in the Vicksburg campaign. During
June Warren Pursley was in a convalescent camp

 

with fever. Lack of water and long, hot marche
were conducive to straggling. On July 24, 1863,
the 18th S.C. was in the trenches at Hillsboro,
Mississippi, and on July 28 Warren Pursley gave
Jane a history of “the times since we came out
here." After the “6@ Vicksburg, the reg-

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane Lz
iment returned by train to Savannah, so that
it finally arrived in Charleston by August 3l,
1863. Attacks on Sumter and Charleston contin-
ued, with the Confederate forces mounting a
49,000 pound gun on Sept. 1, 1864. In Sept.
the Baptist missionary, Hawkins, was preaching
as Fort Moultrie was attacked and Fort Wagner
evacuated.

Evidently salt was to be purchased on the
coast, so that Warran Pursley worked out an
arrangement to get it to the up-country.
Federal cannonading broke the monotony of camp

 

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 13
life, but little of a military nature took
place in the winter of 1863-1864. Warren
Pursley studied to pass examinations for a
commission. On Feb. 6, 1864, Uncle Joe Thomas
sent a description of Fort Sumter. Bad con-
ditions in camp and high prices caused dissatis
faction and desertion among the Confederate
troops. This problem of desertion grew more
serious as the end of the war approached.

The 18th S.C. was at Baldwin and Lake City,
Florida, in Feb. and March, 1864, opposing a
Federal invasion. Here Warren commented on the
attitude of an om | captured Negro troops

 

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 14
In April the 13th 5.C. came back to

Charleston, and on May 1, 1864, was sent to
Wilmington, N.C., where Warren noted blockade
running into that port. At Weldon, N.C., on
May 17, 18604, the regiment was rushed to
Virginia under Brigadier General william
Stephen Walker and Colonel william Henry

 

Wallace in time to fight at the Battle of
Bermuda Hundred on May 20, 1864. Warren
Pursley wrote a description of this fight to
Jane, ca. May 20, 1864, describing the loss of
General Walker. Almost immediately the regiment

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane L5
moved to Petersburg, Va. From here warren
wrote again of this action at Bermuda Hundred
in which his Uncle Joe Thomas was mortally
wounded. By June 19, the regiment was en-
trenched and fighting every day. Miserable dut
in trenches beseiged by Union sharpshooters and
cannonading was made worse by poor food and lack

 

of sleep. Until July 30, the regiment was
serving under Brig. General Stephen Elliott,
who now commanded Evans’ old brigade.

The Crater was formed on July 30, 1364, by
the explosion of mines laid by Union sappers

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 16
under Elliott's salient of trenches. Four
companies of the léth &.C. were blown up, as
well as many companies from other S. C.
regiments. Warren Pursley reported on August
10 of digging for bodies. Only nine men were
left in his company and one hundred five in his
regiment. His men were getting supplies from
Federal casualties. General Elliott had been
severely wounded.

On Sept. 25, 1864, Warren Pursley wrote of
the appointment of Colonel William Henry Wallace
as brigadier general. He was to lead his
brigade through the 6 grim winter to

 

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane L7
Appomattox. Pursley became a lst lieutenant on
Oct. 12, 1864. Bad food, bad weather, and pic-
ket duty were monotonous. Discouragement marked
the beginning of 1865, as men deserted in drove
The last letter of Warren Pursley to Jane was
dated March 17, 1865, from Hatcher Run, Va.

His regiment had been pulled from the Petersbur
trenches.

Captain Sam Good was killed in battle near
Petersburg on March 26, 1865. He had enlisted
in Dec., 1861, as a private in the ldth S.C.;
and this date is most probably the time Warren
Pursley entered the eo service. Ina

 

 
Pursley, Mary Frances Jane 13

 

letter in July, 1866, a cousin referred to
Warren as a cripple, but evidently not a bad
one. If so, he must have been wounded after
March 17, 1865.

Copies of a few poems conclude the collection.

Purviance, A., Jr. Papers. Camden, Madison
County, Mississippi

 

The collection consists of a fifty-two page
typewritten transcript of Mississippi soldier,
A. Purviance Jr.'s diary. Entries begin on
July 29, 1863, and end on July 27, 1864. The
entries are usually brief notations. There are

several gaps in the transcription, some of
which are specifically noted and others which
are indicated by blanks left on the typewritten
pages. While Purviance quite often mentions

 
Purviance, A., Jr.

 

high ranking officers, he does not state ex-
plicitly in the text which regiment he is in,

In an undated order from Major H. W. Bridges,
commander of a cavalry battalion, the request is
made that several men be transferred to the
infantry. Bridges states that he believes they
should have the benefit of good field classes.

He lists Purviance's name among others.
Purviance does mention -serving with Daniel R.
Russell, who was with the 20th Mississippi
Infantry. When the entries begin, Purviance

 
Purviance, A., Jr.

 

writes that no order has come for his rein-
statement and later in the entries there seems
to be some confusion as to which commanding
officer he is to serve with. He later mentions
serving in William W. Loring's Division, The
title page of the diary lists Purviance as with

"Russel' Detachment of Cavalry, 20th Miss,
Infantry."

During the course of the diary, Purviance's
company was encamped in different areas of
Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. From Sept. l,

 
Purviance, A., Jr.

 

1863 -until mid-Feb. 1864, Purviance was at
various times in the following areas of
Mississippi: Newton Station; Enterprise;
Meridian; Brandon; Canton; and Garlandsville.
From mid-Feb. 1864 until mid-May 1864, Pur-
viance's company was located in or near the
following areas of Alabama: Linden; Demopolis;
Greensboro; Centreville; Montevallo; Columbiana;
and Talladega. From mid-May, 1864, until the
end of the diary in late July, 1864, Purviance's
company was located in the following areas of

 
Purviance, A., Jr. 5
Georgia: Rome; Calhoun; Resaca; Adairsville;
Cassville; Carterville; Allatoona Station; and
Atlanta. One gets a sense of the troop movements
and activity taking place particularly in
Mississippi and northern Georgia through
Purviance's descriptions,

Many of the entries have to do with the

 

routine activities and chores of camp life in-
cluding: guard and picket duty; brigade drill
and brigade guard; receiving and writing letters;
the whereabouts and concerns of personal ac-
quaintances; and the weather. He also mentions

 
Purviance, A., Jr.
attending religious services and seeing
"mourners." Several times he mentions either
having or seeking meals away from camp. He
mentions going home and visiting family and
friends. On Dec. 20, 1863, Purviance passes his
twenty-second birthday. He said in comparison
to the last three years his first nineteen had
been passed happily. In addition to entries
describing daily activities, Purviance also lists
items relating to finances.

One gets a glimpse of the hazards of railroad

 

 
Purviance, A., Jr.

 

travel. He mentions three train mishaps during
the period covered by the diary.

While early in the entries Purviance mentions
hearing firing, it is not until mid-May, 1864,
after he and his company are in Georgia, that
his company is engaged in battle. He writes
about the considerable fighting which takes

place near Resaca in northern Georgia and
skirmishes that take place in Adairsville. He
describes how excited the civilian population

is around Cassville knowing that the Yankees are

 
Purviance, A., Jr.

 

only four or five miles off. He describes
battle lines formed and the march made by his
company as it made its way to Atlanta by way of
Cartersville and Allatoona Station.

The diary entries end on July 27, while
Purviance's company is engaged in the Battle of
Atlanta. The last few entries are descriptive

of an area under siege, both from a personal

vantage point as well as the description of the
type of maneuvering a company is involved with
when it is in the midst of battle. He mentions

 
Purviance, A., Jr. 9
the death of General Leonidas Polk, who was
killed by a shell in Atlanta. Other leaders that
figure prominently in the Battle of Atlanta are
also mentioned. They include Joseph E. Johnston
John B. Hood and William J. Hardee.

dicate thatSamuel Purviance and his brother,
Robert, were operating a mercantile firm in
Baltimore, the papers of the earliest period
are concerned with political developments.
They indicate that Samuel Purviance in 1776
was chairman of the Committee of Observation

 

for Baltimore County, and in that capacity
gave orders for the capture of the royal gover-
nor, Robert Eden, in his attempted flight

from the country. The plan did not succeed,

 
Purviance-Courteney—-GolLeettor -3-

 

and Purviance was arraigned by the Maryland
Council of Safety to answer charges of not
having consulted other members of his
committee with reference to apprehending Eden.
The collection includes documents probably
used at his interrogation by the Council of
Safety at Annapolis (Apr. 24, 1776) including
notes on the relation of the Committee of Ob-

 
Purvience-CGeurtenay cottectieon -4-

 

servation to the Council of Safety, and ment-
ioning Daniel of St. Thonlas Jenifer” and BRKXEX
Charles Carroll, resolutions of the Committee
condemning Purviance's action, Purviance's
vindication of his behavior, and a copy of the
questions asked Purviance and his answers. It

appears from the papers that a similar charge
was preferred against him in May of 1776 by
the Maryland Convention; aggravated perhaps

 
Purviance-Cewrtensy Collteet+on -5-

 

by the petition of one James Hutchings for
payment for 5 barrels of turpentine confis-
cated by Purviance.

Bearing dates Apr. 10, 1776, and June 18,
1779, are letters describing British depredat-
ions on American shipping.

and continuthg at intervals through Feb.

extension of the Mason-Dixon line to form the
southern boundary of Pennsylvania, and con-
cerning the much-contested legislation by
which the various states ceded their western
lands to the federal government. Among the
latter documents, letters of Geo. Mason giving

Virginia's progress in this legislation and
complaints against the encroachments of the
Vandalia and Indiana land companies figure

 
Purviance—courtrenay-coiteet+eon. -7-

 

most prominently. Correspondence between
Samuel Purviance and Abner Nash during this
period indicates a growing interest in the
western lands, although there are no records
of actual purchases. Papers for 1785 in addi-
tion to a number of deeds and leases of Pur-

viance's real estate in Baltimore, include
letters from William Maclay of Pennsylvania
concerning the sale which he was trying to

 
Purviance—CoustenayrCottectior -8-

 

make of lands owned by S. Purviance on the
Chillisquague River near Sunbury. He observed
that the claims of the New Englanders to these
lands were hindering the s&le. This corres-
pondence extends into 1786. Probably the most
interesting item of the 1786 papers, though,

is a letter (Mar. 6) from Purviance to George
Washington, asking for a description of the
former's 14,000 acres of land on the Kanawha

 
Purviance—Cevurtense+ceiteet+eon -9-

 

River and for prospects of a rise in value

of these lands as the result of improvements
such as the projected James River canal. In
the same letter Purviance alludes to the diffi-

culties encountered by the Susquehamna Canal
ompany (of which he apparently was a member)

in cutting through rock at the upper end of
the canal. Washington's reply does not appear
in the collection.

With the exception of One or two letters

 
Purviance—CeurtensyCotteett+eon -10-

 

from Samuel Purviance's wife, and scattered
letters of his daughter, Letitia, concerning
her schooling in Philadelphia, the family
letters from this pertod are chiefly from his
son, John Henry Purviance. Although there is
no specific allusion to the latter's occupatio

it appears from the heading and content of the
letters that he was supervising his father's
western lands. He compleined frequently of

 
Purviance-—courtenay Collection -lli-

his poor state of health, and in one letter
declared his intention of gofng to live in
France, hoping to benefit by the milder cli-
mate. In a communication dated Apr. 7, 1787,
he commented that Spain's cession of "The
Floridas" to France would be detrimental to

 

the western territory unless France saw trade
advantages in making New Orleans a free port.
In May of the same year, Samuel Purviance

 
Purv ianc e—Cousteney—66++<¢6++40n, -~12-

 

made his will, preparatory to going to Ken-
tucky. According to a newspaper clipping
(A.D.B. Courtenay Scrapbook, 1892-1909) pre-
served by A.D.B. Courtenay, a descendant of
his daughter, Purviance was on board a boat
descending the Ohio when the boat was captured

by a band of hostile Indians. Although some
of the party made their escape, Purviance was
never heard from again.

 
Purviance-—Coupteonay—_cot+-ection. -13-

 

The second large group of letters in this
collection centers around the career of John
Henry Purviance. He apparently brought to
fruition his plans for living in France by
attaching himself in the capacity of secretary
and interpreter to the Monroe mission of 1794.

The resulting documents are the most interest-
ing and perhaps the most valuable part of the
collection. There are several memoranda in

the handwriting of Purviance concerning
official transactions: two dated Jan. 16 and
Oct. ___, 1795, are accounts of interviews
between Monroe and Jean Debrie, a member of
the Committee of Public Safety, concerning the
arbitration of the French-English war, French

suspicion of the Jay Treaty, and the offices
of France in nego€iations pending between the
U.S. and Algiers; one dated Ht. 21, 1796, re-

 
Purvience—Courtens;—_coit+eect+on -15-

cords a conversation between Monroe and one
Fulton, relative to the machinations of one

La Chaise for persuading France to take
possession of Louisiana and Florida as a check
on American expansion, and as a means of luring
Kentucky away from the confederation. Also

 

mentioned are Monroe's efforts to strengthen
ties of western territories to the Union by
asking France to use her influence with Spain

 
Purviance—covurtene;—¢et+eet+on -16-

 

to keep the Mississippi open to Ameriéan
trade; between Dec. 7 and Dec. 31, 1796, there
are a series of memoranda, chiefly from Pur-
vience's hand and written, as he notes, at
Monroe's request, explaining the difficulties
of obtaining cash for a draft for $120,000

sent Monroe by the U.S. Treasury. A letter
from Monroe (Dec. 7, 1796) to Purviance on
this subject seems to express pique at the

 
Purvianc e-Courtene)—¢ol+-eet+-on -17-

bungling methods of the administration.

A number of the papers from this period
are in Monroe's own hand. One of these, al-
though undated, apparently was the outline of
a speech to the National Convention made during
the early part of his first mission to France.

 

Another is the rough draft of a note which
Purviance was to put into French and enclose
with some English newspapers to the French

Purvience-Coupteney—90i+60t+0n -18-

 

minister of foreign affiars, Citizen Dela
Croix. The papers reportedly mentioned Geo.
Hammond, the English minister to the U.S.,

who exposed the contents of the Fauchet letter
for the advantage of England. There are still
Other autograph letters of Monroe to Purviance

written after both men had returned to the U.S.
(see 1801-1802 material). Purviance was appar-
ently asking Monroe to recommend him for fur-

 
Purviance-Gourteney—60i10¢e++-0n -~19-

 

ther work with the diplomatic corps.
Purviance's career from the time Monroe
left him in France in 1796 until Purviance
took a position in the office of the State
Department in Washington in 1817 is involved
and difficult to trace. Several letters to

him written with great circumspection by un-
known Frenchmen between 1794 and 1798 indi-
cate that he was engaged in some sort of

 
Purviance -Govrteney-deot-+:0e+ien -20-

 

questionable activity. It may have been an
instance of diplomatic bribery, or, what seems
more probable, he was speculating in the
assignat, though the collection contains no
indisputable proof of that. He also visited
Havre and Marseilles between these years,

going to the latter place for his health. On
June 27, 1801, Fulwar Skepwith, the American
consul-general at Paris, addressed a letter to

 
5

Purviance—~Courtens+—colitec+4-on -2)-

 

Purviance at Havre, concerning Pierre Louis
Roederer in connection with the ratification
of the treaty of 1800 which concluded the

XYZ affair. In the fall of 1801 Purviance
returned to the U.S., but according to a
letter to him from Monroe dated Mar. 28, 1802,

he was compelled to return to Europe because
of his health. A gap in the correspondence
makes the date of his departure uncertain, but

 
Purvianc e—Countenay—C01+6-0610R -22-

 

there is abundant evidence that he was in
England from 1804 to 1810 (see volumes in the
collection), and that he was Secretary of
Legation in London. In this capacity he re-
ceived a letter dated Mar. 4, 1805, from Geo.
W. Erving re. the forwarding of some diplo-

matic correspondence from Monroe to Lord
Hertford; several letters from Monroe himself
instructing Purviance in the forwarding of

 
Purviance-ecouptenay Collector -23-

 

Giplomatic despatches, the handling of Mon-
roe's personal affairs while he was on a trip
to Paris, and the confirming of William Pinck-
ney as U.S. ambassador to England in 1806; and
from the American painter, John Vanderlyn,
asking Purviance to handle certain business
transactions for him. These four letters
(Jan. 15, 1804 to June 8, 1820) reflect the
financial straits in which Vanderlyn fot

 
Purviance Courteney Cottecttron

 

found himself, and give a running account of
his various projects. Two papers, dated June
16, and Nov. 12, 1806, are apparently rough
drafts of articles by Monroe explaining the
delicate relations existing between the U.S.
and Great Britain and France. There are in-

dications of pique at Jefferson's pocketing
the treaty arranged by Monroe with England.
Among the 1810 papers is one that must

 
Purviance~Courtensay £_Collectton -25-

have come — Purviance's hands through diplo-
matic channe _ Apparently a copy , it is
addressed by” Bie'Lekanal* to an unnamed royal
personage, perhaps Joseph Bonaparte, and urges
him to assert himself. as ruler of Spain, and

to grant to Lakanal "a Spanish distinction."

 

In 1814, Purviance, again in the U.S.,
was just on the eve of another mission to
England. There are numerous instructions from

 
Purv ainc e=Counteneyetreet+on -26-

 

John Graham of the State Department concerning
official papers to be carried by Purviance.

He also had some connection with John J. Astor
at this time as evidenced by the fact that
letters wer¢ addressed to him in Astor's care.
In the course of his travels in this year,

Purviance apparently spent some time in France,
for there are accounts of his expenses there.
This period of his career also furnishes

several interesting documents

One, undated,

 
Purviance-Courtenar60it63++on -27-

 

mentions the restoration of deserting sea-
men. No countries are named, but there was
apparently some connection with the Treaty

of Ghent, and the paper has accordingly been
filed in the 1814 material. A letter dated
Sept. 28, 1815, is addressed to Purviance from

one Barnet who succeeded Fulwar Sk¢pwith in
his consular position in Paris. He mentions
the successes of Commodores Decatur and

 
Purviance-Courtenay— Collection -28-

Bainbridge against the Algierine pirates,
rumors among the French peasantry that Napol-
ean will return, the probable pleasure of the
Federalist Party that the Bourbons are restored
and a great deal of gossip current in diploma-
tic circles. A French document dated simply
"1815" is apparently the explanation of one

serve on the committee trying Marshalg Ney,

and making certain recommendations concerning

France's foreign policy.

In 1817 (May22), the minister of Brazil
sent to the U. 8S. Minister copies of all the
correspondence between himself and the Russian
minister relative to a auestion of dipnlomatic
protocel. Among the 1818 papers is a letter
from Paul Bentalou to John H. Purviance Mention-
ing the desire of Lafayette to be made a member

 
Purviance-Courteney—collection

of the Order of the Cincinnati,

 

The papers of this pneriod are not con-
cerned wholly with affairs of state, however.
From 1796 on, John Henry Purviance was fre-
quently called upon to attend to business
matters concerning the finances of his sister,

Elizabeth Isabella Purviance. When Samuel

 
Purviance-cevpianey-olte6t+-on -dl-

 

Purviance went west in 1787, he left Elizabeth
in the care of Mr, And Mrs. David Stewart of
Baltimore, Stewart naturally handled her finan-
cial affairs making several investments for her
in capital stock of the Bank of Baltimore,

About 1800, Stewart's firm, knownnm as Stewart and
Plunket was dissolved by the death of his partner

 
Purviance ~Coustense+—¢o+1ee++-on -32-

 

Plunket, who left an estate consisting chiefly
of bad debts and claims on the British govern-
ment for capture of his vessels. Stewart,
Plunket's sole executor, employed the English
firm of Brickwood and Daniell to collect these
claims. Their efforts were very successful,
but in the meantime, Stewart had gone into
partnership with his sons under the firm name
of David Stewart and Sons, and Brickwood and

 
Purviance-GoustenaxrCollectian -33-

 

Daniell had not kept account of which claims
were collected for Stewart and Plunket and #K
which for D. Stewart & Sons. This, of course,
produced a complication of claims which was
not finally settled until November, 1818. The
chief contenders were the Plunket legatees,

the assignees of David Stewart & Sons, Bfick-
wood and Daniell, and Elizabeth I. Purviance.
The English solicitor, Alexander Mundell, was

 
Furviance-coeurtenaycoiteetion - 34-

 

retained to press Elizabeth 's interests, and
many communications between them and John H.
Purviance trace the long course of the liti-
gations.

Some of the papers related to this affair

indicate that in 1811 Elizabeth Isabella
Purviance married Hemry Courtehay. It
appears that Courtenay had been previously
married in 1799 to Elizabeth Isabella's

younger half- $$ ter,

 
Purvianc e=Fountenay—ooi+-0e++-0n- -35-

 

Isabella Purviance, and that Edward H. Courte-
nay was the child of the latter. John Henry
Purviance, who never married, was greaily in-
terested in this poy," “bAa“1t was throuch his
efforts that Edward was admitted to West Point
in October, 1817. The third large group of

letters in this collection traces his career
to hts death in 1853.

His earliest letters are especially in-

 
Purviance~Courtens—_cotteetion -36-

 

teresting for they describe with youthful
enthusiasm his work and activities at West
Point. One of these,dated Nov. 18, 1821,
mentions that Cadet [John H. B.] Latrobe re-
signed his commission to study law with Genl,
[Robert Goodloe] Harper. In spite of the fact

that he so arranged his studies as to re-
ceive his commission in less than the usual
time, his record was most commendable, and he

 
Purviance=Ceupteney—co+-eeotion -37-

 

was retained as asst. professor in the Philo-
sophical Department at a salary of $864 per
year, until 1824, and probably until 1826,

when he transferred to Fort Adams in Newpprt
Harbor. A letter of April 24, 1826, from that
place, describes Providence and Taunton, Rhode
Island. There are also several papers concern-
ing the settlement of the estate of Hercules

 
Purviance-CourtenesyCollection -38-

 

Courtenay, Edward's grandfather. He died in
1816, and a thin trickle of papers down to
1826 indicates that it wns not finally settled
until that year. H Cou

By 1828, Edward had a a Miss Harriet
Whitehorn and they had a son, Edward H., Jr.

Edward, Sr., had returned to "West Point as a
full professor of philosophy. During the suce
ceeding decade he changed his position several

 
Purviance-¢surtensyx— collection -39-

times, having taught in Philadelphia, Pa.,
and Mt. Washington, S. Boston, Massachusetts.
While his parents were in Massachusetts,
young Edward Courtenay was in school in Gen-
eva, Ontario Co;, N.¥. There is some corres-
pondence between them, and in one letter they
mention sending him the "Peter Parley" books.
He became very i111 in January, 1838, and died
on Jan. 24,

 

 
Purviance—Govusterey—¢01160+44-0n~ -40-

 

Except for such routine papers as tax receipts,
etc., there is something of a gap in the
collection between 1838 and 1842 when Edward

H. Courtenay accepted the professorship of
mathematics at the University of Virginia. In
the same year he was made an honorary member

of the Washington Literary Society of Ran-
dolph-Macon College.

In 1843, Courtenay's second son, Alexan-

 
Purviance-—seveterney-Ceolleet+eor -41-

 

der Dallas Bache, died. There is no mention
of his first wife's death, but in July of
1846, Courtenay married Miss Virginia Howard
of Charlottesville, Va. Her sister, Laura,
was the wife of William Holmes McGuffey, and
through their family and Professional connec-

tions MEEMXKS¥XMANXEEX (McGuffey was also a
member of the faculty at the University) he
and Courtenay became very intimate. There are

 
Purviance-Cowmmteney-tottectton ~42-

 

a number of letters from McGuffey concerning
family and financial affairs, and he apparently
prepared a eulogy on Courtenay at the time £/’
the latter's death in 1853. Unfortunately the
collection does not contain a copy of this.
Edward H. Courtenay's brother, David, was his
other chief correspondent. David apparently
was connected with a banking or brokerage firm,
for he handled all of Edward's numerous deal-

ings

 
Purviance-Geurteney—cott+ee+2-on ~45~

 

in stotks, especially those of the Erie Rail-
road Co. and Aetna Life Insurance Co.

In 1853, Virginia (Howard) Courtenay,
her 3-weeks-old twin sons, and Edward H.
Courtenay all died between the months of May
and December. From that point on, the collec-

tion traces the history of several generations
of Edward H. and David Courtenay's descendents,
none of whom were particularly distinguished.

The Civil War material is meagre. There
are occasional records of the lst Maryland
Volunteers commanded by Lt. Col. W. T. Dushane.
One letter from Virginia (Howard) Courtenay to
her sister-in-law asking her to hire a white
girl as nurse for the children, comments, "I

do not wish to have anything more to do with
the poor creatures [slaves] than I can help."
There are several letters written bebyBen ssa

during the war years from Edward H. Courtenay,
Jr., who was connedted with the Coastal Sur-
vey in Washington, D.C. Besides descriptions
of the city, his letters contain frequent
allusions to divided sentiment in Maryland, his
own pro-Union sympathies, and the possibilities

of hiring a substitute for the Army. Chauncey

Courtenay (daughters of Edw. H., Sr.) were
both army officers, and the collection con-
tains a few of their papers for the war years,
chiefly commissions and appointments.

After the close of the war in 1865, a
lengthy correspondence passed between David

Courtenay and his son, William, in the U.S.
Engineers' Office, Portland, Maine, concern-
ing West Virginia lands which were a part of

 
Purviance-CousteneyGotteot+-on -47-

 

the Purviance estate. They believed that the
Courtenay descendents were being treated un-
fiarly by the Purviance trustees. Oil had been
discovered in that part of the country, and the
Courtenays were making elaborate plans for
organizing a joint stock company to exploit

the natural resources. The project apparently
never materialized, Scattered through the re-
mainder of the collection are papers concern-

ing the administration of estates, including
those of David S. Courtenay, Sr., Henry Howard
(father of Virginia (Howard) Courtenay), David
Courtenay, Jr. (of Milwaukee), Edward H. Court-

Courtenay, Sarah (Courtenay Brewerton, and

of Elizabeth and Isabella Courtenay. The last
was hotly contested in 1918 by A.D.B. Courtenay
(a cousin) and Lawrence Courtenay (a nephew)

 
Purviance-Gountenay—coiteet+on -49-

on one side, and Francis C. ("Frank") Courtena
(a nephew, of Milwaukee) on the other. There
are also business papers concerning the numer-
ous business ventures of Wm. C. Courtenay, the
stock speculation of several members of the
family, and the financial records of the

 

Maryland Society of the Sons of the American
Revolution and of the 5th Maryland Regiment
Veteran Corps, of both of which organizations

The only papers of great dramatic inter-
est in this portion of the collection are
those concerning the disappearance and prob-
able death of David S. Courtenay (son of E.H.
and Virginia H. Courtenay). They begin in

November of 1873 and run through July, 1874.
In 1869, Edward H. Courtenay, Jr., wrote
interestingly of Cuba's effort to free her-

 
Purvianc e~Gourteney—¢-et-eetron -51-

 

self from Spain, and of the attitude of the
United States towards the situation. There
are also comments on the treatment of Chinese
immigrants in this country. A letter of
David S. Courtenay, who was with the U.S.
Corps of Engineers in Mobile, dated Oct. 28,

1870, mentions the prevalence of "Yellow Jack"
there.

2 items added, 4-6-61: The first of these

concerns business of the Purviance mercantile
firm with their London agents in 1773; the secorm
is a letter of 1800 by Robert Purviance. Robert
Purviance refers to land in Pennsylvania which
may be used to settle claims against the estate
of his brother, possibly Samuel.

4 volumes added, 7-21-77, A substantial mer-
cantile ledger (256 ff.) of 1781-1816 is associ-
ated with this collection by two envelopes of
1908 and 1910 found within it addressed to

Isabella Courtenay and A.D.B. Courtenay respec-
tively. The latter was a descendant of Samuel
Purviance's daughter, and there is some A.D.B.
Courtenay material in the Purviance Papers.
Several pieces of information indicate that
Hercules Courtenay was the owner of the ledger.
A pencilled notation on folio 256 states that
"Hercules Courtenay died Aug. 20, 1816, aged 79
years." More importantly, the account for John
Skinner's estate on f, 254 has a stray entry for

Courtenay. An " Insurance Office” account (f.
216, etc.) includes large sums and runs from
1783 to 1797 with a final entry for 1815. The
later accounts often conclude in 1815 or 1816,
the cash account on f. 231 being a significant
example, There is a large account for the ship
Hercules Courtenay. Hercules Courtenay's son

Henry married [sabella Purviance, daughter of
Samuel Purviance.

Before and during the Revolution and for two
or three decades thereafter, Hercules Courtenay

 
Purviance Family Papers

 

was prominent in the mercantile ana political
life of Baltimore. Information in J. Thomas
Scharf's The Chronicle of Baltimore (Baltimore,
1879,indicates that Courtenay was a merchant in
1771, a member of Baltimore's Committee of Cor-
respondence, a town commissioner in the early
1780's, a prominent figure in the commercial in-
surance business, and a city councilman in 1797,

Commodities were not usually specified, but
accounts for flour (f. 104), ginseng (f. 112),
rum (f. 144), tar (f. 206), wine (f. 206), toba
co (various ff.), corn (ff. 146, 181),

 
 

63); possibly others can be found.
Accounts for ships and shipping ventures are
numerous. The names of prominent persons and
companies appear. There are large accounts for
John Skinner (f. 57, etc.), Thomas Worthington
(£. 40, etc.), Samuel Inglis & Co. (f. 21, etc.)
and Clark and Manwaring (f. 9).

The Daybook, 1801-1804, bears the initials
"H.C." or "I.I.C." on the spine. Memoranda on
the last page include the information that houses
were successively rented on Lexington St. in

1801 (also on p. 27) and Howard St. in 1002.

The Baltimore directory of 1802 lists Henry Cour
tenay as a flour merchant in Lexington Street.
The directory for 1804 lists Henry William Cour-
tenay as a merchant and resident on Howard
Street. The volume, therefore, belonged to Henr
William Courtenay (the name is misspelled as

Courteney in the directories). Flour was a heav
ily traded commodity according to the accounts,
Coffee, salt, butter, and sugar are also promi-
nent. Other items such as nails, flaxseed,

 
Purviance Family Papers 62

 

whiskey, bread, corn, tobacco, bacon, rye, etc.
also appear in the accounts, Courtenay had con-
siderable business with David C. Stewart & Co.
Hercules Courtenay and Elizabeth Purviance have
numerous entries. Hercules Courtenay had a son
Henry (1776-1854) who married (lst) Isabella
Purviance in 1799 and (2nd) Elizabeth Purviance

in 1811, The Daybook dates from Dec. 10, 1801,
to July 17, 1804, with a few stray entries of
Dec., 1804, and April, 1809,

Two extensive volumes, 1764-1779, containing

 
63
three ledgers are from a substantial drugstore
(or apothecary) in Baltimore. There are two
volumes, but one contains two parts. Therefore,
there are three ledgers housed in two volumes.
The order and relationship of these three led-
gers is complicated and not entirely clear, but
there is some progression from one to the other
so that an order is apparent. The three ledgers
are: Old Ledger, 1764-1767; Ledger A, 1767-
1779; and Ledger B or Practice Ledger, 1771-
1775. The Old Ledger and Ledger B are in the

 

 
Purviance Family Papers 64

 

same volume which is marked on the cover as
"Ledger B lst and 2nd," Accounts from the Old
Ledger are continued in Ledger A where they are
marked as being continued from the "0,.L." The
Lux and Bowly account on folio 44 of Ledger A is
marked as carried to f. 91 of the "Practice Led-
ger," and that account is indeed continued on

£, 91 of Ledger B where it is marked as having
come from “Ledger A."' Accounts in Ledger B are
sometimes marked as being carried to a Ledger C
(not in the collection). The two volumes are

 
Purviance Family Papers
thus:

1. Old Ledger, 1764-1767 (ff. 39-145)
Ledger B or Practice Ledger, 1771-1775
(after £. 145 numbered as ff. 1-189)

2. Ledger A, 1767-1779

Ledger A contains settlements of accounts later
than 1779, but it basically ended in 1779 as can
be seen in the continuous drug store, cash, and
sales accounts, all of. which conclude in this
volume in Dec., 1779. Many early accounts in
Ledger A are continued from the "Old Pract.,"
which is not either the Old Ledger or Ledger B.

 

 

 
 

of the drugstore was a person whose
initials were "J:B."' A number of accounts for
different people in Ledger A are marked as having
balances due "J.B." (ff. 28, 33, 39, 79, 80, 85,

89, 115). "J.B." was Dr. John Boyd (1737-1790)
who,’ like Hercules Courtenay and Samuel Purvi-
ance, was a Patriot leader in Baltimore. Boyd

established a drugstore in Baltimore in May,
1767, (earlier according to-these ledgers), and

was a practising physician there (The Maryland
Historical Magazine, Vol. XXXVII, No. 2 noe

1942), p. 1985" The terms "Practice Ledger,"

 
67

P Pract. appear in
the t separate books
for the drugstore and his medical practice. En-
tries in the ledgers for medical services are
minimal and nothing beyond what might be expect-
ed from an apothecary. One of Hercules Courte-
nay's daughters was named Ann Boyd, so the
Boyds may be related to the Courtenays. There
are no accounts for John Boyd in the ledgers, a
circumstance to be expected from his own account

are also common to the sheet, Ledger A, and the

ance belonged to any of those gentlemen.

Drugs were often itemized in the accounts,
especially in the Old Ledger, 1764-1767. There
were a number of entries for inoculations for

smallpox in tle 1770's, Accounts for physicians

cester Co., Mass.

The Regimental Record of Co. A, 25th Massa-=
chusetts Regiment of Volunteers, was written by
Orderly Sergeant Samuel Henry Putnam: of Worces-
ter, Mass., probably in the early 1880's. Co.

A Association had been formed about 1868; its
record was published in Worcester in 1886 on
its eighteenth anniversary. The manuscript vol-=-
ume, the basis for the much more detailed book,
has many notes written in and changes of diction

 
Putnam, 8S.

 

indicated.

Putnam, an educated man, described the mobil-
ization of Co. A, 3rd Battalion of Rifles, under
Capt. Josiah Pickett at Worcester in October,
1861. The muster roll of Co. A stood at 101
officers and men. Three years later, at one
period of fighting only five men were left in
the company.

The men sailed from New York to join Burnside
Expedition against Roanoke Island. They were
part of General John G. Foster's lst Brigade.
Sergeant Putnam describes the action in the

 
 

dense woods on the island, the role of the Union
gunboats, the death of 0. Jennings Wise of Vir-
ginia, and the surrender. By March 12, they
were advancing along the Neuse River to New
Berne. Between pages 16 and 17 is tipped a map
of the defenses of New Berne with the positions
of Union troops indicated.

Mentioned in this fighting were the Wise
Legion, McCullock Rangers, Co. K of the 8th N,
C. Regiment, the 21st and 27th Mass., the 10th
Conn., and the 5lst New York. Fires were burn-
ing in New Berne when the Union forces entered,

 
 

and for. twenty -four hours the soldiers had ™

free run" before quiet settled in the town.

Camp Oliver was formed and Co. A stood on pleas-
ant picket duty with occasional expeditims

to Washington, N. C.3; to Tarboro, Williamston,
Hamilton, and Plymouth; and to Goldsboro. By
Jan., 1863, they were in General Horace Lee's

Brigade, skirmished towards Beaufort and Kinsto

and beat off a Confederate attack on New Bern in
March of 1863. The 5th.and the 6th Mass. with

Rigg's and Belger's batteries and part of the

3rd N. Y. Calvary aided in this repulse.

 
5

 

On Mar. 23, 1863, the regiment went to Ply-
mouth, N. C., and Putnam describes the town,
Unionist refugees fleeing to New Berne for safe-
ty, and a company of N. C. Unionists called
"Buffaloes" (a name given as a joke). The
"“darkies" and social customs (snuff dipping) are
described.

The 25th Mass. continued to march and skirm-
ish during the summer of 1863. Putnam noted
their occupations during lulls in the fighting.
Argument over re-enlistment at the end of three

years became very heated. On Jan. 21, 186), the

 
utnam, S. H, 6
men not re-enlisting were sent to Yorktown,
where Putnam describes the battle field, tren-
ches, and Union dead.

After this time the regiment fought in Vir-
ginia, marched to Bottom's Bridge, and skirm-
ished around Suffolk, Va. They went down the
Dismal Swamp Canal to relieve besieged Plymouth,
arriving too late. On May they went up the
James River to Bermuda Hundred, having at this
time in 186) seven hundred veterans in the regi-
ment. The 23rd, 25th, and 37th Mass., and the
9th N. J. regiments form the First (Flying or

 

 
Putnam, S. H. 7

 

Red Star) Brigade of General Charles Adams Heck-
man, in the Second Division of the XVIII Corps
under General W. F. ("Baldy") Smith. The terri-
ble fighting in May began for the 25th Mass. on
the Richmond and Petersburg R. R.. at Port Wal-
thal, Chesterfield Junction, and Arrowfield
Church. At the battle on Drewry's Bluff the

25th fights well, but its commander, Gen. Chas.
A. Heckman, is captured. Casualties are numer-
ous, the 25th losing 300 in twelve days. On
May 31 contact was made with the V and VI corps
of Grant's Army, and the 25th entered the battle

 
Putnam, Ss. H, 8

 

at Cold Harbor. June 3, 1864, the last day of
the fight, was a "black day," with very high
casualties, About 300 men remained in the regie
ment to make a valiant charge. On June lL, 186h,
only 100 men were fit for duty. After an attack
on Petersburg on June 15, the 25th entered the
trenches before the city on June 19, thus begin=

ning the Siege of Petersburg. Descriptions of
the lines, of skirmishes and attacks, and of
fraternization of the two armies are accompanied
by accounts of the "Petersburg Express" (gun

firing into Petersburg), and the Battle of the

 
9

 

Crater.

The 25th returned to New Berne, where a yel-
low fever epidemic was in progress. Those not
re-enlisting returned to Worcester in Oct., 186)

Abner Pyles was born June 9, 1772, in Gran-
ville County, N. C., the son of Reuben Pyles,
fe removed to South Carolina with his parents
(his mother was a Rochester, but her given name
is not known), was educated there, and began

eaching about 1789 in the Laurene District. He

as a physician and teacher. His autobiography
ts a personal narrative concerning his education
and his four marriages (1798, 1807, 1807, and
1822). He was the father of a large family.
entioned are his oldest daughter Matilda and an

 
Pyles, Abner 2
Older son Lewdy, who was sent to Philadelphia

to receive a medical education, and died of
malaria a few years after he returned to S. C.
The autobiography reveals a number of tragedies
in Pyles's life other than the deaths of three
of his wives. According to his account, his
fourth wife gave him a great deal of trouble and

 

they eventually separated.

Pyles was evidently a man of some means, and
he was a well-known teacher. Among his pupils
were James McKibben, Benjamin C. Yancey, and
John Caldwell. (See John Belton O'Neall, Bio-

Dr. George Clinton Quackenbos, a well known
New York physician and health officer, was of
Dutch ancestry. His mother was a De Witt, so
the family was related to the De Witts and the
Clintons. The son, George Payn Quackenbos
(1826-1881), was named for the family of his

 

mother, Catherine J. (Payn) Quackenbos. The
grandson, John Duncan Quackenbos (1848-19__),

and scientists. See National Cyclopedia of .

Sebastian Co., Arkansas

 

William Quesenbury* (1822-1888) was an editor,
artist, humorist, musician, cartoonist, and
poet. Although a native of Arkansas, he attend-
ed St. Joseph's College in Kentucky. In 1847
he became the editor of the Arkansian. Quesen-

bury served in the U. S. Army both during the
Mexican War and the Civil War. After the Civil
War he moved to Navasota, Texas, where he
edited the Navasota Tablet until 1881. His

 

*pronounced "Cushenberry"

 
Quesenbury, William 2
wife was Adeline (Parks) Quesenbury of Cane Hill
Arkansas. For further biographical information,
see A Pictorial History of Arkansas by Fay
Hempstead, pp. 1102-1104.

The principal significance of this collection
lies in the diary of William Quesenbury, which
includes accounts of a trip to Texas in 1845-

 

1846, a journey to California in 1850, a long
poem based on the Bible, a list of people making
the trip to California for the Cherokee Califor-
nia Company, one or two short poems, a few

 
Quesenbury, William Bad
family records, an occasional entry during

the 1850's, and lists of pupils in a school
taught by Quesenbury in 1848 and 1849.

The section devoted to the Texas trip com-
ments on several topics. Several men, includ-
ing Quesenbury, left Fort Smith on August 29,
1845, apparently on a sight-seeing trip, al-

 

though some were headed for new lands

(continued on next card)

 
Quesenbury, William 3b
on the buffalo range, Travelling generally
westward at first, the party crossed the
Arkansas, Red, Brazos,and San Saba rivers and
reached the Colorado wherethey turned east-
ward for 125 miles to reach Austin.
Quesenbury's account is replete with details

 

of camp life, the illness and death of two
members, food supplies, weather, quarrels

over duties of camping, hunting buffalo,
turkeys, antelope, deer, etc. (many being
killed for the pleasure of proving the hunter's
marksmanship), “6 of rivers, plant

 
qsecnbury, William “
e especially pecan trees and bee trees,

meetings and trade with Caddo, Cherokee,
Comanche, Kickapoo, Shawnee, and Chickasaw
Ind@ans, meetings with other travelers (an
astonishing number of whom he knew), stories
of prowess, and, no doubt, of important

 

local explorers and settlers whom Quesenbury
Calis by name. On December 13, 1845 the
party reached the "Trading House" obtained
supplies and separated, some for "the buffalo
range} some to return home, some for Franklin

Thompson's, and ere” for "Buck

 
wesenbury, William 5

nort," where people drank and raced horses.
There, in a hotel, Quesenbury rested a few
days and read Bulwer's England and the English
before leaving for Austin, Quesenbury went
via Falls of the Brazos, stopping at Major
Merrill's and Major Bryants before reaching

 

 

 

Austin. In Austin he found Major Beall and
met one Captain Sutton, a "conceited" man
who was with Kendall on the Santa Fé expe-
dition. While in Austin Quesenbury read
Prescott's Conquest of Mexico and General
Green's Mier — . Leaving Austin

anuary 3, 1846, he crossed the Colorado River
and Rio Blanco, went by a spot where Indians
had murdered two Dutchmen, saw St. Mark's
Spring and went to Dutch Town (which he de-
scribed) and saw some "real shirt tail chaps
fresh from Germany" who reminded him "more of

a gang of cows than any thing else." While in
San Antonio, he visited numerous missions
which he carefully described, met the famous
Tom Hancock at a fandango, visited Ranger
Camps and met Chevallie,

With William ee left San

 
Quesenbury, William ?
Antonio on February 1, 1846 for home. He
returned more or less by the same trail,
meeting Jesse Chisholm and party at the
Guadalupe, going by Austin, the far prong of
the Waxahatchee, crossing the Trinity on
Mar, 7, 1846, and finally reaching Ft. Smith

 

March 29, 1846. Entries for the return trip
were similar to those coming out, save perhaps
hardly so inclusive,

The second main part of Quesenbury's diary
is concerned with a trip to California. He
went to Cincinnati “6 9, 1850 to begin the

 
Quesenbury, Willian . 8
trip by wagon. Going via a crossing on the
Arkansas River, Pike's Peak (June 7, 1850),
and the Platte, the party of the Cherokee
California Company reached the "Independence
road at last" on July 25, 1850. At "Mormon
Town" some of the group heard Brigham Young

 

preach, Quesenbury includes a long description
of "Mormon Town" with especial objection to

the toll bridges and roads, From that point
forward they met caravans from many different
states, saw many dying animals (counting 454

in one day), broken }é wagons, found boots

 
Quesenbury, William 9
and tools in abandoned wagons, and bought
water at $1.00 per gallon. They started down
the Humboldt Valley July 26, 1850, and almost
one month later reached the vicinity of the
Carson mines in Nevada. During the early
part of the journey Quesenbury wrote of

 

meeting Osage, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne Indians,
killing buffalo, securing information from
Major Fitzpatrick (Indian agent) regarding
trails, bickerings in the camp, etc. As with
the Texas journey, he included minute details
of weather, and ““¢ animal life.

Quin, Frederick, Papers. New Jersey

 

Frederick Quin was born on Aug. 20, c. 1812,
in Cappoquin Parish, County Waterford, Ireland.
The family home was called Cemphire. He was a
rambunctious youth who went from school to
school, job to job, and place to place. His
relationships with his family were difficult.

His family was apparently middle class or above.
One branch of the Quin family, incidentally,

was one of the few of Celtic origin to obtain
an Irish peerage (Earl of Dunraven). His Re-

 
Quin, Frederick 2
collections (40 pp.) describe his early life in
Ireland, England, Canada, and the United States
The manuscript is undated, but the events took
place in the 1820's and 1830's, early 1840's at
the latest. One event reported near the end of
the Recollections, the destruction by patriots

 

of the Chambly barracks near Montreal, dates
that part of Quin's story during the Rebellion
of 1837. The manuscript may have been written
soon after the latest events described.

Quin's school life is the subject of the

 
Quin, Frederick 3
early part of his account. Some details of
school life can be gleaned from it, but he was
mostly interested in describing his escapades
and their consequences which included frequent
floggings. The schools he attended in County
Waterford were: Mr. Brapsen's school at Vil-
lierstown; Mr. Nolan's school at Youghal; and

 

Mr. Graham's school on Stephen Street in Water-
ford. At the latter he knew: the Rev. Ring-
wood, an usher; Robert Maunsell of Limerick
who later was an Episcopal clergyman in the

 
Quin, Frederick 4
U.S.; and the two Watsons who later lived in
Detroit. The last school Quin attended was
Frazer's at Bristol, England. As usual, he ran
away. He then worked for five years at Miller
and Sweet's nursery near Bath from which his
brother had purchased trees. References to his

 

family indicate alienation.

At the Bristol docks he met a recruiting
sergeant of the 4th Dragoon Guards whose method
of persuasion is described. Quin joined the
regiment and later the 6th Rifles. He de-

 
Quin, Frederick 5
scribes some Of his escapades as a soldier. He
went with his regiment to Canada. During the
Rebellion of 1837 he and another soldier ran
away to the United States. At Albany he made
money by fighting one of the dogs taken from
the regimental officers. At New York he made
artificial flies for fishing. The Recollec-
tions end when he was working as a gardener in
New Jersey which was probably in the late
1830's.

Raffles, Sir Thomas Stamford. Papers, 1813-1829
London, Engiand,

 

Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles (1781-1826) was a
British colonial governor in the East Indies,
He participated in the English conquest of Java
in 1811 during the war with France and her sub-
ject states. From 1811 to 1815 Raffles ruled
the former Dutch East Indies as lieutenant gov-
ernor. In 1814 Britain agreed to restore the
islands to the Netherlands, but the actual tran
fer of authority did not take place until 1816.
Raffles later served as governor of Bencoolen on

 
Raffles, Sir Thomas Stamford, 2

 

the island of Sumatra. Besides colonial admini
tration Raffles is noted for his zoological, bo-
tanical, historical, and philological studies of
the East Indies,

The items in this collection relate to the
administration of Java, Bali, and Borneo. On
July 21, 1813, Raffles writes about the exten-

sion of British authority over Sambas, a town
and state of western Borneo, and discusses char-
ges that have been made against his policy in
this action. He notes the views of Captain
George Elliot (later Admiral Sir George Elliot)

 
Raffles, Sir Thomas Stamford, i
on these matters. Also in 1813 Raffles observe

that the authorities in Bengal are displeased
with his revenue arrangements and that he must
exert every effort to prove these policies cor-
rect (letter attached to letter of May 18, 1813)
On March 19, 1814, the lieutenant governor dis-
cusses his dispute with Sir Robert Rollo Gilles-

 

pie, a British commander in the Java expedition
of 1811. Raffles recognizes the seriousness of

Gillespie's charges against him and the likeli-
hood that Lord Moira, Governor General of Benga
is influenced by them, but he believes that his

 
 

Raffles, Sir Thomas Stamford, 4
defense will be successful. This letter is ad-
dressed to Alexander Hare, a friend of Raffles,
who was a British representative in negotiations
with the Sultan of Banjermassin, Borneo, in 181
Hare’ obtained a large grant of land from the
sultan and established himself as a local chief.
There is a note (May 18, 1813) from Joseph Hare
to Alexander Hare, his brother, in care of Raf-
fles (apparently) and his London agents, Fairlie
Bonham and Company.

On March 19, 1814, Raffles asks Hare if Van
de Wahl will provide him with information about

 
Raffles, Sir Thomas Stamford, 5

 

the island of Bali. There is a twenty-six-page
document, dated April 29, 1814, at Banjermassin,
Borneo, that is signed by Van de Wahl. This
document is a description of Bali which the au-
thor states he has visited for eighteen months.
Van de Wahl discusses geography, rulers, local
politics, military defenses, the feasibility of
military operations on the island, and the peo-
ple and some of their customs.

An undated document (5 pp.) has notes on the
recent political and economic history of the
Dutch East Indies, especially of Borneo, and the

 
Raffles, Sir Thomas Stamford, 6

 

economic situation of the Chinese in these is-
lands. Another document (n. p.) is the rough

Baghel family among whom were the Maharajas

a few items in the 1800's, the papers date after
1900. Many of the letters are genealogical in

Ramsay, John (d. 1882). Papers. Seaboard,
Northampton Co., N.C.

 

John Ramsay (d. 1882) was a substantial
farmer who lived at or near Seaboard in
Northampton County. At times he also operated
a general store. During the antebellum period

he owned a number of slaves. Most of the re-
cords in this collection record Ramsay's agri-
cultural and mercantile activities, but there
are also some records for merchant William R.
Tyner (Ramsay was executor of his estate) and

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882)

for Seaboard physician and farmer Dr. Junius
Napoleon Ramsay, executor of John Ramsay's
estate and presumably his son or other close
relation. Dr. Junius N. Ramsay (1836-1900 or
1904) received an A.B. from the University of
North Carolina in 1857 and an M.D. from the
University of Pennsylvania in 1859, served in
the Confederate Army, and was listed in Branson's
North Carolina Business Directory as a physician
for many years and also in the 1880s and 1890s

as a farmer.

 

 

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) iS

This collection consists of five volumes and
a number of items that were found filed inside
the volumes. Three of the volumes have two
parts, because they were used at different times
for different purposes by John Ramsay and to a
lesser degree by William R. Tyner and Junius N.
Ramsay. These volumes which are described
below are:

Volume I:

William R. Tyner's Daybook of General Store,
Jan. 1 - March 10, 1849

 

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882)

 

Volume I (cont'd):

John: Ramsay's Accounts with Agricultural
Laborers and Records of Cotton Picked,
1870-1882;

Volume II:

John Ramsay's Ledger for Agricultural

Laborers, 1878-1880;
Volume III:

Ramsay & Stancell's Ledger of General
Store, 1846-1847

John Ramsay's Ledger, 1873-1882;

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882)
Volume IV:

Volume V:
John Ramsay's Ledger of General Store,
1844-1847
Junius Napoleon Ramsay's Ledger for
Medical Practice, 1867-1873

 

Volume I has two parts: William R. Tyner's
Daybook of General Store, Jan. 1 - March 10,
1849; and John Ramsay's Accounts with Agricultur
al Laborers and Records of Cotton Picked, 1870-

1882.

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 6
William R. Tyner's Daybook of General Store,
Jan. 1 - March 10, 1849, occupies pages 1-61 of
Volume I, and there are also scattered lists,
1849, elsewhere in the volume relating to the
store and to the settlement of Tyner's estate.
According to a document in the William R. Tyner
Papers, in this department, John Ramsay was
executor of Tyner's estate. The store was
located at Smith Church. This Daybook is
identified as Tyner's because the entries can be
traced into his ledger, 1847-1849, in the Tyner

Papers.

 

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882)

John Ramsay's Accounts with Agricultural
Laborers and Records of Cotton Picked, 1870-1882,
occupies most of Volume I. His initials appear
in some of the accounts at the end of the
volume, and several notes and accounts, 1877-
1882, found inside the volume were addressed to
him. The extent and detail of the volume's ac-

 

counts make them a fine record of a farmer's
dealings with his hired laborers, many of whom,
if not all, were black. Occasionally the ac-
counts are with a laborer who was directing a

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 8
group of farm hands. Wages, services, and goods
are all itemized.

Volume II is John Ramsay's Ledger for Agri-
cultural Laborers, 1878-1880 (106 pp.). The
contents are almost entirely accounts for the
laborers in which the transactions for goods,
services, and wages are itemized in detail.

 

Many of the laborers, if not all, were black.
There is also an account for Dr. Junius N.
Ramsay who treated many of the workers.

Volume III has two basic parts, both of them

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 9

 

associated with John Ramsay, and some miscel-—
laneous contents. The first section (252 pp.)
is Ramsay & Stancell's Ledger of General Store,
1846-1847. Many accounts were settled by notes
for equal amounts due John Ramsay and Augustus
H. Stancell who are thus identified as partners
and owners of the store. The 1846 accounts are

not continued from a prior ledger. The 1849
accounts are not marked as continued in a new
volume, and many accounts have plenty of space
for further entries. These facts, and the

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 10

 

notations for many settlements of accounts,
often by notes, in 1847 suggest that the busi-
ness, or at least the partnership, began in
1846 and ended in 1847. Sales of goods are
itemized. Following the end of these accounts
there are two pages listing Ramsay's debts and
financial assets in 1867.

John Ramsay used the later pages of Volume
III for his Ledger, 1873-1882. A number of the
accounts are for businesses including banks and
commission merchants. Among them are companies

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) a
in southeastern Virginia,Portsmouth and other
cities there being the commercial centers for
the region in which Ramsay lived. There are
several accounts for individuals with whom there
were frequent and extensive transactions for
goods and services including the bagging and
sale of cotton. They sometimes picked cotton

on Ramsay's farm. It is not clear who these
people were and whether they were white or black.
Their accounts involve substantially larger
business than do those for the mass of farm

 

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 12
laborers employed by Ramsay, primarily because
bales of cotton were given to Ramsay in payment
of debts. These people apparently raised their
own cotton either on their own farms or on rented
property.

There are entries at the end of this volume
for the estate of John Ramsay who apparently

 

died in 1882. Junius Napoleon Ramsay was his
executor which is why his 1883-1885 account
with Thomas B. Crew is also in the last section

of this volume.

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 13

Volume IV, John Ramsay's Account Book, 1834-
1872 (162 pp.), is especially useful for both
the antebellum and Reconstruction periods. He
used the volume for 38 years, and accounts from
all decades are mixed and scattered about the
volume. The accounts are most abundant for the
1850s and later 1860s, but records for the 1830s,
1840s, and early 1870s are also numerous.

The most unusual aspect of the Account Book,
1834-1872, is Ramsay's accounts with black slave
drivers in the 1850s most of whom also worked

 

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 14
for him and are represented by accounts in the
post-Civil War 1860s. Thus, the accounts record
Ramsay's dealings with these men both as slaves
and as freedmen when they worked for him for
twenty years or more both singly and as super-
visors of groups of workers. The use of first
names only in most cases before the Civil War,

 

and other references to them such as "Anthony of
John Ramsay" and "Number of rails split by Luke,
Anthony & Abner over their tasks" indicate that
these men were black. They include Tom, Randol,

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) LS

 

Abner, Toney, John, Luke, and Anthony, some of
whom were later recorded as Luke Long, Toney
Ramsay, Anthony Ramsay, John Ramsay, and Albert
Ramsay. Some of these men are also noted as
black in Dr. Junius N. Ramsay's Ledger, 1867-
1873 (pp. 330, 380, 393).

The Account Book, 1834-1872, also includes

extensive accounts for cotton picking and cotton
production. In varying quantities there are
also accounts for: the hiring of slaves; white
farm labor, Nat Powell and Edmond Markes and

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 16

 

children apparently being two examples in the
1840s; corn production; expenses and proceeds

of the farm; acreage under production (50 acres
in cotton and 80 in corn, 1869); hogs and meat
production; orphan Allen D. Ramsay for whom John
Ramsay was guardian in the 1830s; cotton packed
and sold for Ramsay and other persons; and

cotton sales. There are accounts for a variety
of persons and transactions.

Volume V has two parts. The earlier part was
the Ledger of General Store, 1844-1847. The

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 17

 

ownership of this store is difficult to ascer-
tain. It had many of the same customers as did
Ramsay & Stancell with whose Ledger of General
Store, 1846-1847, it overlaps in time for sever-
al months. In those accounts for the same
customers during the same months the entries
are different. The style of the ledgers is
somewhat different also: one uses debits and
credits while the other uses a debits column
only. The stores were apparently in the same
community or local area. John Ramsay was

 
Ramsay, John (d,. 1882) 18
apparently either the owner or one of them.

This conclusion is supported by the presence of
entries in the Ledger for General Store, 1844-
1847, that correlate to entries in Ramsay's
Account Book, 1846-1847. For example, Mrs.

Mary Battle boarded with Ramsay for many years,
and entries for her board are in both volumes.

 

Furthermore, there is an entry in Ramsay's
Account Book, 1834-1872, on Sept. 10, 1847, for
"amt. Store a/c with me for 1846 3.54," and
Mrs. Battle's 1846 account in the Ledger for

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 19
General Store (p. 359) includes an outstanding
debt of $3.54.

The second part of Volume V relates to Dr.
Junius Napoleon Ramsay who wrote his accounts
and also notes about diseases and treatments all
through the volume. His accounts date during
1867-1873, but those from 1872 are the most

 

numerous. Some patients were black. Ramsay did
dental work also. These scattered accounts
constitute Dr. Ramsay's Ledger for Medical
Practice, 1867-1873.

The 35 items were found filed inside the five

 
Ramsay, John (d. 1882) 20

 

volumes, and 18 of the items are fragments from
pages of Volume IV, John Ramsay's Account Book,
1834-1872. The other items, 1859-1884 & un-
dated, are clippings and miscellaneous business
papers. They include: a work contract, Junel2,
1865, between John Ramsay and Anthony, a former
slave and one of the task group leaders; a

Norfolk Prices Current, Sept. 25, 1868; papers

Shelf Location: 90-028

Nineteen page typescript by Ramsey describing life
on the Woodmanston Plantation in Liberty County, Ga.
Ramsey indicates at the beginning of the document that
she has based much of her information upon Dr. Joseph
LeConte’s autobiography (he was the son of Louis
LeConte, who came to Georgia in 1810 to manage the
plantation) and the recollections of her mother who
was a niece of Dr. LeConte.

Ramsey, George Junkin. Papers. Lynchburg,
Campbell County, Virginia

 

Papers of James Bevelin Ramsey (1814-1871),
a Presbyterian minister and author, his wife
Sabra S, (Tracy) Ramsey (1822-1885), and their
son George Junkin Ramsey (1857-1928), a dis-
tinguished educator.

Up to 1871, the chief correspondents were
James and Sabra Ramsey. Both were well-educa=
ted, articulate, and gifted descriptive writers.
As one of the first students (1832-1836) at

 
 

-o George J. 2
Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., and then as
a divinity student at Princeton University,
James wrote his mother about student life, the
construction of Lafayette College, the town of
Easton, and his religious growth. After serv-
ing as pastor in a small church in New York,

Ramsey married Elizabeth Peck in 1846. They.
went to Doaksville, Ark., where they worked as
missionaries at Spencer Academy for Boys of the
Choctaw Nation. A folder labelled Spencer

 
Ramsey, George J. 3
Academy Papers contains maps and plans of the
school and some translations from the Bible in
the Choctaw language. After the sudden deaths
of his infant son and wife in 1849, Ramsey re-
turned East to serve as pastor at Mays Lmding,
N.J., but moved to Lynchburg, Va., in 1854 where

 

the climate was healthier.

In 1855, Ramsey decided to remarry and se-
lected Sabra S. Tracy, a local school teacher
originally from Vermont, whom he had seen but
once. She accepted but only after Ramsey con-

 
Ramsey, George J.

vinced her of the morality of belonging to a
church which also had slaveholding members ~~
(see letters, 1855, May 9 and 14). The letters

4

 

of their courtship (1855, Apr.-Sept.) contain
endearments, religious confessions, information
about architecture and house furnishings, plans

for a school, and discussions on the éducation
of women,

A devoted mother to her children, George
Junkin and Sarah E. Ramsey (1858-1881), Sabra
was also ancefficient helpmate in her husband's

 
Ramsey, George J. 5

 

pastoral and educational endeavors. In 1868,
James tried to resign his Lynchburg pastorate
because of poor health. Instead he was given
a full-time assistant and asked to begin a
Presbyterian girls' school. The Ramseys de-
bated whether to set up their own school or

join the staff of Miss Baldwin's in Staunton,
Va., during the summer of 1869 and finally de-
cided on the former course. Both of the Ram-
seys taught in the Lynchburg Female Academy,

 
Ramsey, George J. 6
and Sabra continued to run it from the time of
her husband's death in 1871 till 1879.

After 1871, the correspondence centers
around George Junkin, first with his mother and
sister and then later with his friends and pro-
fessional associates. George attended Fancy
Hill Classical School during the 1871-1872 term

 

and then went to Hampden Sydney College in Va.
(1872-1873) but failed his final exams. For

the next few years, he worked as a clerk in a
book store in Richmond, Va., before returning

 
Ramsey, George J. 7
to Hampden Sydney in 18/6. He graduated in

1878 and then did graduate work at the Univer-
sity of Virginia before taking his first teach-
ing position at Mossy Creek Academy in Augusta
Co., Va. (1879-1880). Mrs. Ramsey gave up the
L.F.A, in 1879 because of poor health and went
to teach at a small school in Bellevue, Va.,

 

where her daughter had been teaching. The
letters during the 1870's concentrate on stu-
dent life at Hampden Sydney, administrative
problems of running a school, trials of

 
Ramsey, Geroge J. 8
teaching, and health cares.

George joined the staff of Ogden College in
Bowling Green, Ky., in 1880 and remained there
until 1884. In that year he married Annie
Stevens and moved to Clinton, La., where he be-
came president of Silliman Female Collegiate

 

Institute. His mother, alone since Sarah's
death in 1881, joined the couple there but
died in 1885.

The majority of the correspondence after
1885 is concerned with the business of running

 
Ramsey, George J.

various schools and educational projects.
George served as president of Silliman from
1884~to 1899. He was an active member of the
Southern Educational Association and became
president of that body in 1897. Over the next
year, he corresponded with the leading Southern
educators making plans for the annual SEA meet-

 

ing to be held in New Orleans in Dec., 1898.
Because of a severe yellow fever epidemic and
quarantine, the meeting had to be postponed
till the following Dec. A milder epidemic in

 
Ramsey, George J. 10
1899 did not cancel the convention but ruined
Ramsey and Silliman Institute financially.
Consequently he resigned from the school and,
after a year's rest, became general editor of
the Educational Department of the B.F. Johnson
Publishing Co. of Richmond, Va.

Ramsey did not care for the publishing bus-

 

iness, however. He became president of King
College, an impoverished men's school in Bris-
tol, Tenn., only to resign the following year.
From 1904 to 1906, he presided over Sayre Insti-
tute, a girls' school in Lexington, Ky., and

 
Ramsey, George J. 11
during 1906-1912, Ramsey was professor of edu-
cation at Central University in Danville, Ky.
Between 1910 and 1912 he also served as assis-
tant to the president of that institution.
During 1912-1916 he was president of Peace In-
stitute in Raleigh, N.C. Ramsey received an
honorary LL.D. from Southern Presbyterian Uni-
versity in 1898, and was always active in the
SEA and the NEA. After 1906 there is very
little material even though Ramsey continued

to lead an active life well into the 1920's.

 

 
Ramsey, George J. 12
The Ramseys had three children: Sumner Morison
(b. 1885), Annie Sabra, and George LeConte

(b. 1885).

This collection is invaluable for the infor-
mation it contains on all facets of education
during the nineteenth and early twentieth cen-
turies. It also has good material on the Pres-

 

byterian Church, particularly in the South,
race relations, the position and education of
women, inventions, architecture, diseases and
home remedies, missionary work, and the trans-
formation of Northerners who lived in the

 
Ramsey, George J. 13
South before and after the Civil War. Undated
items of importance are in a special folder at
the beginning of the undated letters.

The collection also contains legal documents
concerning the sale and purchase of slaves,
proof of parentage of a free mulatto, and con-

 

tracts; financial papers from various education-
al institutions; sermons of James B. Ramsey;
school essays; some printed material; and news-
page clippings. There are 30 volumes in the
collection (21 of George's, 4 of Sarah's, 3 of

 
Ramsey, George J. 14
James's and 2 of Sabra’s) which include finan-
cial records, class notes, commonplace books,
grade books, and letter books. Most of the
letter books are illegible, but the one of 1897-
1899 which contains Ramsey's correspondence for
the SEA is clear and indexed.

The Daniel Curtis Rand papers cover the
Manufacture of gunpowder. The Rand family
from North Charlestown, N. H., sent D. C. Rand
to Wesleyan College, Middletown, Conn., about
1840. He remained there in the gunpowder

making business. Sometime before 1858 he mov-
ed to Pittsford, Monroe County, N. Y., and
entered a partnership with Mortimer Wadams to
manufacture powder. His sister, Lucia Rand,
remained at Middletown, evidently running that
mill. The bulk of ‘oe letters’be-

tween these three people. Connecticut social
life, customs, and description are contained
in the family letters of the Rands, including
those of Stella Rand, the wife of D. C. Rand.
The fluctuation of the Gold Exchange after
1863 is noted as affecting the market for

 

nitrate of soda, an essential in power making.
Arkansas Congressman Logan H. Roots is among
the correspondents. The Wadams family write
two letters in Oct., 1871, describing Chréago
after the fire. Many financial accounts of
powder — included,

Autobiography of Rev. John Rankin, Presby-
terian minister, and of John Parker, freeman,
both of whom were very active in the work of
the "underground railroad" in Ripley, Ohio.
The Rankin,bDiography is in the minister's

own handwriting and was begun when he was
seventy-nine years of age. It gives a de~-
tailed account of his childhood in Kentucky,
including frequent accounts of campmeetings,

denominational rivalries, and other religious

manifestations of the frontier. The bulk of
the work is taken up with a history of his
ministry in Kentucky and THHARERRSXXEXRXXKXXX
Ohio, giving a full picture of the physical

and financial resources of Presbyterian chur-
ches in those states throughout a large part

of the nineteenth century. The latter part of
the work deals with his Abolitionist activities.
He comments on his anti-slavery books (p.90ff.),
their influence on William Lloyd Garrison$p.91),
his work as one of the founders and president

of the American Reformed Tract and Book Society

Society (p.94), the founding of the American

in Ohio. In his anti-slavery lecturing and
activities he frequently encountered mob vio-
lence, all of which is related fully. There
are also occasional accounts of aiding fugitive
slaves to escape into Canada.

pletely factual. Unfortunately, the Rankin auto
biography is not sufficiently detailed to
corroborate most of the incidents.

Included also in the collection is an
account by Gregg of the story of the slave-
woman, Eliza, crossing the Ohio River with her
baby on the melting ice. The story was told
him by the son of the minister, John Rankin, Jr.
Grege gives evidence to prove that Harriet
Beecher Stowe was told the story by the Rev.

Rankin, and that she used it as the basis for
the similar incident in, Uncle Tom's Cabin.

resumed law practice, served in the United
States Senate 1872-1895, and was subsequently
minister to Mexico.

These letters are of small intrinsic value,
one of them being eulogistic of Bedford Brown,
and the other concerning Ransom's family and
ancestors. Robert Ransom was his brother.

The papers of Harriott Horry (Rutledge)
Ravenel (1832-1912), the noted historian and
author of Charleston, S. C., are miscellaneous
in character but not without content. This
collection reflects her distinguished
South Carolina lineage, her great-great grand-
mother being Eliza (Lucas) Pinckney.

the father of Mrs. Ravenel, sends a letter
dated approximately 1805 to his grandmother.

(Later he became a captain in the U.S. Navy.)
His daughter, Harriott Horry Rutledge, married
Dr. St. Julien Ravenel in 1851. On May 27,
1862, Mrs. Rebecca Motte (Lowndes) Rutledge
wrote to this daughter from Charleston. Mrs.

Rutledge described for "Harry" the illness of
John Ravenel, "Harry's" father-in-law, and
told of the condition of Georgia troops in

This collection of war letters (of the

particular individual, but in so far as
they reveal Nevin Ray was the head of the

family. He was a surveyor whose post

office was Carthage in Moore c'iounty, N. C.
Some of the earlier letters give his activ-
ities as asurveyor, and some are from
relatives who had moved to Georgia,
Louisiana and =*

 
RAY, Nevin, Sketch, (2)
Nevin Ray had at least four children: High,
Malcolm, Flora, and Christian. Both Hugh and
Malcolm served in the Confederate army. At the
beginning of the war Hugh Ray was stationed at
Carolina City, three miles west of Morehead City
N.C. For a time Malcolm Ray was encamped in Wak
Co., N.C. Evidently Hugh Ray belonged to Com-
pany H of the 26th N.C.Regiment. During the Civ
11 War period these MSS. consist of the corres-
pondence of these four children and their cous-
ins. The war letters are rather good, though

they are confined to the first two years of the
war.

was then pastor of a church in Le Raysville. The

of his sermons, his other activities, and those

 

of his family. On p. 3 he mentions a small coll-

These letters, being apart of the legal

total significance 1s somewhat obscured by
the fact that they are largely unrelated.

A business letter of Jan. 7, 1849, to John
Meredith Read, Sr. (1797-1874) from J. Pugh in
Washington, D, C,

The South, says Pugh, is divided as to the
policy likely to be adopted by the incoming ad-
ministration of the President-elect, Gen. Zach-

 

ary Taylor, upon the subject of the Wilmot Pro-
viso,. Unless the Southerners present a united
front, the new chief executive will go against
them. But since efforts to unite Southerners
are meeting with more apparent than real success,

Pugh thinks that the success of Northern rights
will be achieved.

Pugh is, however, chiefly concerned with se-
curing the vacant postmastership in in San Fran-
cisco. Secretary of State James Buchanan, who
has more influence with Postmaster Gen. Cave
Johnson than all the world besides, has given
Pugh a strong recommendation. There is further
discussion of Buchanan,

The Reavis family was closely associated
with the postal service at Henderson during its
first three decades of operation in what was
then Granville County. The office was estab-
lished on September 28, 1838, and its first lo-

cation was in the old Reavis home. Lewis Reavis
was the first postmaster. Other postmasters
were George T. Reavis (1843-1845), Lewis H.
Kittle (1845-1850), William w. Reavis }( 1850-°

 
Reavis, William W. 2
1865), Elizabeth L. Reavis (1865-1866), and
Sallie J. Reavis (1866-1869). Elizabeth L.
Reavis may have been acting postmaster at the
outbreak of the Civil War and also postmistress
during the Confederate period. William W. Rea-
vis became postmaster on July 16, 1850, and most
if not all, of the account books date from his
period of service. This information comes

from a historical sketch of the Henderson Post
Office in Samuel Thomas Peace, "Zeb's Black
Baby," Vance County, North Carolina (Henderson,

N. C,., 1955), pp. 298-303.

 

 

 

 
Reavis, William W. 3

The account books constitute an extensive
list of the non-local newspapers and periodicals
that were received in- this community. They
record the quarterly payment of postage and
list the newspapers, periodicals, and their
subscribers individually by name. The period
from late 1849 to mid-1863 is covered with oc-

 

casional gaps in the early 1850's. Newspapers
and periodicals arrived from throughout the
United States. A few British publications
also appear in the accounts.

According to the postal regulations of 1852,

 
Reavis, William W., 4
postmasters were required to keep a quarterly
account of all newspapers and periodicals on
which they collected postage. Postage was
collected in advance. The names of the news-
papers and periodicals were to be recorded.
The account was titled the "Account of Regular
Newspapers and Pamphlets Received." It in-
Cluded newspapers, except for such weekly papers
as were free, and periodicals unless they were
prepaid at the mailing office. Sec the Laws
and Regulations for the Government of the Post

Part II, pp. 50, 56-57.

In 1852 Congress amended the postal laws
so that the postage on newspapers and periodi-
cals was reduced by one-half when it was pre-
paid quarterly or annually. This information
appears in the printed circular of March, 1855,
that the Postmaster General sent to the local

 

postmasters. See Section One of the amendment
of August 30, 1852 (p. 3 of the circular). A
copy of the circular is in the Richard Elward
Papers,

There are two complementary series of account

 
Reavis, William W. 6

 

books. One series has entries by the names of
publications. For example, Harper's Monthly is
entered with a list of its local subscribers.
This series is the most complete and covers the
following years: late 1849-early 1850; July
1-November 30, 1850; an undetermined part of
1851; Jan, 1-Sept. 30, 1852; April 1, 1854-
July 1, 1863.

The other series has entries by the names of
subscribers. For example, George J. Reavis
is entered with a list of the publications that
he received. This series alone records the

 

 
Reavis, William W. ys
amount of postage. There are volumes for the
following years: April 1-September 30, 1852;
October 1, 1857-July 1, 1861.

Both series usually record accounts on a
quarterly basis. The series belong together,
because entries can be traced between them,

There are a few loose papers. Among them is

 

an inventory, April 22, 1869, of the post office
property that Postmistress Virginia C. McCraw
assumed from her predecessor, Sallie J. Reavis.
There are three receipts of 1855 and 1860 with
the signature of William W. Reavis.

Redpath, James

 

to the activities of the Haitian Bureau of
Emigration, which had its headquarters in
Boston, Mass., between 1860 and 1862. The
greater part of the correspondence is from
James Redpath who was in charge of the bureau
and from A. B. Newton who was Corresponding
Secretary.

The letters in the volume give a wide
variety of information on the Haitian emigra-
tion movement. They shed light on the problems

 
Redpath, James 4
that were met with in transportirga large
number of people, who were scattered over the
United States, to an overseas destination.
Much is revealed on the propaganda techniques
employed to recruit emigrants. A number of
letters are concerned with the appointment of
and instructions to agents who were S%rouse
emigration sentiment on the local level.
There are a few letters of instruction from
Redpath to the editors of The Anglo-African,
a New York City newspaper purchased by the
bureau to advocate emigration. Some informa-

through the volume are a few personal letters
from Redpath to abolitionist friends urging
support of the emigration movement.

In addition to information on emigration,

 

the volume sheds some light on the state of
the abolitionist movement and the condition
of the free Negro in the north during the
early part of the Civil War. The correspon-
dence also reveals the views of several

_ A. M. Reed came to St. Augustine, Fla.,
Nov. 12, 1835, and established an agency for
the Southern Life Insurance Co. He retired
in 1848 and chose Yukon, a few miles south of
Jacksonville on the St. Johns River, for his
plantation homesite, which he named "Mul-
berry Grove." He did not buy the place but
leased it for the remainder of his life from
J. R. Pearson.

Reed started his diary at "Mulberry Grove"
on Jan. 1, 1848 and made his last entry in it
on Aug. 4, 1899, two days before his death.

 
Reed, A..M. Diary, 1848-1900. Jacksonville,

At his request the diary was continued to
Jan. 22, 1900 ty J. R. Pearson and Fanny, and
was then dropped, as the surviving members of
the family moved from the plantation to Jack-
sonville.

This diary, of which Duke has only the type
script, is largely a record of work at "Mul-
berry Grove," but the entries which concern
other matters mention a number of people,
events, etc. The diary is not continuous.
For example, the first part of the diary
covers only part of 1348 and then skips to
Jan. 1, 1861.

Alonzo Reed was a negro, resident in Michigan,
who was a private in the 102nd. U.S. Volunteers
a colored regiment which saw $erv¥ice in South
Carolina during the latter part of the “ivil
War. He was apparently drilled in a camp at
Detroit, and sent ot Hilton Head, 8.C. in the
summer of 1864. He remained in that region
until Feb. 1865, when he was in Vharleston, S.C.
after which he was transferred to Savannah, Ga,

and thence back to various places in eastern 8.¢

 

 
Reed, Alonzo. 2

Reed barely escaped total illiteracy, but wrote
some of his letters; the others were apparently
written by friends, and all were addressed to
his mother.

While the letters do not contain very much
information, there are occasional comments on

 

marches, treatment received, and reception by
blacks and whites. The collection is unique
as coming from a Negro soldier in the Union
army, stationed in a region where Negroes were
very num@€rous and presented a great problem to
the Federal government.

Reed, George A. Papers, 1793-1843. Winchester,
Frederick County, Virginia

 

The George A. Reed Papers are those of an
early Methodist preacher of Winchester Va.
His church had evidently taken root by 1772,
when Bishop Asbury first visited there. The
Berkeley Circuit of the Baltimore Conference
was organized in 1778, and from this the Win-

chester Circuit was formed in 1790.
The Reed family was long associated with the
life ef Winchester, the first recorded resident

by that name being Samuel Reed, an attorney in

 
Reed, George A. 2

 

1786. By 1791, George A. Reed was noted as one
of the earliest Metho@ists in Winchester (See
Armstrong, Old Baltimore Conference, p. 98).

He was a local preacher whose hguse was a place
ef preaching, and it is stated that the wives of
this group of Methodists also conducted classes
and prayer meetings. Asbury found an “excellent
house of worship at Winchester in 1793.

 

The Reed Papers are chiefly sermons, with
some hymns, texts, etc., in which are inserted
various miscellaneous accounts. Two eighteenth
century sermons begin the collection, one of

i

 
Reed, George A.

 

3
these manuscripts containing dates in 1793-1796.
On March 11, 1800, George Reed was at the quar-
terly meeting at Shepherdstown, Va.

His journals, so called, are dated 1800 and
1809-1811. These are really religious medita-
tions, which speak of Reed as a leader of men's
and women's classes. Paralleling these journals
is a class roll book, undated but of the same
period.

Asbury's Journal (II, 446) reveals he stop-
ped at the house of George Reed on Nov. 5, 1804,

to preach in Winchester, while. the Baltimore

 
Reed, George A. 4

 

Conference actually convened in the upper room
at Reed's house on April 1, 1805 (II, 465).
The scattered accounts in Reed's various
sermons reveal him to have been a man of some
education and intelligence, who owned property
which he rented profitably. In 1812 he was
one of the incorporators of the Opequon Manu-
facturing Co. of Winchester (See Morton's

The Story of Winchester in Virginia, p. 98).
He was serving as a trustee of the Methodist
Church in 1818 and as justice of the peace in

 

1819.

 
Reed, George A. 5

 

In 1520 George Reed attended the general
Conference of the Methodist Church in Philadel-
phia, where he kept a journal of notes on ser-
mons by Adam Wilson, Alfred Griffith, 0. B.
Brown, and Alexander Taylor, et al.

From 1824 to 1827 he preached at the
Methodist Church on Cameron Street. The sermons
he has left probably date from this period, when
he noted he was also preaching at Old Furnace
by appointment.

How much he became involved in the newly

formed Methodist Protestant church in the 1830's

 
Reed, George A. 6

 

is problematical. He lists in 1836 subscrip-—
tions to itinerant preachers ef that demomina-
tion, and in 1841 he notes preachers on the
Harper's Ferry Circuit.

Family members are named in his accounts,
but it is difficult to determine exact relation-
Ships. One of the sermons in the collection,
dated 1843, is a copy by George A. V. Reed of

an earlier sermon on the text, John 4:7. George
Reed refers a number of times to Robert W. Reed,
who may have been his son and who was a jeweler

at the Sign of the Golden Watch on Main Street.

 
Reed, George A.
He also mentions James Reed anc two children,
George and Edward. George Reed notes money
paid George [A. V. Reed?] who went to St. Louis.
Among the early Methodists named are James Walls
Jesse Rinehart, and Beatty Carson.

James B. T. Reed became. a Confederate chap-
lain, a Masonic officer, preacher of the
Methodist Church in Winchester, and mayor of that

 

Edward Reed is listed as a member of Co. C,
12th Virginia Cavalry, Laurel Brigade.

In October, 1884, William Garrison Reed and

North Carolina where they had served during
1862-1863 with the 44th Massachusetts Volunteer
Militia. Reed's description of this trip,
"North Carolina Revisited," is Chapter XII of
the Record of the Service of the Forty-Fourth
Massachusetts Volunteer Militia in North
Carolina August 1862 to May 1863 (Boston, 1887).

The Reems Creek Woolen Mills date back at
least as early as 1872 when the company first
appears in Branson's North Carolina Business
Directory. It lists the proprietor as J.
Weaver and the product as wool rolls. The

 

Directory for 1869 lists Weaver as operating a
wool carding manufactory. Weaver is listed with
the firm in 1877, but in 1884 he was doing wool
carding only. The woolen factory's operators
were given as Dr. Job in 1884 and John Carnes in

 
Reems Creek Woolen Mills

 

1890 and 1897. The exact nature of the proprie-
torship was probably more complicated. The
factory's Ledger, 1877-1911, lists John Cairns,
E. D. Jobe, and James Frank as each owning one-
third of the business in 1882 (pp. 240-241).

The cash account refers to a "new firm" in 1879
(p. 81). Davison's Textile Blue Book of 1904

 

reported that the company was incorporated in
1884, had capital of $9,800, and operated one
set of cards, five looms, and 210 spindles. At
that time Cairns was superintendent. In 1904

 
Reems Creek Woolen Mills

 

there were only fourteen woolen mills in North
Carolina, all in the western piedmont, foothills
or mountains. The Blue Book for 1910-1911 lists
the factory as for sale.

The Ledger, 1877-1911, contains 262 pages of
accounts. There is also an index. The ledger
is significant because of its early date, the
long period of time covered, the location of the
factory, and the rarity of woolen mills in the
state. This ledger is not the first one used at
the factory, for the early accounts are noted as

being continued from the "Old Ledger." There
were also subsidiary account books as the many

details of the transactions were

kept. Entries for 1877-1878, however, contain

many details

of the transactions. In addition

to the textile business, there were considerable
sales of mercantile goods. The persons making

 
Reems Creek Woolen Mills 5

 

purchases paid their bills in a variety of ways
including goods, services, and work in the
factory. It is possible to identify some of the
millworkers such as Jane Jackson (p. 5) and W.
H. Joiner (p. 7) who are credited with the days
they worked. The factory had business with the
Doe River Woolen Mills during 1877-1879. The
accounts extend as late as 1911, but the greater
activity, at least as recorded in this ledger,
appears to have been during the 1870's, 1880's,
and 1890's.

John W. Reese was a farmer in Buncombe Co.,
North Carolina, who enlisted in the 60th Regi-
ment, North Carolina Infantry, on May 16, 1862.
His regiment went from camp in Greenville,
Tenn., to Murfreesboro and in Dec. 1862,
fought in the Battle of Stone's River. In the

early summer of 1863, it was ordered to Jackson
Miss., in an attempt to relieve Vicksburg.

When that city fell, the regiment returned to
Tennessee and fought in the battles of Chicka-
mauga (Sept., 1863) and Chattanooga (Nov.,

1863). After spending the winter of 1003-1004
in Dalton, Ga., the regiment became part of
Johnston's army resisting the advance of Sher-
man in his Atlanta campaign. Reese was in poor
health during most of his military service; he
spent much time in hospitals and did little
fighting. Though evidently not wounded, he

This collection consists almost entirely of
letters written by Reese‘to his wife, Cristena

6, 1863, describing his regiment's part in the

 
Reese, John Ww. 3

 

Battle of Chattanooga, Reese did not write in
any detail about military activities. His
letters are useful because they reveal the
attitudes of a poorly educated farmer who did
not understand the war and fervently wanted it
to end. He felt almost no loyalty to the
Southern cause but rather worried about his

wife and children on the farm, about getting a
furlough to go home, about sending money to his
wife, and about his poor health. He complains
about the poor food, the shortage of clothing

in the army, and the unreliability of the mails

This combination diary and copybook (145 pp.)
begins as a diary and so runs for most of its
extent. It contains copies of only a few let-
ters but of a number of poems by Reid and a list

of the division of an unidentified estate bet-
ween Mrs. E. L. L. and Mrs. J. F. L. The diary
entries date from April 16, 1839, to March 22,
1840 (pp. 1-89, 97, 101-107, 109-110).

The diary begins on Apr. 16, 1839, with Reid

 
Reid, Henry 2°

 

departing from Columbus, Miss., with his wife.
He leaves her with relatives at "The Grove,"
perhaps either in or near Abbeville, S.C., and
starts out on May 2, 1839, to travel to Pa.,
N.J., and N.Y. in search of funds to build a
Presbyterian church in Columbus. From a couple

of comments much later in his diary it appears
that he was perhaps having little success in
that respect.

On Aug. 28, 1839, Reid arrived back in Abbe-
ville. He commented on the widespread illness

 
Reid, Henry

 

in that area, his view being that it represented
divine retribution, a view he said that was
contrary to that of most of the laity who attri-
buted it to natural causes. On Sept. 15, he
preached at Hopewell in S.C., three times, the
third time to Negroes. Among them, he said, was

a good state of religious feeling, a marked
contrast to the attitudes of whites in that area
toward religion.

Reid left Abbeville on Oct. 18, 1839, for the
Republic of Texas, landing at Galveston on Dec.

 
Reid, Henry 4

 

23. He obtained a certificate of headright for
640 acres of land. For several pages he writes
about his differences with Presbyterian minis-
ters already established in the Republic. Even-
tually he returned to Abbeville District.

On p. 79, Reid revealed that he was a native

of Cabarrus Co., N.C. On that page and the
following one he recorded his experiences in
Concord at a Methodist camp meeting in August,
1839. During his extensive travels he preached
often and attended many other services. He

 
Reid, Henry 5
recorded the texts of his own sermons and of
those he heard preached by others in the Presby-
terian Church and churches of other denominatior
His observations include descriptions of the
views and activities of abolitionists, of the
state of religion in some of the areas through

 

which he traveled, and the differences within
the Presbyterian Church and its division in 183
1838 into Old School and New School Presbyter-
ians,.

tered references to him in Vol. II of George

This volume was acquired with an “addition to
the Hemphill Family Papers, but the relation-
ship between Henry Reid and the Hemphills is not

 

 

 

 

clear. Robert Reid of Erie, Pa., in a letter of

"nephew," and one of Hemphill's sons was named

John James Reid (1844-1889), Scottish
lawyer and Liberal politician, was the eldest
son of Sir James John Reid (1805-1876) of
Mouswold Place, Dumfries. John James Reid

was admitted an advocate in 1870 and became
an advocate depute in 1880. He was queen's
advocate and lord treasurer's remembrancer
for Scotland, 1881-1889. The success of the
Liberal Party in the parliamentary elections

 
Reid, John James 2

of 1880 has been attributed in part to his
work, He was honorary secretary of the East
and North Scotland Liberal Association.
Biographical information on the Reids is in
Frederic Boase's Modern English Biography.
Most of the letters are addressed to John

 

 

James Reid, but a few were sent to his father
and R.C. Reid. These manuscripts were pur-
chased as part of the papers of George
Frederick Samuel Robinson, First Marquis of
Ripon, and they are included in the microfilm

Sir James John Reid was a member of the
supreme council in the Ionian Islands, holding
office of supreme justice in rotation, 1837-
1858. Three letters of 1851 concern constitu-
tional changes affecting the supreme court of
justice,

Two other letters from late in 1879 also
concern the election. In one of them (Dec. 1),
Alexander Craig Sellar, later a Liberal M.P.,
noted the reactions of certain groups of

Tories and Liberals.
In April, 1880, Arthur Elliot reported on
the outcome of the election in Roxburghshire

where he won a seat in the House of Commons.
Lord Stair also commented upon the Scottish

elections (April 7).

On Nov. 19, 1883, Ralph Lingen, permanent
secretary of the treasury, asked Reid how the
proposed Local Government Board for Scotland
would effect economies in administration.
Reid replied in detail on Dec. 4.

Letters of Lord Guthrie and Sir James
Crichton-Browne (Jan. 4,7, 1919) concerned
the Slater murder case and the role of Lord
Loreburn, Reid's brother, in its adjudication.

Reid Family. Papers, 1818-1891. Sumter
Gounty, S. C.

 

William Moultrie Reid was born in Charleston,
S. C., studied at the Presbyterian Seminary
in Columbia, and after ordination settled
in Mt. Clio in the Sumter District of S. C.
He married Margaret Goulding, daughter of

Oo?

Thomas Goulding, a noted Presbyterian clergyman
and educator, and sister of Francis Robert
Goulding, a clergyman, author, and inventor

of a sewing machine that pre-dated the work of

 
Reid Family 2
Elias Howe. Reid and his wife had nine childrem
James Merrick, Moultrie, Thomas Goulding, George
Hardy, Charles, Ann Elizabeth, Sally, Molly,
and Margaret Goulding Reid.

This collection consists principally of let-
ters addressed to William Moultrie and Charles
Reid. The letters contain much information on

 

the Reid family and various Charleston families,
Significant references are made to Princeton and
Harvard universities (Sept. 10, 1818); Davidson
College (Apr. 11, 1868); the Civil War in lower
S. C. (Mar. 9 and Aug. 29, 1864); incidents in

 
Reid Family 3
Charleston (1818-1864); Cameron, Ga. (March 4,
1874); Louisville, Ky. (Dec. 31, 1876);
Christopher Gaillard and the Santee Light
Artillery of the Confederate Army (Aug. 29,1864)
and religious observances among the southern
troops (Aug. 29, 1864).

Prominent correspondents include Thomas and

 

Francis Robert Goulding, John MacRae of North
Carolina, and John Haslett.

125 items added, 4-28-69: Family corres-
pondence, sermons by William Moultrie Reid,

 
Reid Family 4
and a diary kept by him from the end of 1854
until 1875. The correspondence is mainly
personal, although several of the letters con-
tain references to the Civil War in Virginia
where James Merrick, Thomas Goulding, Moultrie,
and George Hardy Reid served with the Confeder-
ate Army.

 

The sermons are expository rather than
topical, and the majority of them were written
to be preached at funerals,

The diary illustrates the life of a clergy-

 
Reid Family Be
man serving a small, rural parish. Reid wrote
mainly about his daily routine and about the
activities of his family and friends in the area
surrounding his church, Various Presbyterian
ministers are mentioned frequently in the diary,
and there are numerous references to the
presbytery in which Reid served. Several gaps

 

occur in the diary, and the entire year 1864
is missing from the manuscript,

The John Ewing Colhoun Papers in the Southern

Historical Collection, University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, contain additional

 
Reid Family 6

letters addressed to William Moultrie Reid from
John Haslett while a student at Harvard, 1816-
1818.

4 items added: 8-28=+82: Letters addressed to
William Moultrie Reid by the Reverend M. D.
Fraser, Presbyterian minister in Winnsboro, S.C.
and by his sister Ann in Charleston; letters

 

from Thomas Goulding and his daughter L. A.
Pond to Reid and his wife; and a letter from
Francis Robert Goulding to Reid. Fraser's
letter is filled with religious sentiments.
Reid's sister Ann mentions a "great revival" in

 
Reid Family 7

 

Bishop Stephen Elliott's school at Montpelier,
Ga., and matters relating to St. Peters Church
in Charleston, and names a reformed and con-
verted young man who has entered Furman Academy
and Theological Institution. Thomas Goulding
writes a gloomy letter, announcing that the

sheriff has levied on his house and lot. Fran-
cis R. Goulding writes from Charleston of his
efforts as an agent of the merchant seamen's
cause to raise money for getting the home for
seamen out of debt. He also reports on his

 
Reid Family

 

service as interim minister for the French
Protestant Church in that city.

Georg Andreas Reimer (1776-1842), bookstore
owner in Berlin, was the recipient of a letter
of November 4, 1830, from the philosopher
Hegel. The letter concerned financial arrange-
ments relative to Hegel's Enzyklopadie that

involved Christian Friedrich Winter. This
letter is probably unpublished. It is referred
to in Hegel's letter of November 9 to Reimer
that is printed in Briefe von und an Hegel.

Reinhard, Leonhard. Papers. Germany(?)

 

The volume (58 pp.) is a manuscript copy in
German of Leonhard Reinhard's Kurzer und deut-
licher Unterricht von dem General-bass in wel-
chem durch deutliche Regeln und leichte Exempel
nach dem neuesten musicalischen Stylo gezeiget
Wird . . . that was first published in 1744.

 

 

 

 

It is a treatise on thorough bass which was a
method of indicating an accompanying part by
the bass notes only, together with figures des-
ignating the chief intervals and chords to be

 
Reinhard, Leonhard 2

 

played above the bass notes. This stenographic
system was universally used in the baroque pe-
riod (1600-1750). See the Harvard Dictionary
of Music. Reinhard (b. 1710) is described on
the title page of the manuscript as "Litterarum
Humaniorum & Musices Cultore."

It is not clear who copied the manuscript.
Underneath the paper on the front cover are the
name of Peter Hard and the date of Oct. 3,
1784. A name and initials also appear on the

title page.

 

 
Reinhard, Leonhard

 

There is also the question of whether or
not the copy originated in Germany or else-
where, perhaps among German-Americans. The
watermark and countermark are very similar to
No. 188 in: Paper Publications Society, The
Nostitz Papers; Notes on Watermarks Found in
the German Imperial Archives of the I7th and
18th Centuries . . . (Hilversum, Holland, 1956)
plate 42, pp. 45-47. No, 188 dates from 1766.
The watermark consists of the crosier of Basle
in a chaplet of two branches forming a wreath

 

 

 

 

 
Reinhard, Leonhard

 

or surround. Paper with this watermark was
made not only in Switzerland but also in Al-
sace, Baden, Lorraine, etc., and it was dis-
tributed in Switzerland, Germany, Austria-
Hungary, the Low Countries, etc. Since the
paper is from Germany or adjacent areas, the
manuscript probably is European also. Good

examples of the watermark and countermark ap-
pear on pp. 55-56 and the end flyleaf, respec-
tively, of the manuscript. If necessary, this
watermark might be checked in Paul Heitz, Les

These records are Of the 1st North Carolina
Colored Troops, the U. S. 35th Colored Troops,
and the U. S. 103rd Colored Troops. Most of
the papers are monthly and quarterly inventory
reports of clothing, ordnance supplies, and
other items of military equipment issued to

individual soldiers. Many of the records are
signed by Lieutenant Clarke H. Remick, later
Captain Clarke H. Remick, who was an officer in

each of the above regiments. Other items per-
tain to his duties as Provost Marshall of

Savannah, including making payments to U. S.
detectives.

These regiments of Negro troops were raised
under the Department of the South, headquartered
at Hilton Head, South Carolina. The lst North
Carolina Colored Troops, who after March 26,
1864, were désignated as the 35th U. S. Colored

 

Troops, were originally raised by Brigadier-
General Wild under the direction of Major-Gen-
eral J. G. Foster. In March, 1864, this regi-
ment was transferred from Folly Island, South
Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida, to take

 
Remick, Clarke H. 3

part in operations there. Also under the super-
vision of Major-General J. G. Foster the 103rd
U. S. Colored Troops were organized early in
1865 and in March were assigned to the brigade

of Colonel W. T. Bennet for garrison duty in

Dr. B. G. Rennolds was a physician at
Lloyds, Essex County, Virginia. He is listed
in Chataigne's Virginia Business Directory and
Gazeteer for 1877-1878, p. 462. Some informa-
tion about this Essex County family appears in

 

the Encyclopedia of Virginia Biography, Vol.
IV, pp. 255-256.

 

 

The item is a statement of Dr. Rennold's

 
Rennolds, B. G.

services to Miss Sally H. A. Hunter during
February, 1863, through October, 1864, with

a few additional entries of 1865-1867 for in-
terest and visits. Many of the 1863-1864 en-
tries appear to be for the treatment of slaves.

Except for the seven letters written in 1905
and 1906 by the noted portrait and landscape
painter Worthington Whittredge to Sarah (Wilson)
Whitridge and her husband Victor, and two items

relative to the service of Capt. William E.
Whitridge in the 43 Regt. of Indiana Volunteer
Infantry, this is a collection of Revell family
papers. The donor of the collection, Dr.

 
Revell-Whitridge Family a
Eugenia (Remelin) Whittredge (Mrs. Henry Revell)
was the daughter-in-law of Victor and Sarah
(Wilson) Whitridge. The origin of the variant
spelling of Whittredge is not revealed in the
genealogy.

The Revell family letters were nearly all
written to Francis Henry Revell, and the
principal correspondent was his brother James.
In 1813 Francis was living in Arlow, where at one
time he was high constable, and he owned
"Killinskeyduff." By July 18, 1818, he had

 

 
Revell-Whitridge Family

emigrated to Montgomery, Ohio, where he and
Henry Gregory, another Irishman, formed a
partnership to operate a business. It was per-
haps a mercantile firm. Their partnership was
very short-lived, and Revell blamed the failure
on what he referred to as the speculation and
dishonesty of Gregory. He even laid some blame
on his nephew John Sherwood who had come over to
Ireland to work for the firm. John returned
home in 1821 and died in 1824. John's father,
Aris W. Sherwood, was a contractor and county

 

 
Revell-Whitridge Family

 

official in Arklow. His mother Mary has two
letters in the collection.

On Feb. 24, 1823, Mary Sherwood wrote from
‘Arklow to her brother Francis that he would be
surprised at the number of public schools they
have and are to have. She described the
wretched economic conditions in Ireland, and
mentionedthe lawless activities of the adherents
of Ribbonism, an Irish secret society movement,
her husband's absence in Dublin trying to settle
the county's business, and the apprenticing of

 
Revell-Whitridge Family 5

 

two of their sons, one to a physician and the
other to the operator of a Birmingham warehouse.
On Dec. 19, 1831, she wrote to Francis, express-
ing her sorrow over his neglect of her. She
says her husband and Robert Revell had nothing
to do with Henry Gregory selling his land, and
that he has been unjust to Henry, who became a

victim of the schemes of William Gregory.
When Francis left for the United States he

left his brother James in charge of renting

"Killinskeyduff." Several of James's letters

 
Revell-Whitridge Family i 6

 

reveal Francis's dissatisfaction with the
management of the property and his returns from
it. In 1813, James was living in Dublin, and it
appears that that was his address for most if
not all of the time before he came to the United
States sometime before Feb. 21, 1836. By that
date he and his nephew William Sherwood were

living in the vincinity of Winchester, I1l.

On Apr. 2, 1838, James wrote to Francis from
Dublin a long letter about his voyage, family
members and mutual acquaintances, his travels in
Ireland, economic conditions, crime and unrest,

 
Revell-Whitridge Family 7

 

and the raising of large numbers of troops to be
sent to Canada. James had considered coming to
the U. S. soon after Francis came, but the ill-
ness and death of his first wife in 1821 and
perhaps economic conditions delayed his emigra-
tion. Sometime between his letter from Dublin
in May, 1838, and his next one in the collection

dated Oct. 12, 1849, he had remarried and
settled in Williamsburgh, N. Y.

All of the letters by the Revells and Sher-
woods are well written, so the style and content
of their letters reveal that their authors were

 
Revell-Whitridge Family 8
educated and that a number of their family were
either substantial landholders, businessmen, or
professionals. Henry Revell was a curate,
although one often on the move for at least
several years, and Aris Sherwood, Jr., was a
graduate of the Royal College of Surgeons in
London. James told his brother Francis in 1830

 

that he had helped support Aris while he was
studying medicine and that he thought because of
the low pay he was receiving for his practice he
should emigrate to the U. S. There is no evi-
dence in the papers that he ever did.

 
Revell-Whitridge Family 9
Francis also had a brother Robert in Ireland.
Francis's relationship to John Revell of Hart-
well, Ireland, from whom he received a long
letter of Feb. 25, 1829, is not clear. John
obviously was a prosperous farmer and dairyman.
It was James, though, to whom Francis owed the
most aS a manager of his affairs in Ireland and

 

as an informer on family members and conditions
and events in their native land. Among the
revelations in his letters are the conversion of
large numbers of Catholics to Methodism and other

 
Revell-Whitridge Family 10
Protestant faiths, the difficulties in collect-—
ing debts, the terrible poverty, unrest among
the people, and the tremendous emigration to the
U. S. and Canada.

The only letter by Francis Revell is a draft
addressed to his curate nephew Henry that follows
copies of three legal documents about the

 

dissolution of the partnership of Gregory and
Revell. Francis was still unmarried in 1822
when he was drafting the letter. He made an
offer of land to Henry if he would emigrate, but

 
Revell-Whitridge Family Lt
he contrasted for him the lot of poorly-paid
clergymen in Ohio with those in Ireland. In the
course of the letter he told him of his involve-
ment with the local militia known as the Preble
Light Cavalry. For some years he lived in Preble
County, Ohio, but later returned to Hamilton
County near Montgomery. Francis married Rebecca

 

Reck in 1824, and they had nine children. Her
death from cancer in 1878 is announced on a
funeral card. No information about Francis
appears in the collection after 1849,

 
Revell-Whitridge Family 12Z

 

The letters by Worthington Whittredge, 1905-
1906, concern his relationships with certain
Whitridge relatives from his early years, the
interest of himself and the Victor Whitridges of
Baltimore in visiting each other, their mutual
interests in genealogy, his three daughters, and
his painting.

Thomas C. Reynolds was an attorney in Jeffer-
son City, Mo. On January 21, 1861, the letter
comprising this collection was written to him
by John W. Noell, U. S. Representative from
Mo. Noel was concerned about getting an appro-

priation for additional counsel for the Wolf
Island case of Missouri vs. Kentucky, for which
Noell was an attorney. The case was then before
the U. S. Supreme Court.

 
Reynolds, Thomas C. _f
This latter fact is revealed in Reynolds's

notation on the reverse side of the letter. The
notation also contains a quotation from his re-
ply on Jan. 25 to Noell's letter. He told Noell
that public opinion in Missouri seemed to be
overwhelmingly in favor of clinging to the

Union as long as the other border slave states

 

would do so, and then if all attempts at recon-
ciliation between the North and South failed,
Missouri and the other border states should
join those of the South.

Rhett, Robert Barnwell. Papers, 1838-1874.
Charleston, Charleston Co., S. C.

 

Robert Barnwell Rhett held many offices in
the state of S. C. and succeeded Calhoun in
the U. S. Senate. He advocated secession in
1850 and later led his state in withdrawing
from the Union. His son, R. B. Rhett, Jr.,

became editor of the Charleston Mercury in
1857, using his position to further his
father's career. The family surname was
originally Smith, but Rhett changed it to the

 

 
Rhett, Robert Barnwell =
less common name by which he wished to be known.
Among the correspondence in this collection
is a letter from Rhett to Franklin Harper
Elmore, dated Nov. 19, 1846, in which Rhett
expressed his determination not to become
involved in the elections of 1846. He would
not, therefore, oppose Elmore's efforts to
win a seat in the U. S. Senate.
William H., Branch wrote R. B. Rhett, Jr.
to subscribe to the Mercury. He noted that he
supported Rhett's policies and hoped S. C.

 

 
Rhett, Robert Barnwell

 

would once again return the elder Rhett to the
Senate (Aug. 26, 1858).

Milledge Luke Bonham, Governor of S. C.,
notified Rhett that the position for which
Rhett had recommended a nephew was no longer
under the jurisdiction of the governor's
office. The position had been transferred to

the Confederate government (Mar. 23, 1863).
Other correspondence includes business

letters from Rhett and a letter signed by

Rhett and five other congressmen supporting

 
Rhett, Robert Barnwell
Derrik Darby of S. C. for the position of
purser in the U. S. Navy (Dec., 1847).

The volume contains accounts from Rhett's
plantation near Darien, Georgia. The book
has been mutilated by the pasting of newspaper
clippings over the early pages and by the
removal of the last half of the volume.

 

Accounts remain for the period from 1853 to
1866. These records are most numerous for
1853 to 1854 and 1857 and 1858. Lists of
Slaves are included, and the last page of the

 
Rhett, Robert Barnwell
volume contains the "Rules and Regulations for

Farm Hands of the Freedmen's Bureau.” The

newspaper clippings run as late as 1874.
This volume records details of the work
conducted on this rice plantation.

County, Alabama

 

The James Rhodes Collection was formed when
the Michael J. Kenan papers were recataloged,
These items and the volume were found to have
no direct relationship to Kenan's papers and
therefore were pulled to form a separate collec

tion. Their provenance is not recorded.

An item dated June 18, 1865, is a contract
between Rhodes and his former slaves stipulating
the conditions governing the employment of the
emancipated Negroes. The contract was approved

 
Rhodes, James 2
on Nov. 10, 1565, by an agent of the Freedmen's
Bureau,

The remaining items are financial papers for
the years 1863-1866. An undated list of items
sold by either Rhodes or Kenan contains the
names of various members of the Mixon family. A
Dr. W. Mixon may be Winfield Henry Mixon who

 

later became presiding elder of the Greens-
borough District of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church in Alabama,

The volume is an account book recording the
financial affairs of Rhodes, Joseph Borden, and

 
Rhodes, James 3

A.M. Garber who apparently jointly leased
property in Monroe County, Ala., known as the
English Plantation. It appears that these men
liquidated their partnership early in 1852. The
book resumes in 1860 and contains Rhodes's per-
sonal accounts until 1866.

Melchi Rhodes (1827-1892) was a farmer who
lived near Salem Church in Lincoln County. As
a young man he worked in the gold fields of
California. After returning home from Califor-
nia he taught school at Gaston. In 1855 he

married Caroline Killian and settled near Salem
Church, He served in the Confederate army.
After the war he eventually amassed a good

estate. Biographical information is in William
L, Sherrill's Annals of Lincoln County North

Carolina (Charlotte, N.C., 1937), pp. 365-367.
The volume (118 pp.) was Melchi Rhodes's
Account Book, 1854-1902, which contains a
variety of personal and business financial
entries. One section consists of consecutive
entries during 1854-1860. The transactions
during 1854 were with the Quartz Gold Mining

Co, at Vestal's Ford and include payments for
goods and services, the latter apparently in-
volving slave labor. Names on the first page

appear to be birth records of three slaves.
The next two pages include entries for slaves

 
Rhodes, Melchi

 

hired out to a brick kiln. There may be other
entries for slave hiring. There are extensive
lists of notes during 1861-1902, so Rhodes was
apparently a source of credit to the community.
He was postmaster at Killian's Post Office
during at least 1882-1883 for which there are
entries, Agricultural labor accounts are

scattered about the pages.
Two items found inside the volume are a
receipt of 1797 and Rhodes' exemption from

military service in 1864,
