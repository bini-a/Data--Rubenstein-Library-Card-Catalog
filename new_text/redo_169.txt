Charleston Cotton Exchange. Papers. Charleston,
South Carolina

 

The Charleston Cotton Exchange, like other
exchanges in the South, controlled the local
cotton market and collected and made available
statistics of value to local merchants and to
the trade at large. It did not handle business

in cotton futures, the only future markets in
the U. S. being at the exchanges in New Orleans
and New York. Information about exchanges is
in W. Hustace Hubbard, Cotton and the Cotton

 

 
Charleston Cotton Exchange a
Market (New York and London, 1923).

The volumes contain statistics on the ship-
ping of cotton and other goods at Charleston
(1880-1905), cotton receipts at U. S. ports
(1899-1906), price quotations from several
markets in naval stores (1881-1886), and the
finances of the Exchange (1888-1938). The pa-
pers include groups of reports on the cotton
market at Charleston during 1936-1944 and 1948-
1950 and other items.

These papers came to the library with those

 

 
Charleston Cotton Exchange 3
of Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, cotton mer-
chants of Charleston. Messrs. Theophilus P.
Cheshire and Solomon M. Canaday were presidents
of the Exchange at various times during the
1930's to 1950's. The folder of cancelled
checks, 1939-1952, contains checks bearing names
of presidents during this period.

 

The chronological file of papers includes
minutes of meetings off the Board of Directors
on March 14, 19, 1884, financial statements of
1896-1898 and 1929-1930, and a letter of invi-

 
Charleston Cotton Exchange 4
tation in 1910 to prospective members. A let-
ter from President Cheshire in 1932 is a report
on the finances of the exchange and the state
of the cotton trade at Charleston. During 1948-
1950, there are numerous reports of daily sales
and inventories of cotton and frequent price
quotations. A number of monthly reports
record statistics on receipts and shipments of
cotton.

Statistics on domestic and international
shipments, inventories, etc, are in the

 

 
Charleston Cotton Exchange 5
Reports on Cotton Movement at Charleston, 1936-
1944 (mostly 1937-1941) that are filed in
separate folders.

The function of the Charleston Cotton Ex-
change as a provider of trading statistics to
the mercantile community is represented by
seven volumes. Marine News Clearances, No. 2

 

(1880, July-Aug., 1886), and No. 5 (1899, Sept.-
Feb., 1905) record shipping information: date
of clearance, nationality, rig, name of vessel,
master, déstination, cargo (types of goods and

i

their quantity), by whom cleared, and date of
departure. Clearances, No. 2, includes a List
of Steamships Loaded at Charleston for Foreign
Ports (1879, Sept.-Sept., 1885) that records
the number of bales of Sea Island and upland
cotton shipped, its destination, etc. This
list is on sheets attached to the front and

 

back pages of the volume. Marine Arrivals, No.
3 (1886, Aug.-Aug., 1892), No. 4 (1892, Sept.-
Aug, 1899), and No. 5 (1899, Sept.-Feb., 1905)
list date of arrival, nationality, rig, name
of vessel, master, place from which the ship

 
Cnarieston Cotton Exchange /

 

had come, cargo (quantities not given), and
consignee. The Weekly Cotton Receipts aft All
U. S. Ports (1899, March-Sept., 1906) includes
statistics for Galveston, New Orleans, Mobile,
Savannah, Charleston, Wilmington, Norfolk,
Baltimore, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and
other ports. These statistics include cumula-

tive totals and comparative figures for the
preceding year. Naval Stores, No. 2 (1881,
Sept.-July, 1886) contains price quotations
(several times daily) for rosin and turpentine

 
Charleston Cotton Exchange 8
on the markets at Wilmington, New York, London,
and Liverpool. Figures are more numerous for
Wilmington and New York. In 1883 price quota-
tions were begun for the market at Savannah,
and those for Liverpool were discontinued. On
the inside front cover is the Annual Statement
of Stocks, Receipts and Exports for the Year
Ended March 3lst, 1882, Computed from the Books
of The Produce Exchange, Wilmington, N. C.
(Cotton, turpentine, rosin, tar, and crude).
Four volumes record finances of the Exchange:

The Charleston Typographical Society (1820-Oct. 19,
1893), was a local benevolent association of printers.
Its membership included editors, clergymen, and publish-
ers, as well as others involved in the printing business.

When Local Union No. 43 of the International Typograph-
ical Union was reorganized in 1886, Society members

were also active in that union. Horace Greeley was made
an honorary member of the Society in1872, and the
organization later endorsed his nomination for the

 
Charleston Typographical Society

 

presidency of the United States.

Ihe microfilm contains copies of three
Minute Books of the Society. They are the first
edition, 1870-1879 and 1879 to 1893, and the
second edition, 1870-1890.

This material was lent by R. F. Britton,
Recording Secretary of the International

Typographical Union No. 43, Charleston, to be
filmed by the Duke Library.

CHASE, Harvey and Oliver
Letters and Papers,1825-1857. Fall
River,Mass. Sketch

 

fhese letters and papers regarding
the sale of cotton cloth were written
in 1825 and 1935 with the exception

of eleven pieces, apparently bearing no
connection to the earlier letters. The
later papers are dated 1857. Oliver
Chase recieved the communication tntil
July 1,3825, butiHarvey Chase was the

 
CHASE, Harvey and Oliver Sketch(2
recipient of the remainder of the letters
throughout 1835. During 1857 the communi-
cations were addressed to William Gris-
wold,Treasuret,at Rockville,Conn. No
personal information seems available

on Oliver and Henry Chase.

In business the Chases ar Chaces,as
it was sometimes spelled, were apparently
the chief officials of the "Troy Cotton
and Wool Manufactory" at FallRiver. Fall
River,once a part of Freetown, was

 
CHASE, Harvey and Oliver Sketch(3)
incorporated under the name of Troy in
1803. Hence it is possible that the name,
Troy,was given the town by the presence
oftthe Troy Cotton and Wool Manufactory;
it was a famous mill of old standings
which people often visited.

 

The papers are concerned with the sale
of goods made by the Troy Cotton and
Wool Manufactory. They tlanufactured
sheeting,plaids,checks, bed ticking,
Jeans,demins, calico, yarn, thread,wicks,

 
CHASE, Harvey and Oliver Sketch(4
etc.Sales were made to commission merchants
in Boston, Newport,Philadelphia,New York,
Baltimore etc.Lumber was bought from a
firm in Agusta,Maine for cards.The
collection also contains prices current,
reviews of the cotton crop,notices of

Partnership and reciepts for goods
shipped on coastwise vessels as well as
the Delaware and Hudson Canal

The value of the collection is doubt-
ful since the papers center around 1825
and 1835 thereby possessing no thread
of continuity. @

John Cheesborough lived at or near Asheville
during the 1870's and 1880's and was addressed
at nearby Biltmore in the 1890's. According to
a legal document of August 7, 1867, he and sev-
eral relatives were at that time residents of
South Carolina and were the heirs of the late
William Patton, a resident of Charleston in

Cheesborough, John 1A

John Cheesborough (1817-1903) is identified
from a collection of his papers in the Southern
Historical Collection at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was cashier
of the Bank of Charleston at Charleston and
Columbia, S. C. He was born at Georgetown, S.Q,
and died at Biltmore, N. C.

The central topic of the correspondence is
the disputed title to several islands of the
Florida Keys. They are usually referred to
collectively, but a letter of October 29, 1885,
specifies them as Key Vaccas, Boot Key, Grassy
Key, Duck Key, and Knight Key. Several other
islands are also mentioned. The five islands

lie together near the center of the Florida
Keys, and several are relatively extensive.
Their ownership is traced from 1824 when the
Spanish grantee sold them to an American. The
title changed hands a number of times and by the

 
Cheesborough, John 3
1870's was in dispute. The correspondence con-
cerns the joint claims of Moses C. Mordecai,
a merchant of Baltimore, the heirs of Charles
Howe, and the heirs of William Patton, and it
also includes their attorneys in Florida. The
correspondence ends without a final settlement
of the Claims, but it appears that one or more
of the above claims will result in a clear title’
John Cheesborough became an executor as well as
an heir of the Patton estate,

There is occasional comment about the con-
dition and value of the islands. For samples

On Mareh 7, 1872, Henry W. Howgate,
Acting Signal Officer in the War Department
at Washington, requested the right to maintain
a weather station and a telegraph line on an
unnamed mountain. The site is presumably

near Asheville where Howgate's letter is
addressed to Cheesborough.

Six manuscripts, 1903-1906, concern the
career of J.W. Cheesborough as a teacher in
the Philippine Islands. In 1903 he was

 
Cheesborough, John Z

 

addressed at Biltmore, N.C., when instructions
were sent about his teaching position and his
transportation to the islands. Several years
later there is a letter of recommendation from
his superior after he had taught a year in the
provincial high achool of Occidental Negros
(March 30, 1906). A "proclamation" of Nov. 27,
1906, satirizes the proclamation of Nov. 29
as Thanksgiving Day and the American adminis-
tration of the islands.
In 1900 Galveston, Texas, became the first

municipality to adopt a commission form of

about Edmund R. Cheesborough, who is described
as Galveston's most influential politician
during the first decade of its commission
government. This clipping was enclosed ina
letter of May 30, 1910, by Cheesborough in

which he commented upon his philosophy of life,
his role in civic affairs, his business activ-
ities, and his family. A second clipping also
accompanied the letter. It contains a report
from the grand jury at Galveston, May 26,1910,
a document for which Chgesborough took most of
the credit. =

State Troops in the brigade of Brig. Gen. John
Esten Cooke, Ransom's Division, Army of
Northern Virginia. On Jan. 15, 1863, he was
promoted to the rank of sergeant. His letters
treat conditions in N.C. and Va., the Battles
of Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, and Fort Sumter,
and his reactions to Gens. Cooke and Lee.

James Cherry's letters indicate his unwill-

Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc., cotton
merchants and exporters, traded principally with
Europe, especially Great Britain, Germany, and
the Netherlands. They also had a very limited
business with domestic textile mills, usually

in North Carolina and South Carolina. As owners
of the City Compress arid Warehouse Company, they
had storage and compressing facilities. Their
sources of cotton seem to have been primarily

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 2
within South Carolina with some purchasing also
in Georgia, North Carolina, and elsewhere. In
1932 the firm had capital of $60,000. The trial
balance of May, 1943, for the City Compress
and Warehouse Co. had a balance of $240,900.

The collection consists of alphabetically
arranged files of correspondence that include

 

both incoming and outgoing letters. These
files also contain many invoices and other re-
cords of financial transactions that have been

retained because there are no ledgers or other

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 3
account books. The papers date primarily be-
tween 1932 and 1945. An alphabetical list of
the files has been placed in the Inventory File.

Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc., began
under the name of Young, Cheshire & Co., Inc.,
on Aug. 24, 1932, as the successor of J. R.
Young & Co., Inc., that had been liquidated.

The new company was reorganized with increased
capital ($60,000), but it assumed the commit-
ments of the old business and continued with the

same personnel and manner of operation. Owner-

 

 

 

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 4
ship was limited to three persons. The wealthy
Mr. Sullivan had a substantial amount of the
stock, Ashmead F. Pringle,a minor part, and
Theophilus Parker Cheshire the balance. In
October, 1932, they purchaséd the City Compress
and Warehouse Company, one of the chief attrac-
tions being its acceptance as a delivery point
against New York futures. The warehouse was
operated under regulations of the federal govern
ment and had to show a net equity of $150,000.

This facility considerably strengthened the

 

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Candday, Inc. 5
owner's ability to function in theccotton mar-
ket. Previously they had leased the Army Base
Terminal Compress. (letter of Oct. 25, 1932, in
Harvey & Rhame File). The warehouse, also
known as South Carolina State Warehouse No. 2900
had a storage capacity of 50,000 bales. On
June 14, 1934, the company's name was changed
to Cheshire, Sullivan & Co., Inc., and again in
the mid-1940's to Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday,
Inc. The firm continued in business until at

least 1971. Solomon M. Candday was one of the

 

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 6
later owners. Information about the company's
history comes from several letters from various
files, and copies of these letters have been
placed for convenience in a folder in the first
box.

The files outline the structure and extent
of the company's domestic and foreign operations.

 

The letters and accounts record its dealings
with agents, cotton merchants, textile mills,
the New York Cotton Exchange, insurance compa='
nies, banks, agencies of the federal government

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 7

 

and of South Carolina, commission merchants,
shipping companies, railroads, ,and others.
Business included the puuchase, consignment,
storage, compressing, and sale of cotton, and
also hedging in the speculative market of cot-
ton futures. The cotton merchants ranged from
operators of crossroad stores to brokers in

large cities. Correspondence with the Larger
merchants both in the U. S. and abroad involved
the condition of the cotton crop and markets

throughout the South and Southwest.

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 8

 

The files vary considerably in quantity and
quality of content, and they are incomplete,
although extensive, for the period of 1932-1945.
Many files record mainly the details of pur-
chasing, transporting, storing, compressing,
and selling of cotton. The routine correspond-
ence with its details of transactions was re-

tained since there are no ledgers or other
account books in which this information is
available. The files also delineate the geo-

graphic distribution of the company's customers

 
 

Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 9
and sources of cotton. In addition, there
is as yet no other similar set of papers here.
The business papers of Alexander Sprunt & Son,
a much larger firm of cotton exporters, con-
sist primarily of account books.

Several domestic files are worthy of note.
An exceptional one is that for Corn, Schwarz &
Co., commission merchants of New York City, in
which the correspondence (1932-1933 and 1936-
1938) is especially numerous and descriptive

of domestic and international market conditions,

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 10

 

the related economic situation, the cotton crop
in the U. S., and the agricultural policies of
Congress and the administrations of Presidents
Hoover and Roosevelt. They handled the compar
ny's trading in cotton futures on the New York
Cotton Exchange and also foreign transactions.
There is a limited file for the Exchange (1938-
1946). Other domestic files do not approach the
quality of the papers for Corn, Schwarz & Co.,
but valuable letters are scattered about the
collection, including the alphabetical miscel-

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 11
laneous files. Trading outside the South Atlan-
tic states is illustrated in business with Fin-
berg Trading Co. of Texas (1945) and with George
H. McFadden & Bro, (1932-1945) and Anderson,
Clayton & Co. (1944-1949) that had agencies in

a number of states. The activities of McFadden
and Anderson, Clayton & Co. were also noted by
Corn, Schwarz & Co. Banking assistance came
from the South Carolina National Bank (1932-
1945) and the First National Bank of Atlanta

(1936-1938). However, information about banking

 

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 12
—or any other topic--may appear in any file,
since the owners discussed problems with various
customers and associates. Mathewes, Crews &
Lucas, cotton brokers of Greensboro, handled
sales to textile mills in North Carolina (1936-
1945). There was considerable business with

the Commodity Credit Corporation (1936-1946).
Its program for the purchase of cotton resulted
in considerable routine ~correspondence in 1944-
1945 when the company was an approved purchasing
agent. Papers of the City Compress and Ware-

 

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 13
house Co. are scattered about the collection,
but there is also a file for it.

Several files for foreign companies contain
valuable correspondence, some in considerable
quantity. They include the papers for: C.
Edwin Hirschfeld of Bremen, Germany (1932-1933
and 1936-1939); G. H. Hoyer of Rotterdam, Neth-

 

erlands (1932-1938); J. M. Servaes of Liverpool

(1932-1942); and Messrs. J. Smith & Co. of

Manchester (1932-1933 and 1937-1938) in England.
Cheshire and Canaday were both presidents

 
Cheshire, Sullivan & Canaday, Inc. 14
of the Charleston Cotton Exchange for which
there is also a collection.

Photographs of the City Compress & Ware-
house Co. are in the file for Maps, Blueprints,
and Pictures.

Francis Rawdon Chesney (1789-1872), British
general, is noted for his explorations of the
Euphrates River and for the foundation of an
overland route to India. His inspection and re-
port on Egypt were important in persuading Fer-

dinand de Lesseps of the feasibility of the Suez
route foracanal., Chesney explored the Euphra-
tes in 1831 and then returned to England to urge
the use of this route for access to India. Bri-
tish officials were interested enough to appro-

 
 

Oriate funds for a second venture, and in 1835-
1836 Chesney returned to Turkey, transported two
steamers to the Euphrates, assembled them, and
successfully navigated the river to the Persian
Gulf. From 1856 to 1872 he was involved with
attempts to establish a railway in this region.
Chesney published several works, Sens which are

Dictionary of National Biography.

This manuscript volume is entitled "Observa-

tions on Persia as an Ally, and the Cheapest as
well as Most Important Frontier Line of Our In-
dian Empire." It is not signed, but page 108
bears the notation, "Colonel: Chesney's observa-
tions on Persia as an Ally." This document is
also undated. The pages, however, have water-
marks of 1831. In additon, Chesney discusses

Abbas Meerza (or Mirza), heir apparent to the
Persian throne, who died in 1833. The date of
this manuscript, therefore, appears to be with-
in 1831-1833. These years coincide with his
first exploration of the Euphrates and his sub-

 
=

sequent agitation of this question in London. A
comment on page five indicates that this docu-
ment was designed for official consideration.
The manuscript came to the library with the cor-
respondence of Sir Harford Jones Brydges to
James Willis, 1799-1804 (the James Willis MSS.)
Chesney's "Observations" comprise 108 pages
of which 104 are text. This work is a detailed
analysis of Persia with recommendations for Bri-
tish foreign policy in this region, Chesney ar.
gues that Persia should be strengthened as a
buffer state between India and Russia. The

manuscript is very legible, and marginal nota-
tions on each page identify topics so that they
may be easily located. The following list of
topics, arranged generally in the order of the
text, will indicate the detail and comprehensive
ness of Chesney's analysis of Persian affairs:
introductory argument; Russo-Turkish relations
from 1717; Persia- population: , geography, go-
vernment, royal family, dissension within the
State, revenue, and foreign policy; a similar
analysis of the principality of Shiraz with com-
ments on lesser provinces; analysis of the Per-

 

 
 

sian army; possibility and implications of 4us-
Sian domination of Persia; strategic importance
of Persia; consideration: of the region from the
point of view of military operations; boundaries;
position of the royal family, especially of Fath
Ali Shah and Abbas Mirza, the heir apparent;
present expenses for a regiment of Persian in-

fantry; recommendations for strengthening the
Persian government and army; undesirability of
Afghanistan instead of Persia as a buffer state
for India; transportation and commerce; recom-
mendations for British policy toward Persia and

 
— hE)
also Baghdad, a part of Turkey; recommendations

for financing this Persian policy and its rela-
tion to a reduction of similar expenditures in
India,

James Chesnut (Jan. 18, 1815-Feb 1, 13385),
lawyer, planter, senator, Confederate soldier,
was born ad Camden, S.C. His father owned
large plantations (said to have aggreagted five
square miles) near Camden, sat in the state leg-

islature, and was intendant of Camden, 13806-
15607. He was educated at Princeton, read law
at Charleston under James Louis Petigru, was: ad-
mitted to the bar in 1837, and commenced the
practice of law in Camden shortly afterwards.

 
CHESPNUT, James, Jr, Sketch 2
Chesgnut entered the lower house of the
General Assembly in 1840, and with the exception

of two sessions, 1846-47, 1848-49, he was re-
turned to that body until 1852. For the next
six years he was a member of the state Senate
and its president from 1856-1858. An ardent ad-
vocate off secession, ChesgZnut was sent to Nash-
ville in 1850 and was elected to the U.S. senate
in 1858 where his oratory made him a conspicuous
defender of Southern rights.

When secession became imminent, Chesgnut

 

 
CHES@NUT, James, Jr, Sketch 3
resigned his seat in the Senate. In the South
Carolina convention he was a member of the com-
mittee which drafted the ordinance of secession.
In the Provisional Congress of the Confederate
States, he was a member of the committee which
drafted the permanent constitution. As an aide
on the staff of Gen. Beauregarde, he and S. D.

 

Lee bore the messages to Anderson demanding the
evacuation of Fort Sumter. Chesfnut was an aide
to Beauregarde at First “anassas. Subsequently

he was a member of the executive council of

 
CHES#NUT, James, Jr, Sketch 4
South Yarolina, but resigned in Oct,1862,to be-
come an aide on the staff of President Davis.
Desire for field service caused him to resign
and he was appointed (April 23, 1864) brigadier
general in command of the resefve forces of
South Carolina.

Ches§nut was active in the reconstruction

 

of South Carolina. He was president of the con-
vention of 1867 which protested against militar
rule and was a delegate to the national Democra

tic convention in 1868. In the campaign of 1876

 
CHESPNUT, James, Jr, Sketch 5
he was chairman of the Sershaw county Democrati
national convention. His death occurred at “aar
field, his plantation near Camden, in 1885.
This small collection contains five letters
from James J. Deas to James Chesfnut and one
which is evidently the draft of a reply from
Chesfnut. The correspondence deals with the sale
of a plantation, of cotton, and the settlement
of some debts. The letters are valuable in that
they reveal a great deal about the business af-

fairs of Chestnut and the private papers of

Chesgfnut are rare.

of the citizens of Marion District, 8. C., ask-
ing for the apprehension of certain persons who
were considered dangerous to the community for
arousing discontent among the slaves and for
théir hostility to the government. (May 2, 1862)

car Committee, and probably others. His

bibliography includes works relating to South
Africa, India, America, Turkey, China, slavery
and the slave trade, the Atlantic cables,

Chesson, Frederick William

The papers primarily concern the humanitarian
interests and efforts of Chesson and his
associates relative to various countries and
colonies in Europe, Asia, and Africa. They
attempted to influence British foreign policy
and colonial administration in behalf of the
welfare of a number of national and tribal

 

populations, and they were always interested in
suppressing slavery and the slave trade.

In Europe - Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria
were discussed during 1878-1880. The Armenians

 
Chesson, Frederick William

 

were also involved in the Turkish situation.
Relations with France were noted on several
occasions in 1877-1885, usually with regard to
either Egypt or Madagascar, The Madagascar
references of 1883-1887 include three letters
of 1883 from Ravoninahitriniarivo, foreign
minister and nephew of the Queen's husband and
chief minister,

The Asian affair that especially disturbed
Chesson and his friends was the war with
Afghanistan for which comment was extensive

 
 

Chesson, Frederick William 6
during 1878-1881. Indian matters were also
noted in 1882 and 1884, There is a good letter
about conditions on Mauritius in 1884 and
another reference in 1877. Borneo was noted
in 1882,

Relative to Africa there are numerous manu-
scripts. There are several for Sierra Leone

in 1858, but most of the many references con-
cerned South Africa and the native policy in
the Cape Colony, Natal, and adjacent areas
during 1872-1884, The Basutos, Pondos, and

 
 

Chesson, Frederick William 7
Zulus, including their king, Cetewayo, were
discussed. Letters from two residents of Natal
have special interest, J. W. Welborne was a
principal promoter of a railway construction
scheme about which he wrote in 1872, 1874, and
1877. His letters and several of Francis
Reginald Statham. of the Natal Witness revealed

factional strife in that colony. Bechuanaland
was noted in 1884 and 1887.

There are scattered references to slavery
and the slave trade, 1877-1884, in various parts

 
 

Chesson, Frederick William
of the world.

There are several references to the politi-
cal situation in Britain, 1878, 1880, and 1886,
the Liberal Party in 1878-1879, parliamentary
reform in 1878, and the depressed economy in
1878.

This collection consists chiefly of Let

ters about personal affairs by and to Rachel
Susan (Bee) Cheves (18 -1884) and her rele-
tives and in-laws. ~

 

She was the daughter of Mary Rebecca
Richardson (1797-ca. 1828) by her first husband,
Richard M. Bee, of Charleston, 8.C. After 1817
the mother married John Turquand McCord, who
lived till after 1826. Sometime in the 1820's
or 1830's Rachel, orphaned, was reared by her

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 2
uncle and aunt-in-law, Col. and Mrs. Edward
Richardson, Jr,

In the 1830's or 1840's Rachel married a
distant cousin, Dr. John Richardson Cheves
(1815-ca. 1869). The follOwing two children
are known to have been born to this union, but

 

the order of births is unknown:

1. Edward ("Eddie and Eddy") Richardson
Cheves, a Confederate captain who was killed
in the Peninsula Campaign, June 27, 1862; and

2. Mary Eilzabeth ("Minna and Min") Cheves.
Ca. 1865 she married her first cousin, Joseph

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 3
Cheves Haskell (1843- _), a late captain

 

_. in the Confederate Army. He was still liv-

.°. dng in 1884; she, in 1911. They had sever-
al children, including Elise Haskell (b. ca.
1878), who married Joseph Marshall and had
issue,

Rachel and her family lived mainly in var-
ious places in 8,¢. and Ga. She visited her
Dulles in-laws in Philadelphia: in ca, 1848 and
ca. 1868. Ca. 1882 she was living in Sewanee,
Tenn. She later moved to St. Mary's Parish,
La., where she died on Nov. 15, 1884.

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 4
Her husband was the son of Langdon Gheves I
(1776-1857) and Mary Elizabeth (Dulles) Cheves
(1789-1836). Some biographical and genealog-
ical information about him appears in the The
South Carolina Historical and Genealogical
Magazine, XXXV, 79-95 and 130-152. Instead of

 

 

practicing his profession he engaged in agri-
cultural pursuits,

He is often mentioned in The Official Re-
cords of the War of the Rebellion; ¢.g., Ser.
I, Vol. XIV, pp. 616 and 700; Vol. XXVIII, Part
II, pp. 340-342, 357-358, and 386; and Vol. ».~.

An enthusiastic Confederate supporter, he
was in charge of boom construction in Charles-
ton Harbor in 1862. The next year his work on
an incendiary shell attracted the attention of
Confederate Gen. Josiah Gorgas. Cheves corres-

 

ponded with Confederate generals. Beauregard,
Thomas Jordon, and Hugh W. Mercer, The first
named general commended his efforts on Feb. 24,
1864. See O.R., Ser. I, Vol. XXXV, Part I,

p. 641.

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 6

In 1865. Cheves was placed on special duty
as a Confederate surgeon. Ca. 1866 he received
a presidential pardon and regained possession
of his property. This was largely due to the
persistent efforts of his uncle, Joseph Heatly
Dulles (1795-1876).

 

A multitude of subjects are mentioned in
this collection; for instance, relatives, =;
deaths, sickness, weather, crops, the Civil War,
Reconstruction, slavery, and genealogy. His-
torically speaking, the most important items
are letters and a statement of ca, 1866 by Mrs.

Smythe (1842-19 ); and the woeful circumstan-
ces of Columbia after the fire.

On Mar. 18, 1865, she mentions the capture
of nearly all of Capt. Parker's Co. (Confeder-
ate). Columbia was left in the hands of Neg-
roes, all armed, and of any vagabonds or strag-

 

glers who chose to stay, but some Confederates
returned, disarmed the Negroes, punished many
of them, shot some of them, and gradually re-
stored order,

On Oct, 24 she states that Alexander Cheves
Haskell, her 6 was elected to the

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 10
S.C, House of Representatives; that it seems .
impossible to raise a cavalry co. in the Abbe-
ville District; that it is hard to get work out
of the Negroes; that Judge Wardlow said that
Wade Hampton III was not to be pardoned, in
spite of his having taken the "Damnasty Oath";

 

that Hampton will almost surely be elected
governor of 8.C.; that Duff Calhoun has visited
Abbeville; and that Mr. Middleton, by being par-
doned, has saved $200,000 worth of property.

On Nov. 3, 1865, she mentions different
people, including Wade Hampton IV and Confeder-

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 11
ate Gen. E,P. Alexander. On the 20th she men-
tions fear that plantation Negroes will rebel
about Christmastime. On the 26th she mentions
the engagement of her daughter to Joseph Cheves
Haskell.

Sometime after the Civil War, perhaps in

 

1868, Rachel and her sister-in-law, Anna Maria
(Cheves) Huger, visited their Dulles relatives
in Philadelphia. Rachel discusses the subject
in a letter to her daughter, Mary Elizabeth
(Cheves) Haskell. The Dulles are happy, pros-
perous, and hospitable.

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 12
“There is an undated letter from Rachel to
her younger half-sister, Mary Elizabeth (McCord)
Hampton, wife of Christopher F. Hampton III.
(Note: The letters in this collection signed
"M,E, Hampton" are by this Mrs. Hampton. She is
nick-named "Bet" and "Bett.")They deal chiefly

 

with the illness of the addressee's daughter,
Ann, (Note: Both mother and daughter appear to
have died in or about the 1840's.) Dr. Cheves,
himself 111, prescribes for Ann,

Dr. Cheves writes 21 personal letters about
personal affairs to his wife between 1848 and

J.C, Pemberton, and discusses his work on the
defense of Charleston Harbor.

On July 7 he discusses the death of their
son,

On Dec, 27, 1864, he mentions William Neyle
Habersham,

On Feb, 11, 1865, he writes to his wife
that he is turning over his money to her, and
that she and their “oe are to spend it as

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 14
fast as they can. By this time Dr. Cheves is
a Confederate surgeon and chief of a hospital
at Adam's Run, 8.C. He has 14 tents, enough
for 200 men.

On March 15 he writes that he is the Chief
of the only field hospital in Gen... J.E, Johne:

 

ston's Army. He does not know where the army
has gone. Everybody who returns is exempt, a
deserter, or, like himself, on special duty.
On Apr. 7 he writes that he is trying to
establish a hospital at Chesterville, 8.C,
On Aug. 19 he discusses his application

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 15

of Georgia and his call upon all citizens to
take the amnesty oath.
On Oct. 6 he mentions Gen. Howard, U.S.
Attorney Gen. James Speed, Gov. Johnson, and
pardons. Cheves is trying to get a pardon, to

 

repossess his property, and to negotiate a loan.
He eventually attains the first two objectives.
He writes an undated letter, saying that,
by order of Gen. Howard, he has repossessed his
property. A lady who saw President Andrew John-
son reports him as saying that Cheves! pardon

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 16
is being prepared. Cheves mentions Joseph
Heatly Dulles (1795-1876).

Other undated letters mention Confederate
Gen. R.S. Riply, electric torpedoes, Gen. Pem-
berton, 0.0. Howard, and Rufus Saxton.

Cheves writes on July 2, 1862, to his bro-

 

ther, Langdon Cheves. II ( 1814-1863), about
the recent death of the writer's son. He men-
tions C,S,ARepresentative W.P. Miles of S.C. as
being one of the best friends of the family.
Writing to his daughter perhaps ca. 1865,
Cheves says that President Andrew Johnson °

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 17
Wwants to conciliate the South." Cheves has
written to Mrs. Anne E. Young, of Hyattsville,
Md., asking her to see the President on his be-
half-and to include him in the amnesty proclam-
ation. Cheves mentions a letter in which he
had asked his wife to write to Gen. Howard,

 

Commissioner of the Freedman's Bureau, in order
to regain possession of his property from the
Bureau.

Edward Richardson Cheves writes on Nov. 24,
1861, to his mother, mentioning camp life,
the possibility of getting a furlough, the fail-

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 18
ure of a horse, Gen. Alfred Cumming, and
pickets,

Thirty-seven Confederate soldier's person-
al letters, addressed mainly to his parents,
are written by Joseph Cheves Haskell (1843-_),
son of Charles Thomson Haskell (1802-1873) and

 

Sophia Lovell (Cheves) Haskell (1809-1881).
Alexander Cheves Haskell, older brother of
Joseph, married (second), in 1870, Alice Van
Yeveren Alexander (18 -1902), sister of Edward
Porter Alexander.
Joseph begins his series of:lettérs on-.,

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 19
Fed, 28, 1861, in Columbia, 8.C., where, with
his older brother, John, he is enrolled as a
student in 8. C, College, He is glad that there
is no chance of immediate war, but he is "with
such a blood thirsty set here at college." He
discusses his personal debts and student life.

 

On May 12, still a student, he reports that
the Federal blockading ship at Charleston, the
U.Ss.5S, Niagra, is off the bar, and that a rifle
cannon was being mounted on the C.S.8. Lady
Davis.to test its effect upon the enemy vessel.
The Btudents at the college are doing nothing.

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 20
Joseph's Confederate Army letters discuss

a variety of topics, camp life, sickness, cloth-

ing, food, blankets, tents, troop movements,

morale, horses, battles and prospects of bat+‘~»

tles, and skirmishes, as well as personal and

social affairs.

 

On March 19, 1862, Joseph writes about Gen.
G.W. Randolph's Richmond Howitzers; and Cobb's
Legion. News reached the camp of Randolph's
appointment as Secretary of War. William Thom-
son Haskell (1837-1863), Joseph's older brother,
knew Randolph well “@ confident that he

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) =
would fill the place well. So were the offi-
cers in Joseph's regiment, especially since
Randolph had called it the finest regiment that
he had seen in the service.

On Apr. 29 Joseph mentions Ewell's Divi-
sion, He says,"People seem to think that

 

McClelland -sic; is afraid of Gen. ¢J.E,.; John-
ston and that There will be no fight down here. "
This pertains to the Peninsula Campaign (1862),
as does Haskell's letter of May 15, wherein he
states that Federal gunboats have shelled

"White House," the estate of Col. W. H. F. Lee,

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 22
gon of Gen. f.E. Lee, near Richmond. H@ men-
tions the C,S8.8, warp nt a; Gens. J.E, Johnston
and Beauregard; an e possibility that France
will intervene on the Confederate side.

On June 9 he mentions Federal and Confed-
erate troop dispositions and the death of Con-

 

federate Gen, Turner Ashby.

Haskell discusses his application for a
Cadetship on Oct.7 and states that Gén. J.E,
Johnston has not improved as fast as expected
from his wounds,

On Oct, 21 he mentions Confederate Gen,

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 23
A.R. Lawton as having been wounded in some of
the late battles.

On Nov. 21, Joseph writes that his comrades
are quartered outside in the snow. He mentions
his brothers, Alexander and John. Joseph and
John spent an evening at the home of Mrs. Lydia

 

(McLane) Johnston, wife of Gen. Joseph E., where
they met Mrs. Charlotte Maria (Cross) Wigfall.
She had known their parents in 8.C. before their
marriage.

A letter of ca. 1862 mentions genealogy,
the Lewis family, and ry Hampton IV.

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 24
On Jan.1, 1866, Joseph says that his bro-
ther John has been offered a position as Gen.
G.W, Smith's Chief of Artillery. Joseph men-
tions the success achieved by Gen. Braxton
Bragg's Army in the first part of the Battie of
Stone River (1862-1863); and the Battle of

 

Fredericksburg (1862). He mentions his brother,
William Thompson Haskell (1837-1863), in an in-
teresting sidelight on Confederate social life
and customs.

On Jyly 8 he mentions the death of his
brother, Willie, in the Battle of Gettysburg

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 25
(i863). Joseph himself apparently fought there
too. At any rate, he is with the retreating
Southern Army at Hagerstown, Md., about 10
miles from the Potomac River, now impassable,
Lack of ammunition, he says, forced the army
back, but he expects there will be another as-

 

vance as soon as there is a supply of ammuni-
tion,

On Jyly 18 he discusses the deaths of his
uncle, Langdon Cheves II (1814-1863), and his
brother, Charles Thompson Haskell (1835-1863),
in the Battle of eG Wagner (1863).

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 26

On July 26, 1863, he writes from Culpeper,
Va., where he is Adj. of Alexander's Battery.
His predecessor was dismissed for cowardice,
The outfit's horses have been much reduced by
battle losses and those left are almost starved
to death. The number of soldiers is greatly

 

reduced, the morale of the army is low, and
everyone feels how disastrous to the South the
defeat at Gettysburg was. He mentions Gen.

James Longstreet.
In a letter of Oct. 20 Joseph mentions

Gen. R.E. Lee. |

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 275
On Nov. 5 he writes about supplies, troop
movements, and the Chattanooga and Knoxville
campaigns (1863). He mentions U. S. Gen. A. E.
Burnside and these C. S. units: Bragg's Army;
Hood's Div.; the Brigs. of Kershaw, Jenkins,
and Walker; and Alexander's Battalion, his own

 

organization. Col. Alexander was Gen. James
Longstreet's Chief of Artillery in the Knoxville
Campaign. A few days earlier Joseph's battalion
had been shelling the U. S. Army camp from Look
out Mountain. Now it is being sent to surprise
Burnside in Knoxville, but there are too few

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 28
Confederate troops at either Chattanooga or
Knoxville. Railroad transportation to Knoxville
is limited, rain-swollen rivers have made
bridges unsafe, and horses were hard to obtain.
The battalion's problem of procuring horses is
discussed in some detail. Joseph thanks his
mother for food sent to him and praises the

 

S. C. Aid Association for sending not less than
20,000 lbs. of victuals.

A letter of Nov. 29, 1863, by Joseph dis-
cusses the Knoxville Campaign. U. S. General

William P. Sanders was killed in combat on Nov. 18.

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 29
During the truce Alexander had a pleasant dis-
cussion with some Union offieers. After the
repulse, Longstreet was ordered to fall back and
Join Bragg. But Bragg directed Longstreet to
join him at Dalton, Ga., if practicable, and,

if not, to retreat to Va.

 

On Dec, 2,Haskell says that Alexander wants
to take Knoxville before U.S. Gen. G.H. Thomas
can send a large force there from Chattanooga.

On Dec, 7, Haskell regrets Longstreet's
unwillingness to take Knoxville, which could
have been taken, “6 is lost to the

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 30
South. There are few Confederate sympathizers
there and the Southern troops have behaved
shamefully toward them. Except for Alexander's
Battalion, Longstreet's Army is undisciplined.
He has heard of Bragg's relief from command of
the Army ‘of Tenn,, but erroneously believes that

 

"Mr, Davis has perhaps had his eyes opened at
last," and that Longstreet would have the com-
mand. He desires that J.E. Johnston succeééd
Bragg. (Note: That is what happened.) Haskell
states that he has previously received his ap-
pointment as a Cadet, but by now he is Adj. of

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 31
Alexander's Battalion.

On Mar.7, 1864, he writes that Alexander
has been made Brig. Gen, He mentions the need
for food and silverware; and Longstreet.

On July 8 he writes on a piece of captured
Union stationery from H.Q,., First Army Corps

 

(Longstreet's Corps), Petersburg, Va. He has
not received any mail from home for a long time,
because communications have been cut. Gen.Alex-
ander has gone to Ga. to recover from his wounds
Haskell has temporarily assumed authority to
handle some of the “oe He mentions food

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) « 32
and food’ prices.

On Jan. 2, 1865, he writes that Confederate
Army morale is good, and that the recent Union
repulse at Ft. Fisher cheered the despondent.
But, he continues, Confederate stock is very low
in Richmond among the Jews, speculators, etc.

 

On Feb. 15 he complains sharply of Col. Ca-
bell, Acting Chief of Corps Art. in the absence
of Alexander. (Note: Gen, W,N. Pendleton later
succeeded Cabell.) He hears that Gen. Sherman
is in S.C,

On Feb. 25 he expresses confidence in the

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 33
Confederate cause,

On Mar. 5 he mentions the fall of Columbia
and says that Richmonders are dreadfully panicky
on the subject of evacuating the city. He men-
tions the defeat of Confederate Gen. J.A. Early
in the Battle of Waynesboro (1865); and criti-

 

Cizes him severely.

A letter of ca. 1865 mentions Wade Hampton
IV and Hampton's Legion, It also states that ~
the ©.5.A. is done for.

There are two personal letters of 1847 by
Mary Elizabeth a ya wife of

 
Cheves, Rachel Susan (Bee) 34

Hampton estate east of Columbia, 3.C.,: to her
aunt-in-law and foster mother, Mary Elizabeth
(Turquand) Richardson (d. 1848). The letter
discusses personal affairs and relatives, in-

 

cluding "Aunt" Caroline Hampton, sister of the
Gen.; and Wade Hampton II.

Westmoreland Co., Va., and educated at West
Point where he graduated in 1837. He became a
Lieut. of Dragoons and served in the Mexican
War. He entered the Confederate service in

1861, served on Lee's staff, and became a brig.
general. After the war he lived in Columbus,
Ga., where he died in 1879. (See L.G. Tyler

This collection is especially concerned
with the consular service in its various
phases between 1897 and 1901, but there are a
fair number of items, some of them of value
and interest, before that date.

Among the earlier items is a facsimile
of a letter written in 1808 by Mary Lamb to
Mrs. Hazlitt with a postscript by Charles
Lamb. The letter mentions Godwin, Coleridge,
Hazlitt and others. It has been published in

Letters of Charles : Lamb, edited by

There are lists, some in great detail,
of commodity prices, as well as briefer men-
tions, in a number of years between 1808 and
1883 from Washington, Baltimore, and a few

 

other places.

Among other items in this earlier period
is a lengthy report by a committee, no place
or names given, on the development and appli-
cation of manure to corn and tobacco lands,

"our much used and r land"; some original

 
Chilton, Robert S.,. Jr. 3
poems and clippings of poems between 1860 and
1870; a mention of the Chicago Fire of 1871
and its disastrous effects; a record of
patent of Dec. 14, 1881, to the state of Miss.
for swamp and overflowed lands, signed by the
Commissioner of the General Land Office of

 

the U. S., May 10, 1882; an account of the

Chilton, Robert S., Jr,
military administration in Algeria,

Between 1897 and 1901 there are many
letters requesting information concerning
consuls and applications for positions in the
consulates of many countries. A fairly large
number of the letters deal in more or less

 

detail with the difficulties in certain con-
sulates, with the chaotic condition of the
service in various cities throughout the
world; the housing problem, notably in Japan
in Jan., 1899; the disparity between salaries
in comparable a i the low salaries in

 
Chilton, Robert S., Jr. 5
general and the small allowances for clerks
and assistants; the incompetence and care-
lessness of certain consuls; the Adams Bill
of 1899 and the attitude of Congress and of
certain senators toward the need for far-
reaching reforms; the attempts of Senator

 

Burrows of Michigan and Hanna of Ohio to in-
fluence the appointment of consuls.

A rather large number of the letters con-
cern U. S. commerce. Some are from American
companies wishing to establish trade with

certain foreign — © such as Australia,

 
Chilton, Robert S., Jr, 6
China, Japan, the Philippines and the West
Indies; others from consuls, sometimes confi-
dential, concerning trade with Argentina,
Cuba and Porto Rico, Candda, Italy, Germany,
China and the East. One from Horta, Fayal
(Azores), Feb. 20, 1899, compares the quality

 

of German and American imports with its effect
upon American trade. One from Rotterdam, May
1, 1901, speaks in some detail of the dis-
honesty of some German shippers and the care-
lessness or worse of some American consuls in
Germany toward the ¢e disinfection of

 
Chilton, Robert S., Jr. 7
German hides and rags.

Some of the most interesting letters are
from Japan and China by Hubbard T. Smith,
consul in Canton, who knew Chilton well
enough to call him "Bob" and to sign himself
i Hub . "

 

There are some letters which are con-
cerned with the foreign relations of the U. Ss
one from Montevideo, July 14, 1898, enclosing
Clippings from newspapers about the attitude
of Argentina in the Spanish-American War; an-
other from a? ia 25, 1899, speaking

 
Chilton, Robert S., Jr. 8
of the effect of the war upon the consulate
in Spain.

A few items deal with American politics
and government, among them a letter from John
Hopley of Bucyrus, Ohio, enclosing clippings
from The Buéyrus Journal and the Free Press

 

on politics in Michigan in 1900, the Demo-
cratic Party in Kentucky, and the attitude

of Gov. Roosevelt of New York toward the
vice-presidency; lettersof Sept. 13 & 16,
1898 about quarantine in Texas against yellow
fever and smallpox; ry one from Durango,

May 27, 1899, speaks of the persecution of

 

missionaries in China; andther from Acapulco,

Aside from. the = already mentioned,

 
Chilton, Robert S., Jr. 13
the names of various prominent men occur in
these letters, some more than once. Among
these are James Burrell Angell, minister to
Turkey, in letters from Constantinople, Aug.

Chittenden Family. Papers. East River, New
Haven Co., Conn.

 

The most significant and largest segment of
this collection is the correspondence between
Amanda (Badger) Chittenden (Mrs. Samuel C.) of
East River, Connecticut, and her sons Samuel
H. ("Sam") and George B. ("Ben") while Sam was

employed by the Union Pacific Railroad and Ben
was at Yale and later when he was also in the
West with the expedition led by Dr. Ferdinand
V. Hayden, geologist with the United States

 
Chittenden Family 2

Geological Survey, to explore, map, and describé
the natural history of the western territories.
Both sons graduated in engineering from Yale,
Ben specializing in topography. There are
student letters during 1868-1871 and also an
autograph album, 1868-1870. The Chittendens

 

were genteel but poor, and Sam largely financed
Ben's education at Yale. It appears that Mrs.
Chittenden made most of her sons' clothing for
years after they were employed on their own.
Although an Annie is frequently mentioned in

 
Chittenden Family 3

 

the correspondence, it appears that she was
either a relative or a maid who lived with the
Samuel C. Chittendens.

There are several letters from Amanda's
cousin, Rosetta C. Wilson (Mrs. Joseph B.),
who wrote first from Indianapolis on Jan. 21,

1863, and later from Leavenworth, Kansas. In
her first letter she mentions Amanda having
written to her that Governor William A. Buck-
ingham had "appointed her forty-ninth birthday
as a day of Thanksgiving throughout the state

 
Chittenden Family

 

of Connecticut." There is no indication,
though, of why Mrs. Chittenden was being so
honored. In that same letter Mrs. Wilson re-
ported that her brother Jones had had to flee
his home in Independence, Missouri, and she
stated that Amanda in her quiet New England

home had no conception of the terrible state
of things in Missouri and the other border
states.

By February, 1869, Sam was in Nebraska with
the Union Pacific Railroad, and he continued

 
Chittenden Family 5

in its employment at least through 1874, there
being letters through all these years from
various western states. Ben was employed early
in 1872, the year after he graduated from Yale,
as a topographer by James Terry Gardiner, a
geographer with the U.S. Geological and Geo-

 

graphical Survey of the Territories that was
headed by Dr. Hayden. Ben continued to write
from that employment through the fall of 1876.
Since the correspondence is incomplete, the
exact dates of the employment of the two

 
Chittenden Family

 

brothers cannot be determined.

As Mrs. Chittenden states ina letter and
as the letters of the Chittenden brothers show,
they were quite different men. Ben was the
social one of the two, and his letters are much
more detailed and interesting than those of

Sam. Perhaps the story of most general in-
terest among those that Ben wrote to his
mother about his experiences in the West was
about his conversation with Mrs. Eliza Young,
the ex-wife of Brigham Young. She said she

 
Chittenden Family 7

had been his nineteenth wife, and in 1873 she
was on a tour lecturing about the Mormons and
telling her personal story. Sam's most inter-
esting account is of the results of a deep
snow in Wyoming early in 1872. He said it
took three hundred shovelers on a work train

 

two weeks to clear the one hundred miles of
track between Laramie and Rawlins so that the
trains could get through, and then the eight
trains that got through Rawlins became stuck
fifteen miles west of there.

 
Chittenden Family 8

 

Mrs. Chittenden often mentions family mem-
bers, especially her two sisters, Caroline
Washburn and Clarissa Badger, and members of
their families. Her sister Caroline was
married to Horace Washburn, and they took her
to Europe with them in 1869, and while she was

away her husband assumed the responsibility of
writing to their sons.

It appears that Sam was still a bachelor at
the time the correspondence ends, but Ben
married Ella Spencer ("Kittie") Delano on

 
Chittenden Family

 

December 25, 1876. She was the daughter of
James S. and Mira Delano, and her father may
have been a brother of Columbus Delano, Sec-
retary of the Interior. The young couple

lived in the Delano home for a few years. Soon
after the marriage Ben became ill with what was

diagnosed as rheumatism. It was a very pain-
ful, serious, and lengthy illness. It appears
that he eventually recovered, and he and his
brother formed the Chittenden Brothers engi-
neering firm in Washington.

 
Chittenden Family 10

 

This collection contains a woman's point of
view on a variety of topics such as the moral
and spiritual welfare of her two sons, their
careers, their physical safety, especially
among the Indians of the West, and Connecticut
social and family life and politics.

In the latter part of the collection there
are many letters from Mrs. Mira Delano and
Kittie to Ben's mother. Since Mrs. Delano was
very articulate and of an affectionate nature,
she kept Mrs. Chittenden well informed about

 
Chittenden Family Ri

 

Ben's illness and the kinds of treatment he
was receiving. Kittie was also conscientious
about writing to her mother-in-law.

The family pictures include an ambrotype*
of Mrs. S. C. Chittenden, a photograph of
George B., and one that is perhaps of him, his

father, and his brother Sam. A clipping de-
scribes the wedding of Ben and Kittie, and
another one carries an engraving of the United
States Hayden Exploring Expedition that in-
cludes George B. Chittenden. An invitation to

newspapers and magazines. He became accuaint-
ed with Edgar A. Poe about 1840, and their re-
lations were alternately friendly and contro-

The ship Christopher, 189 tons, was operated
by Messrs. Thomas Leyland & Co. of Liverpool,
England, in the African trade. The Christopher,
originally an American vessel, had been seized
by the British and condemned as a prize at New

 

 

York in 1780 during the Revolutionary War. In
1786 she was raised and given new upper works.
There were further repairs in 1790. This in-

formation is from Lloyd's Register of Shipping

(1791) and from the port records of Dominica in
1790. Copies of pertinent pages from these
sources are filed with the volume.

Book 4th Voyage" records the complete, detailed
records (33 pp.) for this voyage from Liverpool
to the Congo River and thence to Barbados and
Dominica in the West Indies. The Christopher
sailed from Liverpool on June 19, 1791, and
arrived at Embomma (Boma) on the Congo River on

 

 
Christopher (Ship) 3

 

 

Sept. 14. On Oct. 22 she left Embomma with 274
slaves. The ship arrived at Barbados on Dec.
13, and afterwards her captain sold 270 slaves
at Dominica. She left the island on Jan. 11,
1792, and reached Liverpool on Feb. 12.

The records in this volume include: the in-

structions to Capt. Charles Molyneux; the de-
tailed invoice of the goods taken to Africa
including other expenses; a list of the crew
with names, occupations, and wages; accounts of
expenses for the cargo and for outfitting the

The forty-four documents that are bound toge-
ther in this volume are answers to a question-«
naire which was addressed to the priests of
parish churches and chapels in Hampshire, Eng-
land, in 1705. An ecclesiastical official, or
perhaps a clergyman who was working on church
history, was responsible for the questionnaire,
for two of the answers are addressed to an ec-
clesiastic (pp. 69, 71). There were ten ques-

 

 
Church of England. Diocese of Winchester. 2
fions which were designed to obtain specific
information about each church. Some priests an-
swered each question, while others responded to
only part of the list. The amount of detail in
the answers varies considerably. The questions
concerned the following subjects: Tithes; en-
dowment; augmentation or benefaction to the

 

vicarage; history of the founding of the church;
union or dismembering of the church; the parish
library; the yearly value of the vicarage; col-
lation, donation, or advowson (right of nomina-

 
Church of England. Diocese of Winchester. x 3
tion to a benefice) for the parish; whether or
not the vicarage was co-nominal; and whether the
church is noted in the Valor Beneficiorun.

The documents bear two sets of numbers, an
indication that they were once a part of a lar-
ger group of papers. One set of numbers runs
from 57 to 99 and serves as the pagination for
the volume. A number of the documents are sign-
ed by the parish priest who wrote then, and a
few of them also bear a date. Only part of the
parishes of Hampshire are represented.

The variety of handwriting and paper suggests
that the manuscripts are originals. Many of the
sheets bear watermarks with the initials "GR"
These initials stood for Gulielmus (William)
as well as for the Georges, so the watermarks
do not necessarily suggest copies written on
paper dating later than 1705. This use of "GR"
is noted in William Algernon Churchill, Water-
marks in Paper in Holland, England, France, etc.
in the XVII and XVIII Centuries and Their
Interconnection (Amsterdam, 1967), pp. 46-47.

been born in Pennsylvania, but after his marriag¢

 
Cibler, Sarah A. (Saylor) 2
he moved to Ohio where he spent the remainder
of his life as a cooper.

After Mrs. Saylor died some months following
her husband's death Jacob was taken by a neigh-
bor named Robert Haddow. The other children
were taken by different families in the commun-

 

ity, but their uncle, John Jones, would not per-
mit any of them to be adopted. Jacob's two
older brothers enlisted in 1861 in the 36th Regt
of O.V.M. Although he was only fifteen he en-
listed in that same regiment. He was retrieved

from the regiment by his uncle John Jones, but

 
Cibler, Sarah A. (Saylor) 3
later in 1861 he ran away from Mr. Haddow's and
enlisted in the 53rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry.

It appears from the correspondence that he did
much more hard fighting and marching than either
of his brothers, but Solomon was wounded twice
and probably taken prisoner twice. Eventually

 

Jacob was in Sherman's army. Early in 1863 he
was in north Mississippi. He writes of being
in Holly Springs, marching to College Hill and
camping, going on to the "Yockanicatopha" (later
Yocona) River, camping for twelve days, then to
near the Tallahatchie River; reports the large

 
Cibler, Sarah A. (Saylor) 4

 

rebel raid on Holly Springs and the destruction
of all of the U. S. Commissary stores there and
the capture of 2000 Union troops; then he writes
from La Grange, Tenn. His regiment is at Mos-
cow, Tenn., in April, 1863, where they are build
ing breastworks to defend the Memphis and
Charleston R. R. By the middle of June he is at

Haines Bluff near Vicksburg, and in the command
of Major General Sherman. He mentions that
Grant has been shelling Vicksburg for three or
four weeks and he calls him one of the greatest

generals in the U. S. Army. His unit moves on

 
Cibler, Sarah A. (Saylor) 5

 

to Jackson, Miss., as General Joseph E. Johnston
retreats. He mentions the reported strengths of
each army in that area, and that the rebels are
continually shelling them. They burn Jackson
and move on. He writes about the hardships of
marching and camp life, but his fighting spirit
continues to remain high and he does not com-

plain. His last two letters were written from
Scottsboro, Ala., and Dalton, Ga. He was ex-
pecting a hard but victorious fight for the
Union forces in the Dalton area. According to

his biography he continued in Sherman's army

 
Cibler, Sarah A. (Saylor) 6
from then until it reached Durham Station, N.C.,
where Johnston surrendered to Sherman. After
the war he headed west. He stopped in Missouri
for several years and then moved on to Kansas.
First he worked on constructing the Santa Fe

R. R. and then became a farmer and public office

 

holder. He died at the age of ninety.

It appears from Edward's letters that he may
have been the brother with the most formal edu-
cation. At least he wrote the best hand. From
all of the brothers' letters one gets descrip-
tions of camp life, military engagements,

 
Cibler, Sarah A. (Saylor) 2
reported losses in both armies during a number
of battles, hardships, and desires for furloughs
Jacob reveals occasionally several months ar-
rearage in his pay. In one letter from Camp
Dennison, Ohio, on March 13, 1864, he reveals
boredom because he is not down South fighting

 

the rebels. He says there is no one to fight
in that area but a few cowardly Copperheads who
are afraid to open their mouths.

All of Edward's and Solomon's service appears
to have been mainly in Virginia.and Tennessee.
On Apr. 26, 1863, Solomon was in General Crook's

 
Cibler, Sarah A. (Saylor) 8
Brigade near Carthage, Tenn. The next month
Solomon wrote that a rebel spy was to be hanged
that afternoon in the presence of all the troops
He also reports the mail of his unit being cap-
tured again along with about twenty of their
cavalrymen. In November 1863, Solomon was con-

 

valescing from a wound in General Hospital,
Nashville. He wrote that he had been taken as
a prisoner, held ten days during which he fared
very hard, and then was paroled along with some
other prisoners and sent through the lines. He

was then given a ~e but on Feb. 25, 1864,

 
Cibler, Sarah A. (Saylor) 9

 

he was writing from Camp Chase, Ohio. Edward
wrote on April 27, 1864, from Charleston, W.
Va., stating that troops were assembling there
daily and they would probably move soon in the
direction of Richmond. August 4, 1864, he re-
ported on the Battle of Winchester, Va., in

which he and Solomon had been engaged and of
Solomon receiving a flesh wound and probably
being taken prisoner. In January, 1865, Edward
was on duty at the USA General Hospital in Fred-
erick City, Md. Before that he had operated in
northern Maryland in search of rebels who were

 
Cibler, Sarah A. (Saylor) 10
returning from the raid into Pennsylvania and
the burning of Chambersburg.

While Jacob was in Moscow, Tenn., in the
spring of 1863 he wrote that a Negro regiment
was being formed that was to be called the first
Tennessee Colored Zouave Regiment. He said the

 

Negroes were volunteering fast. Jacob's script
and spelling show lack of formal education, but
his letters are the most interesting ones in the

collection.

Lewis Jacob Cist (1818-1885), a poet and
famous collector of autographs and old por-
traits, was born in Harmony, Pa. on Nov. 20,
1818, son of Charles and Janet (White) Cist.

 

His parents moved to Cincinnati, where he
became a bank employee. He was engaged in
banking in St. Louis from 1850 to 1870. After
that he entered government work and was sec-
retary of the zoological society in Cincinna-
ti. He published Trifles in Verse and Souvenir

 

 
Cist, Lewis Jacob 2
an annual, besides contributing to periodicals
of the day. He died at College Hill neer Cin-
Cinnati on Mar. 31, 1885.

The papers in this collection consist of
correspondence relating to autographs. The
letters were written to Cist by the following

 

eutograph collectors: Stephen. Alexander,
Henry C. Baird, Robert Clarke, Robert Gilmor
Oscar T. Keeley, James F. Meline, and Israel
K. Tefft.

Citizens National Bank. Papers, 1903-1942.
Durham, Durham County, North Carolina

The Citizens National Bank opened on May 1,
1905, and was the successor of the Morehead
Banking Company, Durham's oldest bank founded
in 1878. The Morehead bank changed ownership
several times but kept "Morehead" in its name.
Benjamin N. Duke was the first president of
Citizens National, and James B. Duke was a
director. The papers of B.N. Duke are in the
Manuscript Department. On October 31, 1959,
Citizens National merged with the Durham Bank

 

 
Citizens National Bank 2
and Trust Company, and the latter joined with
the University National Bank to become the
Central Carolina Bank and Trust Company, the
seventh largest bank in the state, on Oct. 2,
1961. Information about the bank appears in the
various editions of Moody's Bank and Finance
Manual.

The Morehead Banking Company is represented
only three volumes - a checks and devosits book,
a collection register, and a letterpress book
that he from the last two years of the firm,

Citizens National Bank 3
Bank are represented by a large, but incomplete,
collection of its general and subsidiary account
books and correspondence. These records are
extensive for the first fifteen years of the
bank, 1905-1920, and there are a variety of sub-
sidiary account books scattered through the
1920's and 1930's. These volumes are itemized
below following further introductory remarks.
Banking corporations maintain proprietorship
records that include accounts for the stock-
holders and minutes of their boards of directors.

 

 
Citizens National Bank 4
These records are not included in this collec-
tion.

The general, controlling account books of
banks early in this century were typically the
seneral ledger, the journal or cash book, the
daily statement book, and the balance book.
Citizens National used all these accounts ex-

 

cept the daily statement books.

The general ledger contained the concentrated
control accounts that recorded the daily totals
for each account of which the detailed trans-

 
Citizens National Bank 5
actions were kept in subsidiary ledgers. The
general ledgers are not in this collection but
are available for use at the bank.

The collection does include a substitute for
the general ledgers for 1907-1919. Citizens
National maintained Daily Balance Books that
constitute separate skeletonized ledgers.

National banks have been required by law to
report financial statements several times a year
and abstracts of the reports of the Citizens
National are printed in the annual reports of

 

 
Citizens National Bank 6
the Comptroller of the Currency. The National
Bank Act of 1864 also required the publication
of statements in the local press (Act, June 3,
1364, ch. 106, sec. 34, 13 Stat. 109), and this
practice is still required (U.S. Code, Title
12, Sec. 161). Some articles about the bank
appear in an index of local newspapers compiled

 

in a special catalog by the Newspaper Department.
The journal is a chronological record of

transactions and is the book from which they

are posted into the general ledger. The jour-

 
Citizens National Bank ?
nals: are complete from May 1, 1905 to June 25,
1919.

Tne subsidiary account books include: a banks
balance book, bills receivable registers,
check and deposit registers, collection regis-
ters, a first teller's cash account, individual
ledgers, liability ledgers, note teller's col-
lections, and one volume each for personal loans,
rediscounting, savings, and subscribers’ liberty
bonds and notes. A detailed listing of these
volumes is given below.

 

 
Citizens National Bank 8
The cashier's letterpress ;books begin with
the Morehead Bank in 1904 and continue into 1911

with partial runs for 1913 and 1915. A small
group of unbound correspondence dates from 1907-
1908 and 1918.

The following list includes a description of
each volume with its location number within the

 

collectioni The general books are listed first
followed by the subsidiary books (in alphabetical
order), and the correspondence.

Clare, William Keating Papers Ea
William Keating Clare (4026-1905) came
from Ireland to New York in 1847. His young-

er brother, Henry P. Clare, also came to
America and enlisted in the 9th New York
State Militia at the outbreak of the Civil
War. After that conflict he enlisted in the

regular army of the United States. He died

in 1892.

His letters to his brother, William,

are copied for the year 1863, when he begins
with a description of the Mud March og January

 
Clard, William Keat 2

of that year, Camp life is briefly described.
He writes of the march of his regiment north , |
to prevent General Lee from entering Alexandr
and he arrives at Emmitsburg with the tropps
which met the Confederates under General A.B.
Hill on the Cashtown Road in the first days
battle. His regiment withstands Pcikett's

 

Charge and follows the retreating Confederate
Army south to Virginia, where he ends the
year with leave. His comments of General
William Gordon Meade tend to be critical,

Two letters from C. M. Clark to his nephews
William and Tom are those of a solicitous uncle.
On the reverse of the letter to William is also
a letter by Clark's wife. Both Clark and his
wife express concern over not hearing from

William who is imprisoned on Johnson's Island

in Sandusky, Ohio. Clark tells him that he has
been told that Governor Zebulon B. Vance wishes
to get someone to go to Johnson's Island to take
clothing to the North Carolina troops there. He

 
Ciark,.Cz.Mé 2
asked him to let him know if he needed funds,
and if he did and someone took supplies to the
prison, he would try to get some gold and send
it to him. Apparently Tom was also in the Con-
federate Army since Clark ends his letter by

saying the "Servants express a wish to see you
and send love."

This diary was kept by a farmer, who made
one-line entries for each day during almost the
entire period between Jan. 1, 1847 and June 13,
1863. The entries record the weather and his
farming activities, church attendance, and some

other activities.

Clark lived in Hartford County, Connecticut.
The towns that he mentions are usually located
just northwest of Hartford.

Clark, Courtney J. Medical Notes and Diary,
1841-1874. Jacksonville, Calhoun Co., Ala.

 

Courtney J. Clark was a medical student at
Louisville, Ky. One of these vols. is his
notes while a student there. He was a native
of Selma, Ala., and later practiced in
Jacksonville, Ala. During the Civil War, he
was a surgeon in the Confederate Army, and
his medical diary notes many cases coming to
his attention while thus engaged. This
diary is thus of some interest and importance
for medical history.

 
Clark, Courtney J. Z

 

A biographical sketch of Clark is in Thomas
McAdory Owen's History of Alabama and Dictionary
of Alabama Biography (Chicago, 1921), Ill, 328.

Clark's full name was Courtney James Clark.
He died Sept. 16, 1893, and is buried at Old
Live Oaks Cemetery, Selma, Alabama.

This set, in spite of its size, is of
very little value. It is made up almost
completely of letters from family and friends
to Mrs. Cynthia A. Clark. Among them are
letters from her eldest son, Arthur Wilson
Clark, who was insane and frequently signed
himself "Napoleon Bonaparte." With the ex-

ception of a few

Scattered references to the

 
Clark, Cynthia A. W. Sketch (2)

 

Spanish-American War in the 1898 letters
(esp. see June 11, 1898), Arthur's letters
constitute the only distinguishing feature
of the collection, the other letters merely
retailing accounts of marriages, illnesses,
etc.

In the folder of newspaper clippings at the
end of the set may be found two clippings
on the John E. W. Keely "motor" hoax.

personal letters. One of Clark's sons attended

Washington and Lee Univ. in 1906, and a letter

from President George Denny describes the young

 

man's progress and incidentally throws some
light on the Weldon high school. Another son a

Francis Clark (d. 1895) was Highland
Attendant in Queen Victoria's personal house-
hold. His final illness and his death on
July 7, 1895, were mentioned in George Earl
Buckle, ed., The Letters of Queen Victoria,
Third Series (London, 1930- J, VOL. Ii.

A signed, personal letter from the Queen
on June 30, 1895, concerned Clark's illness,
and Dr. Tom Smith was probably the physician
who was mentioned.

Clark, Frederick W. Papers, 1861-1889. North-
ampton, Mass. 199 items, Sketch

The correspondence is between Clark and
his wife, mother, sister Julie, and Uncle Lucius
His mother and sister both lived on Elm St. in
Northampton. His first letter was written from
Medford, Mass., on July 22, 1861. He was then

 

in Co. C, 10th Regt. of Mass. Vols., and was of
the opinion that they would soon be going to

the theater of war, but did not think the Rebels
were likely to keep up the fight for long. On
Aug. 2 his company was in Washington. By Aug.

7 they had moved to a camp at Oak Grove, five

 
red W
miles northeast of Washington, where there were
four other regiments. Brig. Gen. Darius N.
Couch was in command, and this command was part
of McClellan's army.
While Clark is largely inactive in camp
he writes nearly every day, either to his wife

 

or mother. In his August letters he describes
life in camp - anxiety of soldiers to get mail,
card playing on Sunday, mending his clothes,
sickness and death in camp, guard duty, food,
foraging, pay of soldiers, a colohel prohibit-
ing gambling in his regt., desire of the men to

 
Clark, Frederick W,

fight, a religious service, strictness of Gen.
McClellan's discipline, and building of fortifi-
Cations. In his Aug. 7 letter he reported that
Gen. Joseph E. Johnston was expected to advance
on Washington by the route on which they were
stationed, which was the direct road to Balti-

 

more and Harper's Ferry. He and his fellow
soldiers were disappointed in the appearance
of Washington. On Aug. 21 he mentioned the
rumor that two nights earlier one-half of
Washington did not go to bed because they had
heard that the city was to be attacked.

 
Freder W.

His mother's letters start on Oct. 10.
his October letters he speaks approvingly of
the prayer meetings that have been instituted
in his regt., and tells of amusements; the
fighting spirit of his comrades; preparations
for a review by Pres. Lincoln and his failure
to appear; the capture of Leesburg by the
Federals, but with a severe loss; especially of
officers; his sight-seeing trip to Washington;
food, clothing, and bedding sent by his wife
and other relatives; Northampton boys in his
regt.; the alleged shooting of many Union

In

 
Clark, Frederick W.
officers by their troops who hated them for
their tyranny; and news of victories and defeats
of the Union Army elsewhere.

In a letter of Nov. 10 he reports that
John C. Fremont's successor, General David
Hunter, is reputed to be popular with both
officers and men, that they have just staged

 

a grand review for McClellan, the president,
and other distinguished persons, and that the
Enfield rifle is a fine weapon. On Nov. 21 he
described a Thanksgiving dinner in Camp.

His mother, in her December letters, speaks

 
Clark, Frederick W. 6
of patriotic activities of the ladies to help
the sick and wounded; the prediction by an agent
of the American and Foreign Christian Union

that the Roman Catholic religion would be
speedily overthrown in Europe as the people
began to enjoy liberty; and when she replies to

 

his report in a letter of Dec. 15 of a duel
between two privates in the 36th N. Y. Regt.
which took the life of one and woundéd the other,
she expressed astonishment that such a relic

of barbarism was to be found other than among
the "fiery & hot-headed Southrons, "

 
rk, Frederick W, 7
Obviously Clark's wife was not as well
educated as her husband and mother-in-law.
In her December letters she mentioned buying
a picture of Gen. McClellan, the impatience
among Civilians over the continued inactivity
of McClellan, her lack of anxiety for emanci-

 

pation since she felt that would work itself
out as fast as the Rebels were beaten, a favor-
able report on Gen. Halleck, rumors of the
dreadful plight of Unionists in some parts of
Missouri, her expectations that Horace Greeley
and "his 014 white hat" might show up at Camp

 
Clark, Frederick W, 8
with Henry Ward Beecher, and of women sewing
for the troops.

In December, 1861, he speaks of their
building barracks to replace tents, his belief
(which he mentions more than once) that south-
ern soldiers cannot stand cold as well as nor-

 

thern troops, a reconnaissance balloon landing
in their camp, his contempt of Capt. J. B.
Parsons, who is from his home town, and is a
friend of his family, the favorable impression
General Buell has made on him and others, a
Union soldier being shot for trying to desert

 
Clark, Frederick W, 9
to the Rebels, the impatience manifested over
McClellan's failure to move (he feels McClellan
should be allowed to make his own decisions),
the report that General Scott is to be in Wash-
ington to advise the Cabinet, attitude of him-
self and his fellow soldiers toward the possi-

 

bility of Great Britain joining the South, and
drinking and gambling of his fellow soldiers.
On Jan. 5, 1862, Clark's uncle Lucius
wrote to him about the operation of the family
paper mill. On Jan. 11 Clark's mother wrote
of conflicting rumors about the economic con-

 
Clark, Frederick W. 10

dition of southerners, illness of a northern
Chaplain in a prison in Charleston, S. C., who
was taken prisoner at Bull Run, rumor that the
South regrets that the North surrendered Mason
and Slidell for this will ease somewhat the
tension between Great Britain and the North,

 

production at the paper mill, that Col. Jenni-
son is giving the West a hard time, and her
belief that the Civil War is divine punishment
for the toleration of slavery and the pride and
worship of prosperity in both the North and

South,

 
Clark, Frederick W. mes
In Jan., 1862, Clark is still at Camp

Brightwood, near Washington. He opposes England
entering the war because he°thinks that would
greatly lengthen the ordeal. He thinks the
more ignorant of the people in the vicinity of
his camp are the most ignorant ones he has ever
seen. On Jan. 9 he speaks of McClellan's re-

 

stored health, his disgust at the drinking and
swearing of some of the soldiers in camp; on
Jan, 26 he relates an example of Capt. Parsons'
meanness; and on Jan. 29 he praises Stanton
and says Gen. Burnside has full possession of

 
Clark, Frederick W, a 12
the two principal sounds of N. C.

In Feb., Clark praises Burnside over and
over (obviously he is his hero); says the South
has about reached the conclusion that its cause
is hopeless; says Lincoln is a first rate man
but he does not think much of s wife; mentions
the actions of Gen.. Grant and,Foote on the

 

Tennessee River; praises McClellan but calls
Gen. Charles Pomeroy Stone a traitor (Stone was
arrested on Feb. 9, 1862, on the charge that he
was responsible for the disaster at Ball's
Bluff the previous October); mentions the

 
Clark, Frederick W, Sa
victories at Forts Henry and Donelson on the
Tennessee; and repeats his conviction that the
Confederates will soon give up. Sometimes he
describes their celebration in camp upon learn-
ing of Union victories,

During the first part of March, 1862, his

 

company marched from Camp Brightwood to Prospect
Hill, Va., and back. He describes the Army of
the Potomac on the march. On Mar. 19 he says
the men have lost much of their confidence in
McClellan and that if something is not done

soon Gen. Fremont will step into his shoes, and

 
Clark, Frederick W, 14

he speaks of the Merrimac and the Monitor - the
latter he thinks will take care of the former.

Occasionally he mentions accidents in camp. In
his Mar. 19 letter he also states that they are
45,000 strong and are almost ready to start on

an expedition. Many of the soldiers made up

 

stories to keep up the excitement. On Mar. 31
the Army of the Potomac, which he stated number-
ed over 100,000, was within two miles of Newport
News, Va. They were within sight of drilling
Rebels, and he thought a battle would soon
start. He continues to speak of hardships. By

 
Frederick W. 15
this time his son has been born.

On Apr. 6 they were at Warwick Court House,
on their way to Fortress Monroe, twenty-five
Miles away. He describes the movement of the
Masses of the troops constituting McClellan's
army, foraging, and the terrible roads, which

 

they were improving. On Apr. 13 he criticized
the sutlers for their high prices and mentions
corduroy roads and slim rations for both men
and livestock as a result of muddy roads, and
McClellan visiting them and predicting they
would have to fight in that vicinity the hardes

 
Clark, Frederick W. - 18
battle they had fought. On Apr. 21 they were
being held in reserve six miles from Yorktown.
On May 22 they were only twelve miles from
Richmond, and on the 30th they were within five
miles of the place. He was confident they would
Capture Richmond within a few days. He has a

 

good bit to say relative to transportation and
supplies, and speaks of the response to Lincoln's
Call for volunteers. Between then and June 2
he engaged in his first battle but came through
unharmed - briefly describes the battle, giving
the Union casualties. In a letter of June 8,

 
Clark, Frederick W. 17
when he was behind the rifle pits near Richmond,
he speaks of sutlers charging high prices,
praises Halleck and Banks, and says they have
great confidence in McClellan and that he tells
them the next battle will be the decisive one
of the war. On June 9 he writes from near Fair

 

Oaks Station and again mentions high prices
charged by sutlers, and how some of the men, not
he, spend so much of their pay with the sutlers
(in an earlier letter he remarked that the men
would have tobacco if they could get it). On
June 11 he writes from the same station. He

 
Clark, Frederick W, 18_
speaks of living conditions - they now have
French canvas tents that will sleep as many as
20 men. In the letters of this period he gives
vivid descriptions of hardships of camp life.
On June 14, at the same station, he says they
know little about the over-all battles and that
the men have unbounded confidence in their

 

generals. His next letter was written on Dec.
17, 1862, but he does not give the place.

The remainder of the correspondence conce
personal and business matters. By the last part
of 1877 his mother was in San Francisco and her

 
Clark, Frederick W, =

letters of the following year to Fred reveal
that he had come under some sort of cloud and
lost his job. In all of her letters she ad-
vises him as to how he should conduct himself
and try to get another job. She contradicts
his statement that he should come to Cal by

 

describing the unemployment and poverty there.
She also speaks of the Chinese Sabbath school
she is teaching and says that she supposes she
will not go to hear the speeches Henry Ward
Beecher is to make there. She also mentions
commodity prices and the "terrible misery and

 
Clark, Frederick W, 20

sorrow in the Southern states and how the huma
ty comes out all over the country in response
to the appeal for funds and means." Fred then
had two sons. His sister, with whom his mother
lives in San Francisco, writes an interesting
letter on Sept. 22, 1878, summarizing her ob-

 

servations on Cal. during the four years she
has been living there. By Mar. 16, 1879 Fred
had regular employment, and his mother writes
then also of the hostility toward the Chinese
in Cal. She was a member of the First Congre-
gational Church. There are no letters from his

 
Clark, Frederick W,

21
mother between Apr. 37, 1879 and June 27, 1689.
The letter of the latter date is the last item

in the collection, and she was then living in

Department dealing with a related branch of

 

the Clark family: Samuel B. Clark Papers,
Brothersville, Ga.

Henry Clark has several business items
dealing with Harris & Jones, Richmond, Va.,
tobacco factors. E.g., an account of Nov. 26,

1819, first lists ~~ (including Samuel

 
Clark, Henry
Mordecai, perhaps the father of Samuel Fox

Mordecai} who received hogsheads of Clark's
tobacco, and then payments made by the firm
to different people (mostly to pay off Clark's
debts).

Several business items mention Galt &

 

Bulloch, a Richmond, Va., merchandising firm
(e.g., Dec. 25, 1819).

A legal paper of ca. 1820 mentions Samuel
Garland and Creed Taylor.

"Ro Gamble," who perhaps was Robert Gamble
and an ancestor of “oe Cabell, is list-

 
Clark, Henry _4
ed on “two tobacco accounts of 1821 and one of
1822. An item of 1821 mentions a William M.
Rives.

Henry Clark signs notes on Oct. 29, 1821
and Nov. 22, 1822 to pay Richard Pollard (per-
haps the father of Edward Alfred Pollard).

 

An indenture of Feb. 11, 1822 mentions

Joseph Echols (perhaps the father of John
Echols).

A business letter of Aug. 26 ¢7), 1822
mentions a Dr. Cabell.

On June 26, 1823 Henry Clark signs a note

 
Clark, Henry §
to pay a General Leftwich c¢sp.?3.

Clark is billed $3.00 on July 28, 1824 for
a Negro child's coffin.

On Feb. 16, 1833 John Early (probably the
same who later became a Methodist bishop)
acknowledges receipt of H. Clark's $96.00 for

 

=o ae

two Negro slaves.

A member of the Va. State House of Dele-
gates, Rice W. Wood, in a letter of Dec. 23,
1831 from Richmond, Va., mentions a T. cor F 7;
W. Gilmer, who is perhaps Thomas Walker Gilmer.
Wood discusses a House Committee, of which he

 
Clark, Henry 6
Wood) is a member, "to enquire into the state
of the coloured people of this Commonwealth."
(Note: This was not long after the Nat Turner
insurrection.) He speaks of the "great anxiety"
and "painful interest" shown in the subject by
the Committee. "It is the all consuming sub-

 

ject...I do not think that any law can pass c7 3
touching -?3 the slaves directly. But initia-
tory steps will be taken to provide a place in
which they can be sent. And they will make
experiment upon the free negroes. It is cer-
tainly not wise to “~~ the state definitively

 
Clark, Henry 7
upon the subject of manumission until our way
Can be more clearly seen...I am willing to hear
the matter debated." He speaks of experiments
in transporting Negro slaves and free Negroes
(to Africa 7). "To liberate them Negro slaves;
and permit them to reside among us, is a thing

 

not to be thought of for a moment." "I approve
fully of your suggestion of preventing all
persons from trading with slaves without the
written permission of the owner... ."

A letter of 1834 mentions a board of
trustees, presumably of_an educational insti-

 
Clark, Henry 8
tution,

An inventory of 1834 lists the personal
property of Henry Clark, deceased.

A letter of May 16, 1845 mentions salt,
iron, and tobacco.

There are many checks in this collection,

 

mostly signed by Henry Clark, including those
made in favor of Thomas Faulkner, John Vest,
James W. Dibrell, William Jones, R. Pollard,
John Ransom, John 0. Leftwich, Augustus Left-
wich, John Tayloe, H. Langhorn -7?;, M. Clay,

18M8.%5 Tarboro, North Carolina Sketch

 

Hanry Toole Clark (1808-1874) was the son
of James West Clark and Arabella (Toole) Clark.
His grandfather was probably Christopher Clark,

a ship's captain. As early as 1801 James West
Clark was located in Bertie County and about 1810
took up residence 1n Tarboro: He was a planter
who during the next ten years invested extensivel
in slaves, and purchased at least two large tract
of land, One in Dyer County, Tennessee, and the

Other gy Sumter County, Alabama. (Over)

 
CLARK, Henry Toole Sketch —~2--
Henry Toole Clark was educated at the

University of North Carolina, graduating in 1826,
received legal training but did not practice, and
about 1830 took over his father's plantation and
business affairs. About 1835 some of the slaves
were sent to Alabama where they were hired out.
The several records of slave hire form one of

 

the most valuable segments of the collection. £
James Hair acted as Clark's agent in Alabama,
while in Tennessee Daniel E. Parker was delegated
to sell the lands.

In 1850 Henry Toole Clark was elected stat
Senator, and office "é he filled until 1861.

 
CLARK, Henry Toole Sketch --3-—

in 1859 he was chosen president of the senate by
virtue of which he succeeded to the governorship
upon the death of John Willis Ellis in July,1861.
At this crictical juncture Clark managed the afi
ts of state with credit to himself, and retired
from office in September, 1862. He was again ele-
cted to state senate in 1866,

 

The collection is chiefly made up of bills
receipts, accounts, indentures, and other matters
of business and legal nature. There are 176 lett~
ers, many of them referring to Clark's business

and investments in Tennessee and Alabama. The
letters from 1860 to ‘oO are chiefly of a

 
CLARK, Henry Toole, Sketch, (4)
political and military nature - many of them re
Guests of military appointments. The letters o
1862 comment chiefly on North Carolina's part i
the conduct of the war, Those after the war are
concerned with Clark's pardon and with certain
legal aspects of reconstruction,

The collection yields almost no personal and
family information. In 1850 Clark married Mrs.
Mary W.(Parker) Hargrave. There were three dau-
ghters and two sons. The names of three of the
children were Maria T., Laura P., and Haywood,
The latter was a student at Cape Fear Academy in
1880 and in 1878 was or" for a railroad,

Randolph, Secretary of War of the C, S. A.,
discussing the weakening of the C. S, A, Army

as a result of desertion and absences without

The Miscellany includes a manuscript of ca.

1851 that is apparently an index (9 pp.) to the
probate of wills and to the administration of

 
Clark, Henry Toole 7
estates in Edgecombe County during 1760-1851.
The index has alphabetical sections from let-
ters C (incomplete) to W. Within each section
of the alphabet the names are arranged chrono-
logically. This index has special interest, be
cause it includes names not found in Abstracts

 

of the Wills of Edgecombe County North Carolina
1733-1856. These names not found presumably
refer to estates for which there were no wills.
The dates in this manuscript index do not always
coincide with the date of death, for the probate

 

 
Clark, Henry Toole
court proceedings were sometimes in later years,
The index dates from about 1851, the date of
the latest notation. The blue stationery is
common to the 1850's and thereabouts.

The Oversize Folder contains a manuscript
sheet entitled "Pitt County, A List of the Nun-

 

ber of Souls in Captn. Cannon's District." It
includes a column for personal names, followed
by columns for the numbers of males of age,

males underage, females of age, females under-
age, black males of age, black males underage,

 
Clark, Henry Toole 9

 

black females of age, black females underage,
and totals. The information in these columns
does not correlate with that prescribed for
the state census taken in 1784-1787 or for the
census requested by the state Congress in 1775
(Colonial Records, X, 255). However, the N.C.
State Archives has a list, dated 1775, from

 

Pitt County that has the same column headings.
Since the N.C. Congress, acting upon a request
from the Continental Congress, ordered a census
in 1775, this manuscript is part of that

 
Clark, Henry Toole 10

 

census. Tax lists of the period are similar in
appearance and content, but the tax laws did
not provide for enumerating white women. The
listing of white women distinguishes this manu-
script from the tax lists. This manuscript has
been published: Jean Anderson, "The Census of
1775 as Seen in Pitt County, N. C."™ The North

Carolina Genealogical Society Journal,” ”

These papers bdong to the Christopher
Clark, Sr.. family of Albemarle County, Va.,
and deal with business and family affairs
as the Clarks migrated and married in Camp-

 

bell 6o., near Lynchburg, Va.; in Wilkes Co.,
Ga., 1782-1801; and in Richmond Co., Ga.,
1850-1880. Presumably they were related to

the George Rogers Clark family, who lived two
miles from Charlottesville, Albemarle Co., till
1752, when they 6 Caroline Cotinty,

 
Clark, Samuel B, 2

Capt. Christopher Clark, Sr., ari his wife
Penelope, of Albemarle Go., were among the
early seltlers (ca. 1722) along the eastern
ge lopes of the Blue Ridge. They became Quakers
} about 1748, and their sons Edward, Bowling,

 

\ Christopher, Jr., Micajah, William, James od thor

Sarah (Clark) Lynch, and Elizabeth (Clark}

anthony were county officials and prominent
citizens of Albemarle, Louisa, and Campbell
Counties. They migrated to Ga. and to Clark

Co., Kty.

 
Clark, Samuel B. 3

 

Christopher Clark, Sr., was presumably
the brother of Jonathan and John Clark of King
and Queen Co., Va., from whom George Rogers
Clark and the Jefferson Co., Kty., families
are descended. Numerous descendants of Chris-
topher, Jonathan and John Clark are scattered

over the Midwest.

The signatures of pioneers John Henderson,
Nicolas Merlwether, and John Nicholas: of
Albemarle appear on early tax slips.

Early papers belong to Bowling Clark, the

 
Clark, Samuel B, 4

 

Shefiff of Albemarle Co., 1764-1773, who was
also in the Quartermaster's Department at
Albemarle Barracks, Vs., curing the Revolution-
ary War. Letters dealing with the closing of
this department come from Bowlings brother,
Capt. James Clark, and Col. John Harvie. Many

of the early letters center around Capt. James
Clark. The use of wagons, horses, and gear
in war transport, indigo as a trade commodity
in Va., and the return to Richmond by Harvie
and miscellaneous Clarks as the war closes are

 
Clark, Samuel B. 5

 

noted. Of interest are Harviés comments on the
market in wheat, hemp, and flour, and his
instructions for purchase of soldiers! discharg
military certificates, and "rights", at the
end of the war.

On Sept. 23, 1782, Jogph Anthony, who

married Elizabeth Clark, writes to Jas. Clark
of Albemarle referring to brothers Bowling,
Micajah, and Wm. Clark .in a letter concerning
migration to Georgia. Lottery tickets for
sale by sheriffs, land surveys, and slave sales

 
Clark, Samuel B, 8

 

and purchases appear in 1784. Wm. Clark and
Co. is in business in Augusta, Ga. By 1791
he is back in Albemarle. Jas. Clark by that
tite has moved to Campbell Co:, Va., together
with brother Bowling. Other Clarks mentioned i
these years are Christopher, John, Thomes M.

and Bowling. About 1794 Wm. Anderson of Camp—
bell Co. enters the papers. The second family
group is that of this family who married into
the Clark clan. Wm. Clark of Albemarke and
James of Campbell are involved in local politis

 
» Clark, Samuel B, 7

in the 1790's. The Anthony family has a series
of letters from Ga. describing gardens and
/plantation life. Bowling Clark is involved
| in land surveys in Bourbon County, Kty.
Micajah and James Clark were copartners in a
distillery at this time. Micajah, on Feb. 10,

 

1800, describes the race horse, Young Abdella,
and its pedigree through the famous Ga. horse
Eclipse, owned by Wm. Gibbons.

Jas. Clark from his home "Pleasant Mount"
refers to his nephew Micajah Clark, who has

 
Clark, Samuel B, 8

 

gone to Ga. with the Anthony family. He gives
a description of the Washington Monument about
to be erected by Congrees in June, 1800. He
comments on the Alien and Sedition laws, the
Standing Army of the U.S., and the choosing

of Presidential electors. Jospph Anthony in

1800-1801 writes of the opening of Ga.'s
western land, gives an excellent description
of a barbecue at that time by his "Hunting
Club", and commets on cotton prices and planting
James Clark comments on Thomas Jefferson, John

 
Clark, Samuel B, 2g
Adams, and relations with France,

The Anderson letters begin in 1814 with
soldiers' letters to the Anderson sisters of
Prince Edward Co., Va., describing the
American blockade of the British in Alexandria,
and camp life at Camp Mitchell near Richmond,
Ve. This family, devout Methodists, comment on
preaching, revivals, and wickedness. The Watts
and Lee families are those of Fanny Anderson
and Kitty Anderson. Joseph C. Lee describes
Charleston and Mason County, Va., in 1825.
Land deéds from Richmond, Va., 1825, and a

 

 
Clark, Samuel B, 10
Revolutionary War pension claim of John Willard
of Campbell Co., Va., are included. The Va.
letters in the 1830's are by the descendants of
Jas. and Bowling Clark, Ghiefly the Winston

and Massie families. In 1846 a complicated
disposition by will is made of the skves of
Bowling Clark of Campbell Co.

 

Papers of the Ga. Glarks begin in 1840
from Richmond Factory, Richmond Co., and incluié
letters from JohnW., Samuel B., and Charles E.
Clark, brothers, which cover land deeds, social
life, and school letters. John W. Clark , in

 
amuel B, es oe
school at Covington, Newton County, Ga., 1840-
42, writes many letters to Dr. Samuel B. Clark.
Dr. Alexander Means, President of Emory and
noted Ghemist, writes to Dr. Samuel Clerk in
1852 about a ’ spesking engagement. The family
letters and papers of Dr. Samuel B. Clark of
Brothersville, Ga., conclude the manuscripts.
Comments are made on the Mathhias Clark family
of Burke Co., Ga. Sons Wdter A. and Wm. H.
Clark and their mother, Martha R. (Walker)
Clark write concerning Emory College, Oxford,

.? , to her sons in the Confederate Army,
making adverse comment on "Jackson", presum-
ably "Stonewall".

Confederate soldiers'hetters from the Va.
branch of Clarks center in two good letters
from James Rucker of Lynchburg to his mother

 

in 1861 from Camp Talbot near Norfolk. Aside
from camp life and the need for uniforms being
made at Lynchburg, Artillerist Rucker explains
the construction of the ironclad Merrimac at
the Norfolk navy yard in order to surprise the

ordained in 1833 (See Kenneth Walter Cameron's

American Episcopal Clergy).
The letter of 18 s from Demopolis where

Ives served a church. He also had churches at
Greensboro and on the prairie between the two
towns. His comments are full of his initial

impressions of social and economic conditions,

 

 

cotton culture, the plantation system, agri-
culture, slang expressions, immigration, and his
churches,

The two letters of 1835 and 1836 are from

Mobile where Ives was teaching school, first
at his own establishment and later at the Mobile
Institute. He wrote about the schools, economic
conditions, the church, Mobile, and his brother
David's seizing the advantages of immigration

Methodist chapel in Liverpool. He expresses
his disapproval of “eo of an organ in

 
Clarke, Adam 6

 

a Methodist chapel and states that he generally
refuses to speak in chapels with organs. His
reason for not speaking at Liverpool, however,
was the inconvenience of the date appointed for
the services. Otherwise, he would have relaxed
his principles and spoken at Liverpool, a place
that he claims includes many Methodists who
were converted by his ministry and for whom he
feels a great responsibility.

Alfred Alexander Clarke was the author and
illustrator of fonoarap on the Cathedral

 

Church of Wells ... (A. G. Young, Wells,
1896). An exhibition of his works at the
Royal West of England Academy was noted in the

(Feb. 10, 1926), p. 23.

This collection consists of fifty-one draw-
ings and ten engravings of buildings and scenes,

Alice (Judah) Clarke was the great-grand-
daughter of Joseph McCorkle.

Alice wrote this volume, entitled "Sketch of
the History of Joseph McCorkle" (cover title) or
"A Pioneer: Joseph McCorkle, Our Great Grand

Father" (title page title) in 1895. Joseph was
the son of Alexander and Margaret McCorkle, who
had emigrated to the American colonies from
Scotland ca. 1729, settling in Pennsylvania and
then in North Carolina.

 
Clarke, Alice (Judah) 2
Joseph, one of their seven sons, was born
near Lancaster in 1754. Serving against the
British in the Revolutionary War, he was cap-
tured but managed to escape. With his wife,
Margaret, he lived in Tennessee (1787-1800),
Lexington, Kentucky (1800-?), and Piqua, Ohio.
He was a successful farmer, slaveowner turned

 

abolitionist, and was considered a philosopher
and a Christian by his family. The account
covers the history of the family in America and
lists her sources of information.

Joseph was the brother of Samuel E, McCorkle,

Miss Annie Grace Clarke died at an advanced
age and was buried at Ephesus Baptist Church,
Dunnsville, Essex County, Virginia. She was an
only child.

The collection consists of an album (24 pp.)

that she compiled and numerous items found
within it that were not attached to the pages.
The album, entitled "Scraps," is a period piece
of social history from the 1880s and 1890s. At

 
Clarke, Annie Grace 2
that time it was fashionable for young women to
compile highly decorative albums of cards and
scraps, also called scrap pictures (now called
stickers). This was also a period when chromo-
lithography was a fine art, and many of thecards
and stickers are beautiful examples of colored
printing and embossing. Miss Clarke's album
contains numerous scraps, album cards, trade
cards, and token of affection cards. There are
also some greeting cards.

This album was probably begun in 1889, for

 

 
Clarke, Annie Grace 3

 

there is a date scrap for that year on the firs
page. A small number of the items in the album
have printed copyright dates, all of them
during 1880-1889. A baseball scrap for William
Gleason of the St. Louis team probably dates
during 1892-1894 when he was a member of that
club. The compilation of the album probably
extended from 1889 into the 1890s.

The album was designed to contain scraps as
its printed title "Scraps" indicates. One of
the token of affection cards has the words

 
Clarke, Annie Grace

 

"scrap pictures" printed on it underneath the
scrap that is affixed to it. The scraps inthis
album are very numerous, varied, and of high
quality.

Token of affection cards were of name card
size and usually expressed a loving sentiment
with dainty border or sketch. They were used
as visiting cards or exchanged on suitable oc-
casions. Miss Clarke put many token of af-
fection cards in her album, and there are 18
loose ones. These cards usually have scraps

 
Clarke, Annie Grace

 

affixed to them and were apparently made for
that purpose. Many of the scraps are loose on
one end and, when raised, reveal the name of
the giver underneath, usually printed on the
card.

Album cards were printed on one side only
containing views, portraits, birds, animals,
flowers, or similar items or general interest.
They do not bear the names of publishers or
advertisers. Miss Clarke included numerous al-
bum cards in her book. The history of album

 
Clarke, Annie Grace

 

cards and token of a affection cards is noted in
J. R. Burdicks's The American Card Catalog.

Advertising trade cards of the period were
often finely printed and decorative, and Miss
Clarke put many in her album representing
numerous businesses. A list of these businesses
is filed in the Information Folder.

 

Greeting cards include those for a birthday,
Christmas, Easter, and New Year's. Christmas
and New Year's cards include some with spring or
summer scenes, a fashion of the times. One

 
Clarke, Annie Grace
Christmas card is fringed. An Easter card is
in the shape of an envelope.

The two baseball player scraps are for players
on the St. Louis team: William Gleason, short
stop, and Curtis Welch, center field. Gleason
played for St. Louis during 1892-1894, and Welch
during 1885-1887.

The loose scraps and cards found with the
album have been placed in folders that are filed
with the volume.

George Clarke was apparently a resident of
Wyandotte, Michigan, where his correspondent
H. J. Alvord wrote to him. Alvord was a
clerk in the Indian Office in Washington,
D.C., according to his listing in Boyd's
Washington and Georgetown Directory (1864).

 

Alvord was a delegate from Wayne County to
the state constitutional convention in 1850
(Silas Farmer, The History of Detroit and
Michigan...(Detroit, 1884).

 

 
Clarke, George

 

On Oct. 16, 1863, Alvord expressed satis-—
faction at the outcome of the elections and
criticized George Brinton McClellan.

On March 21, 1864, Alvord discussed the
gubernatorial and congressional elections in
Michigan and candidates Judge Edwards of
Tuscola Co., William A. Horward, Jacob M.
Howard, and Fernando C. Beaman. Alvord
supported Lincoln also.

These twelve letters show Clarke as probably

a large and prosperous farmer in the upper Shen-

andoah Valley. He sent his produce to Richmond

where the firm of Hill and Norfleet were his fac
tors. He sold wheat, flour, tobacco, butter,and
lard. The letters in 1861 reflect the already

 

rising prices and also mention the scarcity of
salé.

The first item in this collection is a cer-
tificate by J. G. Palfrey, Dean of the Harvard

 

U. Divinity School, stating that. Clarke has
finished the prescribed theological course in
that institution.

In 1841 Clarke founded The Church of the
Disciples, a Unitarian Church, in Boston. Sub-

 
Clarke, James Freeman. 2
scribers in support of his ministry included his
brother-in-law, Frederic Huidekoper; and George
Bemis, Samuel E, Brackett, (1836-1911), Walter
Channing, John Farrar, Nathaniel Green, Jr.
(1797-1877), David Reed, and possibly William
Page (1811-1885). The Bible Class of 1842-

 

1843 includes John Albion Andrew. S. E. Brackett
writes on Jan. 1, 1844 about church finances.
On Apr. 19, 1853 H. D. Rogers and others write
to Clarke to return to his pastorate.

Clarke's MSS. on the prophet Joel mentions

 
Clarke, James Freeman. 3
Prof. Frederic Dan Huntington. A letter of

May 16, 1871, to Clarke disdusses his accepting
office in the American Unitarian Assn. A letter
of Oct. 11, 1870, together with an enclosed item
discusses the possible transfer of the Meadville
(Pa.) Theological School to Chicago. The Rev.

 

Charles Gordon Ames, later to succeed Clarke as
Pastor of the Church of the Disciples, is men-
tioned on Aug. 17, 1871.

A letter of Sept. 19, 1874, discusses a
Congress of Orientalists in London, including

 
Clarke, James Freeman. 4
K. R. Lepsius, Max Mueller, and E. T. Owen.

Mrs. Zina Fay Peirce writes to Clarke on
Apr. 27 and May 2, 1876, about a Statesmen's
Conference. In her first letter she mentions
E. L. Godkin, J. E. Johnston, J. RB. Lowell,

H. W. Paine, and Emory Washborn; and asks Clarke

 

to screen the names on an attached list (not
included in this collection). He endorses
(among others): George Bancroft, B. H. Bristow,
W. C. Bryant, Peter Cooper (1791-1883), G. W.
Curtis, H. W. Paine, S. J. Tilden, and Emory

 
Clarke, James Freeman. 5
Washburn; and suggests (with another) Marshall
Jewell and James Speed. Mrs. Peirce in her
second letter discusses the Republican and Demos
cratic parties, the coming presidential electio
Marshall Jewell, and H. C. Lodge I (1850-1924).
Clarke writes on Nov. 29, 1879, to Gen.

 

Charles Devens, requesting that his nephew,
Gen. H. S. Huidekoper, be appointed U. S. Mar-
shall for Eastern Pa. The Gen. had lost his
right arm while commanding a Pa. regt. on the
first day of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1,

1863).
S

 
Clarke, James Freeman. 6
President Abraham Lincoln had written a note to
the War Dept asking it to give Col. Huidekoper
anything he wanted.

Secretary of War. E. M. Stanton, Clarke
relates, offered Nuidekoper anything he wanted,
including his office. Huidekoper asked to be

 

given only a recruiting office for his regt. He
served as a General in the Pa. National Guard
for 15 years after the Civil War and commanded
the 7th Div. during the railroad riots of 1877.
(See Who Was Who in America, I, 604.) Clarke

 

 
Clarke, James Freeman. Z

 

praises his nephew's performance in command of
the western div. of Pa. during the Railroad
Strike of 1877, particularly his very effectual
assistance to Gen. J. F. Hartranft. The Rev.,
it appears, reasons that a commendable job of
strikebreaking in the Western part of a State

qualifies oréfor a marshalcy in the Eastern
part. Devens' reply is not given in this coll-
ection, but Who Was Who shows that Huidekoper
became Postmaster of Philadelphia in 1880 when
Hayes was still in the White House. (A letter

 

 
Clarke, James Freeman. 8
from Clarke to Hayes, dated Nov. 29, 1879, and
dealing with the same subject, was transferred
from this collection to the R. B. Hayes MSS.,
also in this Dept., on 11-2-59.)

Some of the best letters in this collection
are addressed to Anna (Huidékoper) Clark by a

 

British writer who signed herself "Edith J.
Lawrence." She is Lady Edith Jane (Smith)
Durning-Lawrence (1844- ), wife of Sir Edwin
Durning-Lawrence (1837-1914), First Baronet,
Liberal M. P. and Baconian theorist; and sister-
in-law of Sir James Lawrence (1820-

 
Clarke, James Freeman. 9
-1897), First Baronet. She writes from 1886 to
1896 mostly about religion and politics in Great
Britain.

Lady Durning-Lawrence praises Clarke, his
books, his tracts, and his sermons. Sir Edwin
has placed his books in the principal English

 

libraries. Some of Clarke's tracts have been
circulated. The Lady regrets that Unitarianism'g
progress has been so slight in the British Isles,
despite the good work of the church's Post Offiag
Mission and the enthusiasm of the Kev. Robert

 
Clarke, James Freeman. 10
Spears in Londone In Dec., 1896 she dislikes
the Church Advisory Committee's Recommendation
of an avowed non-Christian for the ministry. a
This sort of thing, the Lady laments, renders
the lot of British Unitarians even more deptor-
able, for even as it is, prejudice against them

 

makes it difficult for them to secure positions
as governess and school teachers.

Lady Durning-Lawrence takes a lively interes
in British political personalties and activities,
discussing Lord Balfour, W. E. Gladstone, C.S.

 
Clarke, James Freeman. ll
Parnell, Queen Victoria, British-Irish relations,
and the Liberal and Conservative parties. She
also mentions Robert Browning.

In the summer of 1905 Miss Lilian Freeman
Clarke, daughter of J. F. Clarke, writes several
letters mainly about a Unitarian Conference on

 

the Isles of Shoals off the coast from Ports-
mouth N. H.

There is an undated pamphlet by Clarke
on Church-Going., He also reviews Nelly Brooke
by Mrs. Florence (Marryat) Church Lean (also

known as Mrs. Francis Lean and Mrs. Ross Church);
Wrecked in Port by Edmynd Hodgson Yates; and

William Clarke was a planter in Claiborne
County according to the federal population -
census of 1860. Lewis Clarke, aged 19 in
1860, was his son. Two other children were
Josephine and Walter R. Clarke. By about

1870 the Clarkes had a plantation store, but
they were apparently not general merchants in
the usual sense. They lived at or near
Rocky Springs.

Some of the merchants with whom the Clarkes

 
Clarke, Lewis 2
had business dealings were: Bogart, Foley

& Avery; Pearson & Hume; and Johnson &
McGilvary. Also referred to frequently are
S. Bernheimer & Sons of Port Gibson, Miss.,
and J. W. Champlin & Co. of New Orleans. The
biggest volume of trade as indicated by these
papers was in cotton, corn, pork, and flour,

 

but sugar, coffee, cotton cards, bagging,
and rope were often important items also,
as well as clothing and household furnishings.
