Two of these letters concern the salt supply
in the confederacy. The third concerns a fore-
closure for debt. Although the evidence is
inconclusive, it seems likely that Steadman may
have been a speculator in salt. He also appa-

rently dealt in food and other supplies during

the war. :

Stebbins, Herman, Papers. West Springfield,
Hampden County, Massachusetts

 

Herman Stebbins was probably part of the
Stebbins line whose American progenitor was
Rowland Stebbins (1594-1671). Rowland, who
died at Northampton, was a close friend of
William Pynchon, the founder of the colony at

Springfield, Both Springfield and West Spring-
field are in Hampden County. Luther Stebbins
(d. 1860), who was a seventh generation descen-

dant of Rowland, was a lifelong resident of
Hampden County. He probably was related to

 
Stebbins, Herman 2

 

Herman in some way, perhaps as a cousin, This
information on the Stebbins fami ly was ob-
tained from Alfred M, Copeland's Our Countr
and Its People (Vol. III, pp. 673-674) and
Western Massachusetts: A History (Vol. III,
' p. 402), John H, Lockwood, ed. See also the
Laura W. Stebbins Papers in this department.
This collection came with the McKeen-Duren
Family Papers and the Lyman Whiting Papers.
To the collection was attached an unsigned
note stating that "These with a multitude of

 

 

 
Stebbins, Herman

 

papers were in the stable when I hired the
Stebbins house, They are kept as specimens
of the times,"

The papers are primarily letters to Herman
from his brother Charles and a friend in New
York, Elisa Diggins. Both Charles and Elisa
wrote to Herman after His mother's death in

February, 1816; Elisa wrote at length about
death, The letters also concern man and
woman relationships, particularly a scandalous
affair between one Moner and Miss B. Loveland,

 
Stebbins, Herman 4
Also, Elisa was vocal on the general topic,
referring to the vanity of men and Herman in
particular. Evidently either she or a friend
had been in love with him and then had been
snubbed,

There is one letter from Herman to Elisa in
1815 written from Bryan County, Georgia, where
he had gone to visit an uncle. In it he
described both Savannah and Bryan County
through-which he traveled on his journey. A
letter to Herman on July 2, 1818, concerns

arrangements for the Fourth of July celebra-
tion in Springfield, He was asked to invite,

STEBBINS, Laura W - Letters, 1852-1884,
Springfield, Massachusetts. Sketch.
400 pieces,

 

Laura W. Stebbins, daughter of Clarinda and
Calvin Stebbins, belonged to a family of mod-
erate circumstances, She was a teacher by pro-
fession: she taught in Mississippi, ran her own

school in Mass., taught in public schools in
Mass., and returned to the South after the Civi
War "to teach the colored soldiers."

The letters are from Laura's parents, rela-
tives, friends, pupils, and business associates.

 
STEBBINS, Laura W Sketch 2
They are usually concerned with religion, visits
Sickness, death, funerals, sermons, slavery, and
various cities of the west, to which some of
Laura's friends moved. There is little mention

of the Civil War.
An addition of 400 pieces made April 3, 1942,

does not materially change the color of the
above sketch, but there is certain significant
information which should be added to it:

1. Seweral letters from the vear 1952 (1.e.:
Apr.4, Apr. 21, May 9, May 14, June 25, Aug. 16,
end Oct.3.) give a rather graphic pictume of a

school. Several of the letters contain remarks
on the relative merits of Northern and Southern
teachers for Southern schools.

2. A letter (Mar. 16, 1862) expresses conside
rable Abolitionist sentiment.

3. Civil War letters from Nov. 1862-Feb.1863.
These letters were written to Laura by former vu

 

pils and perhaps distant relatives, although the
exact kinship is not made clear. The boys were
members of the Co. A, 46th Mass. Volunteers.

They were stationed at that time at Newbern, N.C

ilonalt¥ forays. One of them mentions the cap-
ture of Kinston, (N.C.).

4. One of the above-mentioned boys, who alwa
Signed himself "Eugene", was later a member of ft
the Commissary of Subsistance. His 1865 letters
often refer to his duties in this cavacity. At
the close of the War he was transferred to the

 

Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandonnhked
Lands, and his letters from the latter months
of 1865contain interesting discussions on the eu
question of citizenship status for the Negro,
On his standard of “~@ and on his education.

John Steele served as congressman from N.C.
and comptroller of the treasury, 1796-1802. He
was a prominent Federalist and remained active
in N.C. politics until his death in 1815.

This collection consists of a letter to Steele
and one to his son, John Steele, Jr.. The letter
to John Steele has been transferred from the
former William Polk Collection. The letter to
John Steele, Jr., was previously catalogued with
the N.C. Miscellaneous MSS.

 

 
Steele, John 2

On Aug. 27, 1797, William Polk, a soldier and
politician from N.C., wrote Steele a long letter
in which he discussed Gov. William Blount's
plans for an expedition against Spanish troops
in Fla. and La. He revealed may aspects of the
plans and was quite critical of Blount and his
assistant Ezekiel Polk, grandfather of James
Knox Polk. Polk also discussed politics in N.C.
and Tenn.

In a letter of Aug. 20, 1825, Thomas Washing-

ton wrote concerning a suit between John Steele
Jr. and Hugh Dobbins.

This collection is of importance primarily
for the information that 1t contains on the set-

Most of the letters are addressed to Samuel
Steele, who was a person of some prominence in

Augusta County, Virginia. He had as brothers
William Steele of Woodford County, Robert Steele
of Greenbrier County, and John Steele of Natchez

Misgineipyl., ‘

secretary of the Mississippi Territory,

ters describe his journey to Natchez by river
boat under the protection and guidance of the
Cherokee chief, Double Head, and with a Negro,
George, as his man servant. The letters contain
information on the mode of travel, and on the
kind of country, its climate, and the health of

 

the people. The outpost, Natchez, receives some
treatment and a cotton plantation there is fully
described, Mention is made of the cotton gin
and _ cotton prices of 1799 are given,

In that same year John Steele asked Samuel

Steele to gend him his @rrrr” including

 
Steele, Samuel, Sketch, (3)
Negroes, so that he could begin work on his own
Plantation. His great concern for his Negroes
is interesting,

One letter to Samuel Steele is from Samuel
McCorckle, who was a clerk in the court of com-
mon pleas in Washington, the third of Mississip-
pi's counties. The letter, dated June 7, 1800,
was written two days after his appointment.

One letter of March 12, 1814, from Thomas
Moore of Christian County, Kentucky, and anothe
undated letter may be those of Thomas Patrick
Moore who Was later a Kentucky congressman and

The remaining letters, ppread out from 1800
to 1835 contain something of the southern life
of that era, but are not of much importance.

There are three legal agreements in this col-
lection dated 1798, 1833, and 1835, in regard to
possession of land in Virginia,

Steele Family. Papers. Turnersburg, Iredell
County and Mount Airy, Surry County, N.C,

 

Marshall K. Steele was a son-in-law of
Wilfred Turner, an early North Carolina indus-
trialist who was one of the owners of the
Turnersburg Cotton Mills that was established
in Iredell County before the Civil War. Steele

was associated with Turnersburg Mills until
about 1910. Information about him and the
factory is in Homer M. Keever's Iredell Pied-

mont County (1976).

 
Steele Family

Marshall K, Steele was president of the
Steele Bros. Co., a cotton mill at Mount Airy
in Surry County that was incorporated in 1903.
L.C,. Steele was secretary and treasurer, and
N.F. Steele was superintendent, The company
was capitalized at $20,000. See Davison's
Textile Blue Book, 1905-1906

 

 

The Time Book, 1903-1906, contains employee
work records from the Steele Bros. Co. at

Mount Airy. The entries date from June 26, 1903,
to July 20, 1906. Employees are listed with

 
Steele Family ss 3
their wages. There are also figures for the
amount of yarn made each day. This volume was
formerly cataloged incorrectly as belonging to
the Turnersburg Cotton Mills.

Three other volumes were also incorrectly
cataloged as account books from the Turnersburg
Cotton Mills. These volumes were not actual

 

business records but rather exercise books used
in the study of bookkeeping. The student was
apparently LeRoy C. Steele whose name appears

on the inside front cover of one of the volumes
along with the date 1901 and location at

 
Steele Family _ 4
Turnersburg. There are a number of pieces of
evidence that indicate that the volumes were
exercises. The records were kept in a variety
of forms for a variety of businesses, and many
parts were labeled as a "Composition". There
are records from businesses in Lexington,
Kentucky, during 1885-1887, and from others at

 

Turnersburg during 1900-1903. However, the
records from both periods were written in the
same handwriting and colors of ink. Stimpson

and Steele had a general store at Turnersburg
in 1897, but none is listed in the North

 
Steele Family 5
Carolina Year Book during 1900-1903 when there
are records for them in the volumes, "Composi-
tion No. 4" states that Turnersburg Cotton Mills
was incorporated in 1901, and Davison's Textile
Blue Book lists it as established in 1891, The
records include mercantile accounts kept by
single entry, then double entry, and then as

a joint stock company. Figures are too large,
such as $100,000 in cash deposited in the bank
on Jan. 2, 1903.

Steiger-Shriver Family. Papers. Washington,
Die Ge

 

The bulk of the Steiger-Shriver Family
Papers consists of two volumes, Ann Maria S.
Shriver's Diary, 1829-1831, and William Tell
Steiger's Letter Book and Notebook, 1823-1828.
Shriver was the first wife of William Tell

Steiger (1801-1888). According to an obituary
with the collection, Steiger's grandfather,
Andrew Steiger, came from Switzerland in 1716
and settled in Baltimore where he became a

 
Steiger-Shriver Family

 

large landowner. William Tell Steiger was
appointed was appointed to the Patent Office

in Washington in 1833 and by Andrew Jackson in
1835 as principal draughtsman in the General
Land Office in Washington. He entered business
as an attorney for railroad companies in the
mid-1850s and retired to his residence "Bright-

wood" in Howard County, Maryland, in 1884.
According to information from the dealer, from
whom the collection was bought, Shriver (1804-
1848) was a native of Union Mills, Maryland.

 
Steiger-Shriver Family

 

The collection is divided into four cate-
gories: correspondence, 1828-1916, and n. d.;
miscellany, 1860-1887, and n. d.; clippings,
ca. 1909; and volumes, 1823-1831. A separate
folder contains information from the dealer
about the collection.

Ann Shriver's Diary, 1829-1831, gives a

particularly good view of the daily life of an
unmarried woman living with her parents in the
1820s. Shriver was in her mid-twenties during
the course of the diary and lived in Union

 
Steiger-Shriver Family 4

 

Mills, Maryland. Several entries indicate that
she spent several weeks visiting in Hanover,
Carlisle and York, Pennsylvania.

Routinely, she discusses her affection for
William, housekeeping chores she performed,
visiting friends and relatives, taking tea

and information about the comings and goings
of visitors to her parents' home. While the
entries show that she worked very hard herself,
she does indicate (November 9, 1830) that her
family employed servants.

 
Steiger-Shriver Family

 

The approval of William by her father was
very important to her. In January, 1831, she
indicates that her father had no objection to
their getting married, and that now it was up
to them to decide what to do.

She entered her innermost thoughts and
feelings in the diary and occasionally mentions

being blue. While she appeared to be satisfied
and unquestioning of her role as a woman, she
did make two passing references to the differ-
ences in men and women's status. On October 4,

 
Steiger-Shriver Family

 

1830, she mentions that it was election day,
"the boys of course all turned out and we were
left alone all day." On February 14, 1831, she
described a Valentine's Day party she attended
and wrote there were "liquor of all kinds for
the gentlemen."

The diary gives a good description of ague
(malarial fever) and notes a bilious ailment
and their treatment. Her description of the
modes of transportation and of receiving mail
contrast sharply with those of the 20th

century. Her entries end on September 18,

 
Steiger-Shriver Family Zz
1831, two days before she was to marry Steiger.

Steiger's volume (1823-1828) served as both
a notebook and as a letter book. After the
first 330 pages of text, the volume entries are
inverted. Pages 342-355 are detached from the
volume and have been filed with it. Most of
the volume contains copies of letters that he
wrote to Ann Shriver and to her brother William.
Inside the front cover he indicates the diary
will be kept in the manner of Joseph Priestley.
The notebook portion of the volume (June 9,

 

 
Steiger-Shriver Family

 

1823 to July 12, 1824) indicates that he was
studying algebra, rhetoric, chemistry, and
other subjects. Most likely this was kept
during the time he was a student at St. Mary's
College in Baltimore.

The volume's letters (November, 1826 to
April, 1828) indicate that he was trying to

determine what profession he would enter. He
speaks favorably of the law profession, the
book and stationery business and the dry goods
business. He expresses that he wants to be in

 
Steiger-Shriver Family

 

a better position before he and Shriver marry.
On December 12, 1826, he writes of the possi-
bility of inheriting three to four thousand
dollars from his father; he also expects to
inherit some property from his grandfather
Andrew Steiger's estate. In a later letter
(March 23, 1828) it appears that his grand-
father's estate remains unsettled.

Steiger writes affectionately to Shriver
and sensitively to her feelings. Shriver and
Steiger sometimes write in a "private hand" to

 
Steiger-Shriver Family 10

 

each other, and there are a few examples of
this in Steiger's volume. He attended the
Unitarian Church in Baltimore and routinely
critiqued the minister's sermons. He gives a
very good picture of the custom associated with
scrapbooks for young women of the day. Scrap-
books or albums were passed about among the

owner's friends so that they might add poetry,
drawings or other items. Afterwards the scrap-
book was returned to the owner.

Steiger writes why he is a strong supporter

 
Steiger-Shriver Family pi |

 

of Andrew Jackson (January 16, 1828), gives a
vivid account of an autopsy performed on his
sister in August, 1823, and describes an
amusing visit to a live animal exhibit in
Baltimore in 1828, where he sees an orangutan
chewing tobacco.

Other items in the collection include:

from the miscellany folder, pictures of William
T. Steiger, the Shriver's house in Union Mills,
Maryland, and a view of the Steiger's house
near Georgetown, Washington, D. C. It also

 
Steiger-Shriver Family 12
contains the manuscript lyrics for a duet dated February
1, 1860. The clippings folder includes information on
the funeral of Admiral Winfield Scott Schley, a relative
of the Shriver family. Both the miscellany and clippings
folders contain genealogical information about the
Steiger and Shriver families.

 

Ann Maria (Shriver) Steiger was the great-great-
aunt of Sargent Shriver, government official and brother-
in-law of President Kennedy. Her childhood home was
the Shriver family house at Union Mills. Information
about this connection is filed in the Information Folder

Sir Leslie Stephen (1832-1904), author and
philosopher, was the first editor of the
Dictionary of National Biography. He studied
at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became
a tutor in 1856. He was ordained in 1855

 

 

but later relinquished his religious convictions
holy orders, and a tutorship at Cambridge.
Stephen wrote many articles for the Saturday
Review, the Pall Mall Gazette,the Cornhill

 

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie Z

 

Magazine, and other journals. He edited the
Cornhill from 1871 to 1882. His editorship
of the Dictionary followed from 1882 to 1891.
Stephen was as ardent mountain climber. He
visited the Alps on numerous occasions, wrote
about them, and was a principal. member of: the
Alpine Club.

In 1867 Stephen married Harriet Marian
Thackeray, daughter of William Makepeace
Thackeray. She died in 1875, and he married
Mrs. Julia Prinsep (Jackson) Duckworth in
1878. Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell were
two of the children 7 ) second marriage.

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie per tie

The collection consists primarily of family
correspondence and the manuscripts of a number
of Stephen's articles. Although the articles
have been published (with one or two possible
exceptions), the manuscripts remain especially
useful because of problems with the accuracy

 

of the printed texts. Stephen's handwriting

is difficult to decipher, and he once commented
onthe prevalence of textual errors in his
articles. This problem is commented upon by
S.0.A. Ullman, ed., Men, Books, and Mountains,

The correspondence consists almost entirely
of letters to and from Stephen and his closest
relatives from the mid-1860's to the early
1890's. His and Harriet (Thackeray) Stephen's
letters are the most abundant. Other relatives
represented are: Lady Mane Catherine (Venn)]

 

Stephen, Sir Leslie's mother; Caroline Emelia
Stephen, his sister and an author; ~ Anne

The Stephens freaquently omitted dates from
their letters. Later some member or members
of the family supplied dates. This later
dating has usually been found accurate when
verification was possible, and it has been
accepted pending correction. Sometimes one

letter of a series was originally dated, and
others could be dated from it.

The correspondence contains references to
authors and other notables. The more
informative references, but not all of then,

are noted below. "

There is one reference to William Makepeace
Thackeray in an early letter of this collection
It is Harriet Thackeray's comment on his ill
health on July 19, 1861.

An aunt of the second Mrs. Stephen was Julia
(Cameron) Norman (d. 1873), daughter of Julia
Margaret Cameron, the noted photographer, The

 

Camerons were friends of Sir Henry Taylor, the
author, and also the Tennysons, all of whom
lived on the Isle of Wight. A manuscript of a
poem by Taylor, dated April, 1864, at
Farringford, Tennyson’ s home, was written on
the occasion of Sir 6 s meeting

 
 

Stephen, Sir Leslie 9
the young Julia Cameron. It is enclosed with

an undated letter in which Taylor's daughter
attested that the poem was in her father's
handwriting. She also recalled the visits of
Julia and Mrs, Cameron to Sir Henry Taylor. He
discussed his friendship with Julia Norman in
the Autobiography of Henry Taylor 1800-1875

During the Christmas season of 1866 Stephe
revisited Trinity College, Cambridge. Four
letters to Harriet Thackeray contain an
account of this visit. He chatted about a
number of friends and among whom

In 1867 Stephen again visited Cambridge
along with Romer, Fawcett, and Fairrie. Two
years later at aa \s commented from

 

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie a1

 

Cambridge about the Fawcetts, Wolstenholme,
William George Clark, Fairrie, Ritchie, and
others. Sometime in 1867 Stephen also met
with a number of friends at Oxford.

On June 12, 1867, Stephen married Harriet
Thackeray. They then went on a tour of Switz.
during June and July. A series of Harriet's

letters date from this trip. Some of them
include notes in shorthand by Sir Leslie.

In August, 1868, the Stephens left on an
American tour from which they returned in Nov.

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie IZ
Harriet's impressions of the trip are recorded
in a series of letters, some of which include
notes by her husband. In Aug. she commented
on New York City and Saratoga Springs. During
Sept. the Stephens visited the home of

James Russell Lowell, and in her letters home
Harriet chatted about the Lowells and Oliver

 

Wendell Holmes, whom she also met. At Boston
they had dinner with a Putnam family, and
Harriet gave an amusing account of Mrs. Putnam--
Elizabeth H. Putnam, author of a noted

cookbook. Sumner, presumably Charles Sumner, is
also noted. Sir Leslie's letter of Sept. 27

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie L3
in shorthand is studded with the following
surnames: Emerson, Summer, Motley, Eldredge,
and Williams. On Oct. 12 Harriet discussed
Boston, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Charles Sumner,
Later in the month she again visited New York
City. On Nov. 15 she noted Philadelphia and
Baltimore.

In mid-1869 the Stephens and Anne Isabella

 

Thackeray toured parts of Switz., Austria,

and Italy. Most of the letters are Harriet's,
but there are a few from her sister Anne. The
Alps were a favorite region for the Stephens,
and there are letters ry there by either

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie 14

Leslie or Harriet during each year from 1870

to 1875. They usually toured the Swiss Alps,
but the correspondence also recorded visits

in: the French, Austrian, and Italian mountains.
The correspondence cards in the Autograph File
can be used as a guide to the towns they
visited. Stephen sometimes included in his
letters sketches of scenes in the Alps.

In 1870 George Smith, owner of the Pall Mall
Gazette, and his associates, of whom Stephen
was one, attempted to compete with the Times,
and the Gazette appeared as a morning paper for

a few months (see “6 @” 215). Ina letter

 

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie 15
of 1870 Stephen reported on Smith and a new
venture with the Gazette, presumably the
morning edition. Sometime later, Sept. 9, 1871,
he noted Smith's intention to sell his house at
Hampstead. In 1874 Stephen noted a visit with
James Payn, the novelist, and referred to the
arrangements by which Payn became a reader to
Smith, Elder, and Co., the publishing firm of
George Smith,

When Stephen was at Cambridge on Feb. 25,
1872, he remarked about George Trevelyan.
On Aug. 23 of the same year he was in the Alps
and wrote about a who was also

 

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie 16
there. On Sept. 16 he was reading an article
sent him by Arnold. In two letters of Aug. 10
he wrote from Edinburgh about his visit there
with the James Russell Lowells and John Holmes,
On Oct. 10, 1874, Harriet Stephen was
visiting the Isle of Wight, and she commented
on the Tennysons and their two sons, Lionel and
Hallam. On Nov. 25 Sir Leslie was reading a
novel by Millicent Fawcett, the wife of his
friend, Henry Fawcett. He gave a scathing
opinion of both Mrs, Fawcett and her book. In
a letter from London dated only 1874 he
criticized Mary “6 his sister-in-law.

 

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie 17

 

Another letter of 1874 recorded a visit to the
home and studio at Edinburgh of sculptor,
William Brodie, and included a sketch of his
statue of a ram. In another letter from
Edinburgh, he wrote about his visit to the
ailing author, William Ernest Henley. He
reported on Henley's circumstances and stated
an intention to introduce Robert Louis Steven-

son to him.
Harriet Stephen died on Nov. 28, 1875, and

there are a number of letters of condolence
from friends and relatives.
On Nov. 14, 1885, 6 reported on the

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie 13
copyright proceeds from his works and commented
on his recent biography of Henry Fawcett.

Also. on Nov. 14 he referred to his work on

the Dictionary of National Biography. On May
19, 1892, he noted his work at the museum and
the near completion of the"lives."

On Dec. 2, 1893, Elizabeth Robins, American
actress and novelist, thanked Mrs. Stephen for
being allowed to be present at the unveiling
of the James Russell Lowell Memorial, an
occasion at which Sir Leslie spoke.

On the occasion of George Meredith's
seventieth birthday, 6 12, 1898, a group of

 

 

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie 19

 

his friends signed a congratulatory letter that
was published in the Daily Chronicle. on that
day. A clipping of this letter accompanies an
explanatory note by Stephen in which he
commented on Meredith's personality.

A letter of April 14, 1959, is from W.D.
Sturch of the British School at Rome to

 

Vanessa (Stephen) Bell, wife of Clive Bell
(painter) and daughter of Sir Leslie.
The printed material contains a variety of

items. There is a report (Nov. 27, 1895)
from a committee for the establishment of a
memorial to Thomas “ Huxley. It includes

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie 20

 

statements by a number of notable persons
including Stephen. A similar report of Nov.
26, 1900, is about a memorial for Henry Sidg-
wick. A clipping. of 1896 concerns the establis
ment of a fund for the painting of Herbert
Spencer's portrait. Several pages from the
Proceedings of the Alpine Club, Feb., 1899,
concern the election of James Bryce as its

 

 

president. Pages from The Cambridge Review,
Oct. 13, 1900, contain statements about the
late James Porter, master of St. Peter's
College, Cambridge. Proofs or printed copies

 

 
Stephen, Sir Leslie res

of eight of Stephen's magazine articles are
in the printed material. Their titles and
publication information are listed under
Stephen's name in the Autograph File.

The Autograph File also lists twenty-one
manuscripts of articles by Stephen. Most of
them were published in the Cornhill Magazine,
but a few are cited as printed elsewhere.

 

 

An extensive bibliography of Stephen's works
is in Men, Books, and Mountains, Essays by
Leslie Stephen (London, 1956).

e collection, beginning with a letter des-
cribing Stephens’ trip to Washington in 1838 to
begin his first term in the national Congress,
covers a very interesting period. In 1848
Stephens’ quarrel with Judge Cone resulted in
a permanent injury to his hand, which impaired

 

his writing. He opposed the Clayton Compromise
in 1848. In 1848 and again in 1857 he was
appointed to Congress. His comments on the
status of political parties in 1850 are interes
ing, and his lack of enthusiasm for secession is

Steohens, Alexander Hamilton 22
tics, says he thinks Buchanan will let the
people in the territories decide upon the is-
jue of slavery when such territories are ready
to be admitted as states, that Pierce has not
been playing fair, that it would be best for
Kansas to come in as a slave state, and that

 

with fair play it probably will, and puts up
a rather lengthy argument in favor of taking
slaves to Kansas, citing wages for which Ne-
gores could be hired there. In a letter writ-
ten from Crawsfordsville on Sept. 24, 1860 to

 
 

Stephens, Alexander Hamilton 23
Geo. W. Lamar of Augusta he comments on his —
health and his recovery from a fall, predicts

win, and that disunion will perhaps result if
he does. On Sept. 1, 1880 he writes to Chas.
C. Jones, Jr. telling how his library was

scattered during the Civil War, states that he
has letters from Presidents Johnson, Grant,
and Hayes, and refers to the death of his

teph der to _23
Alexander's letter of Jan. 30, 1858 to
his niece Mary Stephens is a reply to her
request for his opinion of her consideration
of marriage to a Dr. Reid. His next two let-
ters to her tell how much money he has given
her for the wedding and advises against ex-

 

travagance. Dr. Reid lived less than four
years after-.their marriage, and on Dec. 23,
1861 Stephens wrote Mary a letter of condo-
lence. In subsequent letters to her, he ad-
vised about the settlement of Reid's estate
and mentioned a ‘el to his own

One item added 2-25-58. Letter of Feb. 29,

1856 from Stephens to Judge Thomas W. Thomas.
Writing from Washington, D. C., where he is a
representative, Stephens surveys the political

scene, He discusses the Kansas situation; the
likelihood that that territory will be a free
state; Gov. Wilson Shannon of that territory;
his own desire, under the circumstances, for
Franklin Pierce's re-election; the sentiments
of others for the presidential aspirations of

 
Stephens, Alexander Hamilton ol

 

James Buchanan and Stephen A. Douglas, and the
undercurrents for Henry A. Wise and R. M, T.
Hunter; North-South tension of slavery; the
"Black Republicans;" and court and sessions in
Georgia. He says that if all professed friends
of the Kansas Bill cooperated on a presidential

candidate they could carry the country by a
large majority and settle the Kansas Question
permanently. He does not believe that Millard
Fillmore and A. J. Donelson are suitable
presidential candidates, because they have no

 
Stephens, Alexander Hamilton

vote-getting strength. Stephens, calling
Robert Toombs the Senate's "ablest debater, "
praises his "great speech yesterday in the
Senate in reply to" J. P. Hale; and says that
Toombs' efforts in this session of the Senate
and his Boston speech have added greatly to

 

his reputation.

l item added 8-5-58; Clipping concerning the
interview between Pres. Hayes and A. H. Stephens
and Gen. P. M. B. Young during which the latter
two urged the appointment of Herschel V. Johnson

1 item added 8-13-58: Letter of Mar. 16,
1847 from A. H. Stephens to an unnamed physician,
He says John C. Calhoun has caused considerable
consternation in Congress by his attitude toward
the Mexican War. He then alludes to the coming
presidential election in 1848 and mentions the
following men in connection with that event:

 

Calhoun, Lewis Cass, Thomas Hart Benton, and one
Wright, possibly Hendrick B. Wright, among the
Democrats; and Finis Ewing McLean, John J.
Crittenden, Zachary Taylor, and Senry Clay, among
the Whigs. He thinks James K. Polk was very

 
Stephens, Alexander Hamilton 34
anxious to get Benton off to war in order to
get him out of the Senate, but he has learned

that Benton is not going.
1 item added 1-21-59: Letter from Alex. H.

Stephens to Col. Thomas W. Thomas of Elberton,
Ga., written on Feb. 29, 1856. The letter deals
primarily with the situation in Kansas and the

 

approaching presidential election. He advocates
running Pierce for a second term, although he
does not regard him as a statesman, and says that
James Buchanan, Stephen A. Douglas, Henry A.
Wise, and R. M. T. Hunter are all being consider-
ed as possible mes nominees, but that

 
Stephens, Alexander Hamilton a5
Millard Fillmore and Andrew J. Donelson have
no strength. He also reports that the
Republicans are in the majority in Ohio, Paes
and N. Y. and praises Toombs for a recent ad-
dress in reply to john Pp. Hale, calling him
the "ablest debater and the most eloquent man
in the Senate."

 

1 item added, 8-26-68: A letter from Ste-
phens to G. Frank Burton concerning the vote on
the admission of Kansas to the union (Apr. 5,

Ann Sophia (Winterbotham) Stephens (1813-
1886), a popular novelist, was also a steady
contributor to literary magazines, held an
editorial position on Graham's Magazine, and
wrote 25 books, "primarily romantic fiction-

The two letters constituting this col-

her letter that appears to be dated 1864, Mrs,
Stephens speaks of a serious illness from
which she is recovering. In the second letter
she proffers her friendship to a young writer,
saying that except for Mrs. Lydia H. Sigour-
ney, whom she regards as an angel, this young

 

writer is the first literary lady to be of-
fered such an abundance of her friendship..
She also speaks of her relations with other

women writers and of her one great fault,
which is unpunctuality.

North Carolina

 

Stephens was born in 1904 in Harnett County,
North Carolina. He was reared on a farm near
Lillington, North Carolina where cotton and corn
were the main crops. From the time he entered
the first grade, he was an avid reader, had an

active imagination and enjoyed writing stories

and poems. He attended Hickory Grove Elementary
School and Lillington Farm Life High School both
located in Harnett County. He attended Trinity

 
Stephens, Erwin Duke a:

 

College which became Duke University during his
senior year, ., 1925.

After graduation, he taught school in Kipling
(near Lillington), North Carolina. He was also
a school principal at Prospect Hill, Bunnlevel
and Holly Springs all located in North Carolina.
He got into the newspaper publishing business in
1933. That year he became writer, newspaper
editor and owner of the Allegheny Times, a news-
paper in Sparta, North Carolina. In 1934, he
became owner of the weekly newspaper The Caswell

 

 

 
Stephens, Erwin Duke 3

 

Messenger. He published, wrote and owned this
paper aS well, and stayed here until his retire-
ment in 1967. Stephens married Mary Lois Senter
from Kipling in 1928.

The collection is divided into four cate-
gories: Memoirs, 1955-1958; Autobiographical
Writings, 1974-1990; Writings, 1931-1984; and

Volumes, 1966-1979. Stephen's Memoirs and Auto-
biographical Writings form the bulk of the col-
lection. They were written over a thirty year
period, 1955-1984, and describe farm life of the
early 1900s in which Stephens was reared. The

 
Stephens, Erwin Duke 4

 

Memoirs category contains 195 typewritten papers
covering such topics as "School" and "Corn
Shuckings" in some detail. The Autobiographical
Writings category is also typewritten. Specific
topics are usually identified but the descrip-
tions are usually brief. This category is
arranged in chronological order. There is some

duplication within these two categories.
Several of Stephen's poems are included in the
collection.

The Writings category includes: index cards
with words and expressions and notes, some of

 
Stephens, Erwin Duke 5
them used in Stephen's work How to Understand
Clodknocker Talk; typed drafts of stories and
poems Stephens wrote; and typed notes for his
pamphlet Nubbins from Fodderstack Ridge. Clod-
knocker talk is a description of the language
used by some rural people in central North

 

 

 

 

Carolina.

The Volumes category includes photocopied
title pages of Stephens's pamphlets How to Dowse
for Underground Water (1979), How to Understand
Clodknocker Talk (1979) and Nubbins from

 

 

 

 

 

 
Stephens, Erwin Duke

 

Fodderstack Ridge (1966). The pamphlets are
located in the Rare Book Room.

There is some discussion of the routine in-
volved with the publication of a weekly newspaper.
Stephens is particularly complimentary of his
wife who assisted him during the time he was in

 

Sparta and the 33 years he published The Caswell
Messenger. The collection gives a good view of
the educational and social opportunities, the
people, customs, living conditions, folklore,
vegetation and animal life in rual Harnett

 

 
Stephens, Erwin Duke

 

County. Of particular interest are his
descriptions of homemade medicinal remedies;
Lillington, N. C.; how tar and turpentine are
harvested from long leaf pines; growing and
picking cotton; a cotton gin; a flour mill;
Malabar Farm in Lucas, Ohio; and his impression
of events surrounding Halley's Comet in 1910.

W. A. Stephens was a private in the 37th
Alabama regiment. In 1863 he was stationed at
Vicksburg, and in 1864 apparently participated
in the campaign from Dalton to Atlanta. Later
he was transferred to Florence, Alabama. His
letters are concerned with news of friends and
Comrads, concern for his wife's welfare and for
the crops at home. He seemed to have almost no

comprehension of the importance of the Campaign

in which he fought.

Stephenson, Wendell Holmes. Papers, 1934-1963,
Kugene, Oregon.

This collection is in two divisions: (1)
General Correspondence, etc., and (2) Journal
of Southern History Archives. The papers, in
the main, run only to 1961, but two of the later
letters ere copies of Prof. Stephenson's letter
of Sept. 21, 1963, and Dr. Powell's reply rel-
ative to the gift of the collection to the
Library. These copies are in a foldér bearing
Stephenson's name which is filed among the
general correspondence.

The papers date from the founding of the

Southern Historical “or in Atlanta

 

 

 
eiephensen, Wendell Holmes oe
and the launching of the Journal of Southern
History. Stephenson was the first editor of
that magazine, and remained associated with it
until 1946, when he became managing editor of
the Mississippi Valley Historical Review. The
latter editorship he surrendered in 1953 when he
left Tulane. He and Charles W. Ramsdell started

 

 

 

 

 

the series entitled A History of the South,and
when Ramsdell died E. Merton Coulter succeeded
him as co-editor of the series. Stephenson,
along with Fred C. Cole, also launched the
Southern Biography Series.

 

 
Stephenson, Wendell Holmes te)

Professor Stephenson taught history at the
University of Kentucky, 1924-36, 1945-46, ana
was editor of the University of Kentucky Press
during the latter year; Louisiana Stete Univer-
sity, 1927-45, and in 1941 became dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences there; Tulane
University, 1946-1953; and University of Oregon
Since 1953. For additional information about
Stephenson see Who's Who in America.

No autograph cards have been made for this
collection, and only a limited number of sub-
ject entries have been made for it. One re-

 

 
Stephenson, Wendell Holmes es
searching on a historian, university or college
president, dean, director of a university press,
editor, et al. should check to see if the person
in whom he is interested has a folder in either
the general correspondence or the archives of
the Journel of Southern History, or both. The
subject entries do not cover remarks about in-

 

 

dividuals for whom there are folders unless they
are mentioned in papers outside their folders.
This rule applies also to institutions, organ-
izations, and publications. In the case of the
latter it would be well for a researcher to-

ex@mine the folders “eres once con-

 
Stephenson, Wendell Holmes
nected with the institution, organization, or
publication in which he is interested.

Whenever a subject entry refers to only one
letter in a thick folder, that letter is cited
specifically. In all other cases the entry may
refer to one or more letters in a folder.

The folders listed on the Subject File cards
are 411 in the general correspondence unless it
is stated on the cards that they are in the
archives of the Journal of Southern History.

The archives are so nearly completely con-
cerned with the writing and publication of manu-

 

 

 
Stepnenson, Wendell Holmes 6
scripts in the Journal that there is less of a
personal nature in them than appears in the gen-
eral correspondence. The personal remarks that
do appear in the archives tend to be confined
to papers within the folders of the individuals
mentioned.

For an indefinite period of time the Subject
File cards for this collection will remain un-
filed and will be in a folder at the beginning
of the general correspondence.

These papers are especially valuable for re-
search in Southern historiography and for know-

Several Poes are mentioned, E. G., Neilson
Poe (letter of Oct. 14, 1854),

While many subjects are discussed in this
collection, it is valuable chiefly for the light
which it sheds upon U. 8S. Aimy politics and Md.
social life, both in the 1850's; and politics
in the U. 8S. and Md. in:/1860-1861. There is

 

relatively little discussion of the Mexican and
Civil wars. The elder Gen. Steuart seems to

have taken part in neither, but he was an ardent
Confederate sympathizer. Gen. Steuart, Jr. was

-€raduated from the U. S. Military Academy in

 
Steuart, George Hume, I and II... 6
1848 and did not participate in the Mexican
War. In 1851 an army court-martial convicted
him of insubordination and punished him lightly.
In 1855, due to his father's political influence
he was promoted to lst. Lt. and then to Capt.
In April '61, he was appointed a general by the
State of Maryland. In June '61, a Lt. Cd.,

he was sent to Harper's Ferry by Johnston, In
July, '61, a Col. at the Battle of Bull Run,

he was taken prisoner, but after several hours
he was recaptured at the Stone Bridge. In May
and June, '62, he commanded the 2nd. and 6th

 

 
Steuart, George Hume, I and II _. 7
Va. Cavalry in Jackson's Valley Campaign, and
was wounded at the Battle of Cross Keys. In
Sept. '62, he was in the Battle of Crompton's
Gap, the day before the Battle of Sharpsburg,
after which he was promoted to the rank of
brigadier-general, and ordered to proceed to
Fredericksburg and assume command. In Dec. '63,
he retreated from Winchester. In Jan. '63, he
commanded the first Mo, Inf., the First Md. Cav,
and the Baltimore Light Artillery at Edinburg,
Va. In May '63, he was ordered to command a

brigade in Johnson's division of A. P. Hill's

 

 

 
Steuart, George Hume, [ and II . 8
Corp. In July '63, he stormed Oulp's Hill in
the Battle of Gettysburg, and remained in the
Army of Northern Va. during the suceeding sum-
mer, In May '64, a Major-General, he was cap-
tured in the Battle of Spottsylvania by Han-
cock's Division and was sent to Hilton Head,
S. C. from Fort Delaware. In Aug. '64, on ex-
Change, he was assigned to the command of Bar-
ton's Brigade in Lee's Second Army Corps.,
under Early, at Appomattox. After the War, he
was a farmer, He was the last survivor of the
nine Confederate generals from Md,

 

 
Steuart, George Hume, I and II . 9

He was the senior Brigadier at the Battle of
Five Forks (1865), where Gen. G. E. Pickett
could not be found. Steuart refused to take
command of Pickett's troops, but did command
his own Brig. in the battle. The Brig. held
the center of the Confederate line until it was
out flanked.

"Warburton Manor,” across the Potomac from
Mount Vernon. The Steuarts lived at "Dodon,"
near Annapolis and their town house was located
where the Executive Mansion now stands in
Annapolis. By 1833 Colonel George Hume Steuart
was in Baltimore. He drafted a letter on

Jan. 27, 1833, to Washington Irving, who had
returned from a visit to the West with Charles
Joseph Latrobe (1801-1875). Irving came to
Washington, Db. C., on Dec. 10, 1832, and
remained three months. George Hume Steuart

wrote to Irving to ask him to visit at the
Steuart home in Baltimore. Actually Irving

did make “a short excursion” to Baltimore

while in Washington. On his way home in

March, 1833, Irving wrote he "got detained

most delightfully at Baltimore for three weeks
by the extreme hospitality of the inhabitants."

Benjamin C,. Stevens was born in Franklin,
N. H., in 1839, and was a machinist by trade.
On Aug. 22, 1861, he enlisted in the First
Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers as a mem-
ber of the regimental band. He served in Mary-

land and Virginia until Sept. 7, 1862, when he
was mustered out under General Orders No. 91.
He returned to N. H., but in 1863 he became a
hired member of a band attached to Gen, Alfred

 
Stevens, Benjamin C. 2
H, Terry's brigade stationed on Hilton Head, S.
C. At the end of August, 1863, he resigned his
job and returned home. After the war he was a
machinist in Tilton, N. H.

This collection consists of letters written
by Stevens to his family and of clippings,
largely undated and unidentified,

 

The letters begin in Aug., 1861, when Stevens
was at Camp Union, Bladensburg, Md. In Oct.,
he moved to winter quarters at Camp Hooker,
Budd's Ferry, Md., on the Potomac. These letters

 
stevens, Benjamin C,
deal mainly with details of camp life. Stevens
mentions the activities of the regimental band,
the observation balloons sent up by the Union
Army, religious services, contrabands, and the
Confederate Army encamped on the other side of
the river. In April, 1862, the army began the
Peninsular Campaign. Stevens' band went to

 

Fortress Monroe, Va., and moved northward with
the army. He writes about the seige of Yorktown
(April, 1862) and the Battle of Williamsburg
(May 5, 1862). Stevens himself did not take

 
stevens, Benjamin C, an

 

part in any fighting. In late May he was ina
hospital in Williamsburg convalescing from an
unnamed illness, and shortly afterwards he was
moved to the U. S. hospital in Portsmouth Grove,
R. I. In Sept., 1862, he was mustered out of
the army, under General Orders No. 91, which
drastically reduced the number of bands in the

army. However, in 1863 he became a hired member
of a band serving with Gen. Terry's brigade at
Hilton Head, S. C. His letters from S. C. deal
with camp life and the band's activities. In
July, 1863, the brigade moved to Morris Island,

 
Stevens, Benjamin C. 5

 

S. C., and began the siege of Charleston.
Stevens writes about the encampment on Morris
Island and the bombardment of Ft. Sumter and the
other Confederate batteries and forts in the
vicinity. Hating the fighting and fearful for
his safety, in late Aug., 1863, he resigned from
the band and returned home.

The folder of clippings contains references
to Union hospitals, balloons, the siege of York-
town, and Camps Union and Hooker. An almost
complete copy of The New South (May 16, 1863),

a newspaper of Port Royal, S. C., was trans-
ferred to the ———— et:

Stevens, Frederick M. Papers, 1862-1865.
New Orleans, Orleans Parish, La.

 

The main item in this collection is a
summary of reminiscences, 12 pages in length,
written by Mrs. Frederick M. Stevens toa
friend. The content of this account includes
firsthand observations on the siege of

Vicksburg, as well as a personal history

of the Stevens marriage. The account was
written soon after the death of Frederick
Stevens in 1870, and the recollections of Sara
Stevens are still fresh and vivid.

 
Stevens, Frederick M. 2

 

Mrs. Sara Stevens was originally a native
of Dublin, Ireland, where her father had been
a lawyer before immigrating to the U.S. Her
Ewropean education included music, French, and
Italian, subjects she was to teach in the
American South. At 19 she married a Mr.
Jackson of New Orleans, but was left a widow

two years later. At age 25, after a two-year
courtship, she married Frederick Stevens, a
teacher at Oakland College, Mississippi. Sara
was teaching in a nearby private home at the
time of their courtship. Frederick, a native

 
Stevens, Frederick M. 3

 

of Connecticut and a sraduate of Yale, was
evidently well versed in music, Latin, and
Greek. When the Civil War commenced, Stevens,
then 37, had been teaching in Mississippi
schools for ten years. He was then principal
of a female academy in Vicksburg, which was
soon either closed down or re-located. By

early 1862 he and Sara, with two young children,
were in New Orleans, connected with a select
finishing school for young ladies. Sara's

account of the war begins there with her
departure from New Orleans by steamer, prior

 
Stevens, Frederick M. 4

 

to the siege. This departure is described

in some detail, and is followed by an account
of the Vicksburg siege. Deéscriptions include
the use of caves as dwellings, the mutilation
and mangling of civilians, prices, and substi-
tutes. A touching incident is that of the
kindness shown by a Union soldier, a former

friend of Stevens, who supplied the family
with food. An appraisal of General U.S. Grant
states that he.was "... universally liked

and respected... for his sense of justice,
kind heart, and gentlemanlike deportment as

 
Stevens, Frederick M. *

a commander." High praise is also given to
Federal Gen. James B. McPherson, later killed
during the Atlanta Campaign.

With the Federal occupation of Vicksburg
certain articles became so scarce that
Southerners were obliged to cross the Union
lines to obtain them. One lady was found by

 

her sutler lover. to be concealing items in
her hoop skirt.

Sara Stevens continues with an account
of the insurance provisions her husband had
made for his family before his death, at still

 
Stevens, Frederick M,. 6

 

a relatively young 46. The family had moved
North to live in 1866.. Stevens seems to have
been working for an Insurance Company (American
Life), getting the "Southern States into
working order for the Co."

In addition to the account already described
the papers include: Stevens! exemption from

the Mississippi militia (on the basis of his
being a teacher); two certified oaths of
allegiance to the U.S. (one at Vicksburg, Oct.
30, 1863; the other June 14, 1865); two
travel passes, Vicksburg to New Orleans, (Nov.

 
Stevens, Frederick M. 7

5, 1863, Jan. 18, 1864); and a certificate of
enrollment, New Orleans, March 31, 1865, which
lists Stevens' occupation as a clerk. A

final item probably relates to the ancestry of
Sara Stevens. An undated copy, it concerns a
Dr. Frederick Drewry, Magistrate in Ireland, who
was active in suppressing the insurrections

of 1798 and 1803.

Williamsville Township, Bath County, Va.

1 volume

-23-81
See also bound vol. card)

 
Stewart, Henry. Papers. Williamsville Town-
ship, Bath County, Virginia

 

The volume is Ledger C, 1866-1871, of a gen-
eral store. The accounts date primarily from
1868, many of them dating from January 1, 1868,
when they were noted as continued in this vol-
ume from Ledger B. Earlier and later entries

are sufficiently numerous, however, that they
cannot be ignored in dating the volume. Goods
are itemized by name, quantity, and price, and
this extensive ledger is thus a good source of

 
Stewart, Henry 2

 

commodity prices in this western Virginia count
in the midst of Reconstruction. Various ser-
vices can also be found in the entries. Many
of the entries later than 1868 are for interest
payments and settlements of accounts. The ac-
counts are not noted as continued into a Ledger
D. For these reasons, it appears that the

store either closed or, more likely, passed in-
to new ownership in 1868 or 1869. The extent
of the accounts and the care in which they were
kept indicate that the store was substantial.

 
Stewart, Henry 3 *

 

The lettering "C & S" on the spine of the
ledger indicates that ownership was a partner-
ship. One of the partners was Henry Stewart
who has an extensive account. Significantly,
Stewart's account (p. 539) includes entries for
transactions with John McClintic for hauling

wheat and with Jasper C. Lewis for the purchase
of wood. These transactions are entered in
McClintic's (p. 330) and Lewis's (p. 293) ac-
counts as credits against their debts to the
store. These entries indicate that Stewart was

 
Stewart, Henry 4
one of the owners. Staff at the Virginia State
Library discovered Henry Stewart listed as a
merchant in the Eastern District of Bath County
in the returns of licenses among the State Au-
ditor's records. He was also listed in state
records as the treasurer of the county in 1871.
They did not find "C & S" in the Virginia State
Business Directory for 1871/72 published by
Benjamin Bates, but the ledger accounts indicate
that the partnership was no longer operative
then. Stewart does not appear in the 1870 cen-

 

 

 

 
Stewart, Henry

 

sus of the county. Interestingly, merchant
James N. Potts of Williamsville Township is
listed with two Stewart children included in
his household.

The identity of "C," Stewart's partner, is
still unknown. Some pages from the "C" section
of the ledger are missing. The census of 1870

lists a merchant named John W. H. Coursey in
Williamsville Township. Cawthorn & Moore were
merchants in the Eastern District of the county
in 1863 according to licenses among the State

 
Stewart, Henry 6
Auditor's records.

William Smith's account (p. 474) is closed
in 1869, and the balance due was "Credited to
Stewart & McDannalds Books" (a successor firm?) .

The location of the store is also a problem.
A few place names such as Williamsville (p.

297) appear in entries. Williamsville is in

 

northern Bath County near the border with High-
land County. Oren F. Morton's Annals of Bath
County Virginia includes a roster of Confederate
soldiers many of whom can be found listed in

 

 

 
Stewart, Henry a”
this ledger (6 of 9 McClintic's, for example).
Prosperous farmer Robert J. Glendy of Clover-
dale and some of his neighbors in the census
have accounts. Glendy has an extensive account.
Cloverdale is in the northeast part of the
county, eastward across a mountain area from
Williamsville. Glendy is listed for Cloverdale

 

in Chataigne's Virginia Business Directory and
Gazetteer . . . 1877-78. The entry on p. 297
of the ledger, "Grain Furnished at Williams-
ville," suggests that the store was elsewhere.

 

 
Stewart, Henry 8
However, Chataigne's Directory lists three
millers at Williamsville, two of whom have ac-
counts in the ledger, and four of the six farm-
ers in that vicinity can also be found in the
accounts.

The accounts of William H. McDannald (p.348)
and George Mayse (p. 345) are especially signif-

 

icant. They reveal that McDannald worked in
the store and boarded with Mayse. The 1870
census also lists McDannald (no occupation
given) in the George Mayse household.

 
Stewart, Henry 9

 

Chataigne's Directory lists Mayse and a John
McClung as farmers near Bath Alum southeast of
Williamsville and Cloverdale near the center of
the county. However, McClung, Robert J. Glendy,
and Mayse are all listed in Williamsville Town-
ship as households 132, 139, and 155, respec-
tively. So, it is unclear whether or not the
store was in one of these towns or somewhere in
the countryside. The store definitely was in
Williamsville Township and apparently near the
Mayse farm that was probably located somewhere

 
Stewart, Henry 10
between Bath Alum and Williamsville in the north
central or northeast part of the county.

The papers of Copeland Stiles of Charleston,
S.C., concern his beginning in 1813 2s a planter
on an estate on St. John's Island, S.C.,
which had been the property of his grandmother,
Mrs. Smilie. There is a statement of the
shares of Mrs. and Miss Stiles in an estate,
most probably that of Copeland Stiles' father,
as Hugh Wilson in mentioned. He seems to have
administered the Stiles' legal business.

Of interest in this small collection is a
printed copy of a “eo poem written in

This collection begins with letters to Joseph
Stiles, Sr. of Savannah regarding the dismissal
of his sons, Benjamin and Joseph, Jr., from
Princeton and their attempt to enter Yale. The
letter concerning their attempt to gain admis-

sion into the latter institution lists the sub-
jects which were supposed to be mastered by
students before they entered the freshman and
sophomore classes at Yale,

There is a letter of July 20, 1855 recommen-

later letter to him from Theo. W. Dwight, pro-

Much of the correspondence in this collection
is from Robert's mother, It'is of a deeply re-
ligious nature and yields nothing of signifi-
cance about Gonditions in the Confederacy and
during Reconstruction. His father was a mini-
ster.

There are copies of letters from Stonewall
Jackson recommending Bradley T. Johnson for

In Sept., 1863 Znd. Lieut. Robt. Stiles was
assigned as adjutant in Col. Cahell's battalion
of the Army of Northern Va. Before the war
ended he had become a major. His letters reveal

Charles Warren Stoddard (1843-1909) lived much
of his life in California, but also traveled
widely. These letters are chiefly on literary
matters, some of them being written by Stoddard
in his youth to prominent writers. They also

contain considerable biographical information.
There is one manuscript poem and copies of
three early poems published in San Francisco

papers. All items are photostatic copies of

 
Stoddard, Charles Warren

 

originals preserved in various libraries.

1 item added (transferred from Misc. File):
On April 11, 1870, Stoddard wrote to William
Hepworth Dixon to invite him to California and
to comment on a book by Dixon.

1 item added, 12-9-70: A letter to Stoddard
from Paul Hamilton Hayne, September 8, 1877.

Hayne commented on Stoddard's literary talents

and on his own writings, noting that Swinburne

had particularly liked one of his poems, a copy
ofwhich he sent to Stoddard.

Hope Stoddard, poet and writer, was born in
New Bedford, Massachusetts, March 31, 1900.
Before going to the University of Michigan she
had lived in Mt. Vernon, New York; Yellow
Springs, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan;

Indianapolis, Indiana; and New York City, New
York. While living in New York she studied
music at the Juilliard School of Music. Her
major interest was the violin. While attending
the University of Michigan from 1919 to 1923,
Ms. Stoddard met and submitted a few poems to

 
Stoddard, Hope 2

 

Robert Frost who was in 1922 "Poet in Resi-
dence." Frost encouraged her to consider poet-
ry as a lifetime career. After graduation in
1923 with a degree in journalism, however, she
taught in a New Hampshire country school and
did various kinds of office work until 1926
when she began work on the editorial staff of
The Etude Music Magazine. She remained in that
capacity until 1934 when she went to Europe to
teach English in the Berlitz Schools in Copen-
hagen, Denmark and Hamburg, Germany. She also
did some teaching privately in Bern, Switzer-

 

 
Stoddard, Hope 3
land. Returning to America in 1936, Ms. Stod-—
dard taught English in the Berlitz School in
New York City until. June 1940 when she moved to
New Jersey and became editor of the magazine
The International Musician. She remained in
that position until 1965 when she retired and
moved back to New York City.

In 1972 Ms, Stoddard wrote to John Hall
Wheelock commenting on his book By Daylight and
Dreams. Thus began a lively correspondence be-
tween the two.

The Stoddard papers include the letters,

 

 

 

 
Stoddard, Hope 4
both his and hers, exchanged between Stoddard
and John Hall Wheelock. From 1975 to 1978
there are few Wheelock letters. He suffered
severe back pain and was unable to write easily:
therefore, he answered Ms. Stoddard's letters
by telephone. Scattered throughout the corre-
spondence are poems by each of the poets.

 

The subject matter of the letters is predom-
inantly poetry, criticism of poetry, versions
of poems, and the art of reading a poet's work
aloud. Ms. Stoddard typed and prepared the
manuscript copies for publication of Wheelock's

 
Stoddard, Hope 5

 

last books, Afternoon: Amagansett Beach (1978)
and This Blessed Earth (1977). Wheelock edited
Stoddard's selections and arranged them in
their final sequence for her book The Curve of
Time which was published in 1975.

“Ms. Stoddard is the author of From These
Come Music (1952), The Noon Answer (Poems) ,
Famous American Women (1970), Symphony Conduc-
tors of the United States (1957), and Subsidy
Makes “Sense (1961) in addition to The Curve of

Time (1975).

make up the Stoddard papers to date. The cor-

Stokes, Inez Duke (Angier). Papers.
Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky

 

This collection was given to the Manuscript
Department by Inez Stokes, daughter of Jonathan
Cicero Angier and Lida Aurelia (Duke) Angier.
Lida was the daughter of John Taylor Duke, a
brother of Washington Duke. Mrs. Stokes was

the wife of Earl Monroe Stokes, who was for
many years associated with the British-American
Tobacco Company.

The collection is divided into three cate-

 
Stokes, Inez Duke (Angier) 2
gories genealogy, pictures and a scrapbook.
There are five family photographs. Sarah Pear-
son Angier, sister of Jonathan C. Angier who
married Benjamin N. Duke; Jonathan C. Angier;
the girls of Jonathan and Lida Angier; Lida
Angier and her boys; and the boys and girls of

 

Jonathan and Lida Angier.

The genealogical information includes photo-
copied pages from John Duke's Bible and remi-
niscences by Lida A. Duke of her family, in-
cluding comments about James, Benjamin and

 
Stokes, Inez Duke (Angier) 3
Washington Duke.

The scrapbook dating from 1897-1964 includes
newspaper and magazine clippings, most of them
relating to the James B. and Benjamin N. Duke
families. Clippings covering marriages, deaths
and will stipulations of family members are

 

particularly prevalent. There are also several
articles written in tribute to the Duke family
and their relationships with Trinity College
that later became Duke University. Other phil-
anthropic endeavors are also noted. For example

 
Stokes, Inez Duke (Angier) 4
there is an invitation from Lincoln Memorial
University in Harrogate, Tennessee, to attend
the laying of the cornerstone to the B. N. Duke
Hall of Citizenship.

Several items relate-to various activities
which took place on the Duke University campus.
A few of them: a printed program for the cere-

 

mony of laying the first cornerstone on the new
campus of Duke University, June 5, 1928; a news
clipping about the newly created Sarah P. Duke
Memorial Gardens, dated March 3, 1935, and an

 
Stokes, Inez Duke (Angier) 5
early picture of the gardens from the Duke
Alumni Register; pictures and an article about
the Duke Homestead which was accepted on behalf
of Duke University at commencement exercises
June 3, 1935; and photographs from the Duke
Alumni Register of the Duke Centennial Cele-

 

 

 

bration, April 21-23, 1939.

There is extensive information about Doris
Duke, only child of James Duke. There are many
clippings about her marriage to, honeymoon with

 
Stokes, Inez Duke (Angier) 6
and divorce from James H. R. Cromwell, a social
ly prominent businessman from New York. He be-
came ambassador to Canada during their marriage
and ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in New
Jersey. There are also a few articles about
her later marriage and divorce from Porfirio

 

Rubirosa.

The news clippings about Doris Duke are re-
vealing. They illustrate how thoroughly and
constantly her movements and actions were re-
ported upon in the press. Items are included

 
Stokes, Inez Duke (Angier) Z

- about her in several Walter Winchell columns
and in cartoons. Comparisons are made between
her and Barbara Hutton, another wealthy heiress.
Activities such as her visiting Duke incognito
for a few days in April, 1936, her work as an
unpaid research assistant at the University of

 

North Carolina School of Public Health in June,
1943, and her work in New Orleans as a worker
for the United Seamen's Service in 1944 are
reported in newspaper clippings. The scrapbook
provides an interesting insight into the

 
Stokes, Inez Duke (Angier) 8
history of Duke University. More particularly,
it provides information about members of the
Duke family who brought about its birth.

Because the scrapbook is in such bad physical
condition, it has been photocopied. The pages
of the original scrapbook have been placed in

 

Mylar folders and consecutively numbered.
Numbers on the photocopied pages correspond with
the number of the page on which they appear in
the scrapbook. Researchers are requested to

use the photocopied version rather than the

 
Stokes, Inez Duke (Angier)
original when working with the collection.

Stokes, Missouria H. Letters and Papers, 1856-
1924. Decatur, De Kalb Co., Ga. (from
Clifton Newton Collection)

 

These letters, formerly listed under Clifton
Newton's name revolve around the lives of Miss
Missouria H. Stokes and her sister[?] Miss Mary
A. H. Gay, two pious females interested in chure
work and temperance. A few letters were written
by Mary M. Stokes, evidently a sister-in-law, and
her son "Tommy." But for the most part the col
lection consists of letters from Mary Anne Harris
Gay (1829-__-) to her sister. The letters re-

 
Stokes, Missouria H. 2

 

flect poverty and petty business deals. Mary A.
H. Gay traveled in the South selling a book
called "The Pastor's Story." Numbers of the let
ters also come from ministers of the gospel and
fellow workers in the Woman's Christian Temper-
ance Union. Frequent mention is made of Frances
Willard. Mrs. W. C. Sibley (also signed as J.

E. Sibley) was the most ardent of the fellow
temperance writers. "

One expecially interesting letter dated "June
1868" describes, with righteous indignation,
fraternizing of “Yankee school marms" with

 
Stokes, Missouria H.
Negroes in the railroad station at Atlanta.
Mary A. H. Gay was the author of Life in
Dixie During the War (Atlanta, 1897.)
Recatalogued and 16 items added 3-2-61. Miss
Missouria H. Stokes was perhaps a school teacher
for a time, but this collection has almost
nothing on the subject. She was enthusiastic

 

 

in her support of the temperance movement and

in 1890 was corresponding secretary of the Ga.
Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Miss Mary
M. Stokes was apparently her sister. T. H.

 
Stokes, Missouria H. Sie
Stokes was apparently their nephew. See letter
of June 8, 1885.

A number of letters are exchanged among the
Misses Stokes and an authoress, Miss Mary Ann
Harris Gay (1827- +). +The collection consists
mainly of personal letters about personal, tem-
perance, and religious affairs.

The chief value of the collection lies in the
information on the temperance movement in Gea.

Correspondents include two Ga. temperance
devotees, J. E. Sibley (Mrs. W. C. Sibley); and

 

 
Stokes, Missouria H.
Mrs. Sarah Virginia (Hart) Sibley (iste
also known as “Jennie"(Hart) Sibley, wife of
Samuel Hale Sibley (1835-1883) In 1890 the
former was president of the Ga. W. C. T. Ue3
and in 1901 she was honorary president, while
the latter was president.

Persons mentioned include Miss Frances

Elizabeth Carolina Willard (1839-1898), president
of the national W. C. T. U. (1879-1898). The
Candler, Pattillo, and Pennington families of
Ga. and the Perry family of S. C. come in for
some discussion. Subjects mentioned include

 
Stokes, Missouria H. 6
the Sons of Temperance.

The first letter in the. collection gives
some discription of Harmony Male and Female
Academy, near Calhoun, S. C. in 1857.

Some letters are by Thomas Stanley Beckwith,
a@ Virginia businessman and an alumnus of the
University of Virginia.

 

 

A letter of March 13, 1867 is by a student
attending Ga. Female College in Madison, Ga.
See also letters of Sept. 7, 1867; and May 13,
1873, relative to that school.

Miss Mary Ann Harris Gay writes in June, 1860

 
Stokes, Missouria H. ah pune) SSS
about a scene in the Atlanta Railroad Station
featuring fraternization between white southern
women teachers and Negro men.

A letter of Feb. 5, 1869, discusses fhe Rev.
Dr. John Watrus Beckwith (1831-1890), Second
Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Georgia.

Miss Vay's letter of “arch 13, 1870 deals

 

with more trouble on the railroads, developing

school in Decatur. Some items deal with books
and booksellers, e. g., a bill of April 14, 1873
to Miss Gay for 100 copies of her Pastor's
Story.

Missouria writes on Aug. 3, 1877 about a
"free" school in Decatur, Ga.,; and two Missis-
Sippi lawyers, B. F. Worsham and Col. William

C. Falkner (1826-1889), the latter the great
grandfather of William Harrison Faulkner.

Miss Gay's letter of April 19, 1879, written
to some extent in a poetic vein, pays tribute to
the memory of Charlotte (Bronté) Nicholls (1816-

 
Stokes, Missouria H. patter ero ty oe ont
1855).

A letter of J@ly 15, 1881 discusses the
temperance cause and the Ga. Gen. Assembly.

A letter of Feb. 6, 1883 discusses the
possibility of securing legislation in several
States on the temperance question. Other letters
dwell upon the same thems.

 

The trials, tribulations, and financial
difficulties of a temperance worker are discussed
on May 3, 1883

A pamphlet of 1884 deals with the Plan of

A letter of June 8, 1885 discusses a
religious revival in Atlanta, legal affairs, and
U. S. Interior Sec. L. Q. C. Lamar, Jr.

A bill of June 10, 1887 is from the
Woman*s Temperance Publication Association.

There, is a printed letter of Dec. 31, 1887
by Mrs. Mary H. Hunt, superintendent of the

solicits the assistance of her W. G. T. U.
sisters in a high pressure campaign to make
Congress enact a compulsory temperance
education law. The surplus in the national
treasury is to be used, presumably, to educate
illiterates into voting for prohibition.

A letter of May 3, 1892 discusses the
establishment of the W. Cc. T. U.

There is a good letter of Oct. 4, 1901, from
a teacher in a girls*® boarding school, the Sans
Souci School, on the "Sans Souci" Plantation,
near Greenville, S. C. The head mistress of the

school and manager of the plantation is Mrs.
William Hayne Perry, wife of a former U. S.
Representative from S. @. and daughter-in -law
of Benjamin Franklin Perry, reconstruction Gov.

Wesleyan Christian Advocate, writes to Missouria

 

on June 6, 1902.

Anti-Catholic predgudice is expressed in a let

A letter of 1924 discusses the U. S. Bureau
of Mines, Woodrow Wilson, and W. G. Harding.

 
Stokes, Missouria H. 13

An undated letter discusses temperance and
the Ga. Gen assembly; and goes on to mention one
of the four marriages of Mrs. Helen Louise
(Leonard) Braham Solomon Chatterton Moore (1861
1922), better known by her stage name of Lillian
Russell. Miss Russell has gone to a new field
of labor, Savannah, where, our correspondent

 

hopes, God has led her. The Singer's name is in
two other undated letters, both times with her
address being listed as Augusta, Georgia. An-
other undated letter praises her efforts.

An undated letter discusses a train wreck on

 
Stokes, Missouria H.
the Danville R. R.

In a printed leaflet there is an address of
1884 to the Committee on Resolutions of
the Republican National Convention by Miss
Frances E. Willard, president of the W. Cc. T. U.
The Republican party, like all others, is urged
to adopt union's prohibition plank, which
called for an amendment to the U. S. Constitu-
tion. State Senator William G. Donnan (1834-
1908), of Iowa, presented the plank to the
Republican National Convention.

The leaflet displays some prejudice against

 

 
Stokes, Missouria H. ae
the Church of the Latter Dsy Saints, and says
that the W. C. T. U. has endorsed the prohibi-
tion party.

The leaflet contains a letter to the local
unions of the W. C. T. U. from Miss Willard and
from Mrs. Carolina (Brown) Buell (1843-1927),
corresponding secretary of the national organi-
zation. The Republicans blame the Prohibition
Party for the Democratic victory of Nov., 1884.
Some"fellows of the baser sort" hang in effigy
the Prohibition Party presidential candidate,

former Gov. John Pierce St. John (1833-1966),

 

 
Stokes, Missouria H. 16

 

of Kansas. The letter pleads for tolerance
toward the intolerant.

There is one undated Confederate soldier's
letter, which seems to have nothing to do with
the rest of the collection. The soldier op-
poses the election of Joseph Emerson Brown as
governor of Georgia and says that he would have
been defeated if the Georgia soldiers in Vir='
ginia had been home to vote. C. S. Gen. Ben-
jamin Huger (1805-1877) is mentioned.

He probably lived at or near Youngsville (for-
merly Pacific), for the name of that town is
given with his name and the date of Sept. 15,
1873, on one of the pages. Pacific is also

given as the location in the Union Debating
Society's minutes of Aug. 29, 1855.
The Account Book, 1854- -1885, includes a

variety of records, and each type of record is

usually scattered about the book.

The volume begins with the constitution and
by-laws of the Union Academy Debating Society
and the minutes of its meetings during 1854-
1855. Accounts for tuition, lists of scholars,
books used at the school, and an agreement
between Stone and the subscribers are scattered

 

about the book. These records date during 1858-
1865. Mary A. Stone also taught in the school.
Other accounts of 1860-1885 are for cotton

crops, persons employed by Stone, and the

These are letters chiefly addressed to Will-

Church. The first letter written by J. S.
Kidder, a student at Andover Theological Sem-
inary, discusses the faculty and curriculum of

that institution, questions of doctrine, a

camp meeting, the recent World Abolition Conv-
ention, women's rights and news of friends and
fellow students. Othe letters discuss school
teaching and the prospects for teachers in var-

lous localities. “@ refers to a hearing

in the case of a minister suspended from service
in the church, In another letter the New Eng-
land Female Moral Reform Society of Boston asked
Stone to address it on an appropriate topic.
Stones wife was Phoebe W(Robinson?)Stone. A few
letters of he brother Dr. C. M. Robinson,
discuss teaching as an occupation, refer to

 

personal matters, mentions Charles Burleigh, the
abolition lecturer, and ccntemplates going West.

These few letters reflect the New England
attitude toward religion and reform and repres-
ent the viewpoint of educated persons.

This collection is chiefly concerned with the
Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Associa-
tion, with headquarters in the Grant Building,
in Atlanta; Stone Mountain, in De Kalb County,
about 16 miles east of Atlanta; and a controvers

of ca. 1925-1927 centering around a famous
sculptor, Gutzon-Borglum, who was dismissed by
the Association; Augustus Lukeman, who replaced
him; and alleged mismanagement of funds.

 
2
Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association
The first item, is a statement by the Asso-
ciation's Executive Committee of the reasons it
deemed it necessary to dismiss Borglum from the
projected plan for making Stone Mountain into
&@ monument to the C. S. A. Borglum was accused
of various offenses, including falsehood and
fraud. After carving the head of Gen. Robert

 

E. Lee, unveiled on Jan. 19, 1924, he allegedly
virtually abandoned the work. He allegedly
accused the South of "Yellow-Livered treason to
the Union” during the late War Between the

States.. Some undated items in the collection
deny these charges.

The committee members were Col. Hollins

Association), Eretus Rivers (1872-19 __), Mrs.
‘Mildred (McPheeters) Inman, Eugene Robert Black,

Allen, and William Candler, Sr. (1890-1936).
These and other personalities figured prominentl
in the prolonged and futile controversy about
what to do with Stone Mountain, what sculptor

 

should do it, who owned the Mountain, what to

do with the inadequate funds raised for the
Memorial project, and who, if anybody, mismanaged
the Association's and other funds.

 
Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association
Two anonymous items in The American Standard

(May 15, 1925; Vol. 11, No. 10) bestow upon the

Stone Mountain project a venemous and ill-in-

formed contempt. An article on pp. 226-227

upholds Borglum and assails Jefferson Davis,

the C. S. Aw, the Roman Catholic Church, and the

 

Society of Jesus. A poem on p. 227 praises
Abraham Lincgln and slanders Robert E. Lee.
A volume published by the S. M. G. M. A.
ca. 1925 details plans for vast Confederate
Memorials on, in, and near Stone Mountain.

The Board of Directors include many famous names
northern as well as southern. Augustus Lukeman
is named as the sculptor to succeed the dismissed
Borglum. The predominant figures on the moun-
tain are to be Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee,
and Thomas Jonathan Jackson. On pp. 26-27 is
a copy of a letter of May 15, 1925 from Ran-

 

dolph to President Calvin Coolidge about the
Confederate Memorial half dollar. The U. S.
Congress passed the Confederate Memorial Coinage
Act which authorized the minting of 5,000,000

 
7

half dollars (sometimes called Stone Mountain
half dollars) to be sold at a profit for the
benefit of the Confederate memorials.

The sculptor's wife, Mrs. Mary (Montgomery )
Borglum, in an undated leaflet defends her
husband against some of the charges hurled at
him, and attacks the S. M. C. M. A.*S executive

 

committee. She sides with various persons,
including the Rev. Dr. Plato Tracy Durham (1873-
1930).

Two undated items are by an Atlanta lawyer,

Reuben &. Arnold, who served as the Association®
Gen. Counsel. One is a brief on Ga. Senate

Bill No. 3 to confer the right of eminent

domain upon the S. M. S. M. A., lest the propert
revert to the Atlanta Chapter, U. D. C., in
April, 1928. The other is an argument over the
Association and the Stone Mountain property.

There is a poem," Record the Confederates

presumably the author.

Confederated Southern Memorial Association, com-
plaining that the "Atlanta Chapter" of the U. D.

There is an undated open letter to the
United Sons of Confederate Veterans and

others on the Executive Committee of the
S. M. C. M. Ae, and Randolph's secretaries.

Henry Storm was apparently much interested in
the history of Va. and in her public men. Two of
the letters ask for information regarding the
Careers of John Snyder Carlile and Joseph John-

 

 

son who had both been governors of and congress-
men from that State. The other letter reveals
Storm as an autograph seeker. The two letters
contain bio Oe information of some value

respecting Carlile and Johnson.

Boston, Mass, 40 items, Sketch

James Jackson Storrow was a lawyer in Bos-
ton, Mass. His papers include letters and lega
documents of individual clients, correspondence
on several corporation cases, and letters in
reference to a Federal bill for the revision

 

of patent laws in which he played a large part.
Among his clients was Charlotte B. Wise,
whose business matters he handled while she was
abroad. Another was G. N. Kettle, who corre-
sponded from Paris. Storrow appears to have
handled his business investments in the Apple-

 
Storrow 2.
ton Co., Boing Brothers Co., and Lee Higginson
& Co. Kettle makes some interesting comments
upon the growth of American business during
this period. Storrow also advised on personal
and financial matters of Kettle's children
living in America.

 

Other clients are Charles C. Jackson and
O. H. Perry, for whom he executed wills, and
Alice L. Heard, whose bank account he handled.

Several items appear to be personal let-
ters. One from C. ¢. do n Chicago de-
scribes a great firépw otally destroyed

his home and possessions,

There are a number of papers concerning
mortgages. Correspondence from George S. Hale
of Boston refers to mortgages in terms of
Hammond's Compromise. A lengthy letter from
Ashley Pond, apparently a court official in

 

Detroit, Mich., discusses some technical points
of mortgages, and mentions the Michigan Iron
Co. case in relation to it.

A letter from Ball and Owen, attorneys
in Marquette, Mich., contains more about the
Michigan Iron Co. case, reporting that it is

 
Storrow &
soon to go to the Supreme Court.

A Philadelphia court official writes con-
cerning some legal points in the Peabill _-7;
Mountain issue which Storrow was to handle.

One of Storrow's primary interests lay in
patent law. A group of letters from government

 

offices in Washington, D. C., indicate his role
in a bill for the revision of the patent laws.
That he was recognized es an authority on
the subject is evident in a letter from John E.
Hatch, a Cincinnati lawyer, who writes of re-
ferring the Hall Safe ry Co., in a patent

Story, George. Papers. London, England

 

George Story (1738-1818) was a Methodist
itinerant preacher. He was first apprenticed
to a printer and later became foreman of a
printing shop. While engaged in this occupa-
tion, he was converted to Methodism in 1760
and in 1763 entered the ministry. After being

stationed at numerous charges in England, he
was appointed "Corrector of the Press" in 1792,
his title being changed to "Editor" in 1794.

He remained with the Methodist Publishing

 
Story, George 2
House until 1807,

Professor Frank Baker, a Wesley scholar and
a member of the faculty of the Duke University
Divinity School, has provided a short biographi-
cal sketch of Story and information on the
printed and manuscript material acquired from
Story's descendants. He identified each item

 

by number and although his system did not
record the items in chronological order, it

has been retained in cataloging the manuscripts
in the collection. A copy of Dr. Baker's

 
story, George ie

summary has been placed in the Inventory File.
The correspondence in the collection consists

of two letters and a fragment of another from

John Wesley to Story and one from Thomas Coke

to Wesley. Wesley's letters contain advice

concerning Story's ministry, while Coke's is

an account of an incident which occurred during

 

a preaching mission. at Newport on the Isle of
Wight.

A broadside dated December 10, 1792, concerns
Story's policy as’ the new editor of the

 
Story, George 4
Methodist Publishing House, The original print-
ed copy of this item has been placed in the
Broadside Collection in the Rare Book Depart-
ment; a Xerox copy can be found with the
papers.

The volumes are a part of the numerous note-
books and records kept by Story. They in-

 

clude sermon outlines, notes on medical reme-
dies, and other miscellaneous entries. Two of
the outlines-are of sermons preached by John
Wesley (found in Volumes 9 and 11). Like

 
Story, George é.)
Wesley and other early Methodist ministers,
Story provided medical care for many of his
parishoners. Many of the volumes contain pre-
scriptions and other information related to the
treatment of various maladies. Volume 13 in-
cludes notes taken on medical lectures and may
indicate that he attended these lectures during

 

his ministry in Edinburgh in 1772 and 1773.
Volume 20 is an index to the volumes of medical
memoranda, some of which have not survived.

The volumes numbered 5, 6, and 7 contain

 
Story, George

membership lists for several of the charges
served by Story, including the Dales, Sarun,

and Macclesfield circuits. Volume 21 is a book
of hymns largely written in one of the shorthand
systems used by Story in many of his writings.
The last volume, Number 22, is an adaptation of
Samuel Taylor's shorthand instructions.

Taylor's and Aulay Macaulay's were the two
systems followed by Story.

STOUT, Leonidas. Papers, 1857-1928. New Albany,
Floyd Co., Ind, 235 items. Sketch,

From this collection one may learn only a lit-
tle about Leonidas Stout. A lawyer at New Al-
bany, Indiana, he gave up his legal practice to
fight for the Union, eventually rising to the
rank of lieutenant colonel in the 13th Indiana

 

Cavalry Volunteers, He returned to his law office
after the war and was active in helping Northern
veterans secure pensions from the Federal Govern-
ment, Many papers relating to pension claims

are in this collection, among them letters from
Senator John L, Mitchell of Wisconsin and Repre-

 
STOUT, Leonidas

 

sentative William T. Zenor of Indiana, There are
Union recruiting lists, as well as a broadside
advertising the second reunion of the 13th Indi-
ana Cavalry to be held Sept. 24 and 25, 1989.
Stout became the husband of Dorah Ann Swarens,
August 19, 1849, and they were the parents of

three daughters: Dorah Elizabeth (who married
Charles V. Ellmeker); Hattie L. (who married
Samuel H. Hood); and Florence M. L. (who married
John B. Graves), Genealogical charts and other
information concerning family history are also
found in these papers.

Samuel Hollingsworth Stout (1822-1903), a
graduate of the Medical School of the Universit
of Pennsylvania about 1847, was a contract
surgeon with the C.S.A. Army, at the beginning
of the Civil War with Colonel John Brown's 3rd
Tenn. regiment. He soon became post surgeon
of the hospitals at Chattanoga, Tenn., where
his administrative ability in medical affairs
of the Army and the Department of Tenn. under
Generals Bragg and Polk led to his appointment

as Medical Director of Hospitals for that
command. In later life he continued his pro-
fessional career in Texas, where he helped to
found the medical department of the University
of Dallas. He became dean of that faculty. Dr
Stout also served as secretary of the Confeder-
ate Military and Surgical Association, before
which he delivered an address in 1902 on the
history of his command. This manuscript is at
the conclusion of these papers.

Dr. Stout's records and correspondence are i

two sections; the manuscripts are paralleled by

 
Stout, Samuel Hollingsworth A
nine reels of microfilm. Some details of his
early career are in the films, which are
described hereafter. Both the papers and the
microfilm are for the most part official in
character, with letters and reports from many
medical officers of the Confederate Army.

Dr. Stout, evidently from Giles City, Tenn.,
published a prospectus of The Central Medical
and Surgical Journal, Apr. 20, 1349, in Nash-
ville. His papers contain no other reference
to his personal life. Letters, telegrams, and
reports concern transfers, receipts, etc. during

 

 

 

 
Stout, Samuel Hollingsworth 4
the Civil War.

30 items, transferred from the C.S.A. Archives
5-13-57, are consolidated morning reports,
March 1 - 12, 1865, and Feb. 19, 1865, which
were compiled by Stout as medical director. The
other items included are reports, orders,
telegrams, and lists from Mississippi and

 

Georgia. One document dated 1864 lists all
hospitals of the Army of Tennessee. :

121 items added 9-15-67, are also official
Confederate material. They concern Medical
Directors Andrew J. Foard, Samuel Merrifield

 
Stout, Samuel Hollingsworth be
Bemiss, and Samuel H. Stout, whose work was
interrelated. Many-.other Confederate surgeons
were under the command of these men. As the
Army of Tennessee was slowly pushed back through
days of desperate fighting by the Union Army,
the hospital system was also steadily forced
Southeastward from Tenn. and Mississippi into

 

Alabama and Ga. Battles involved emergency
medical measures, as seen in calls for aid and
establishment of new hospitals. Transport of
wounded, inspections, supplies, relief
associations, nursing, and medical examining

 
Stout, Samuel Hollingsworth 6
boards are all glimpsed amid increasing shortage
of physicians.

Vaccination for smallpox was one of the
details of concern to Confederate surgeons in
Nov., 1862.

Such prominent physicians as Drs. Stanford
Cnaillé, David W. Yandell, Josiah Clark Nott,
Edward A. Flewellen, and Frank Armstrong Jones
all appear in the papers of the Confederate
hospital organization. Dr. Samuel Merrifield
Bemiss became second in command when Dr. Stout
was appointed on May 29, 186@, as medical

 

 
Stout, Samuel Hollingsworth 7
director of hospitals of the Army of Tenn.
Of interest is a directive of Dr. Dudley D.
Saunders to surgeons of Forsyth, Ga., on Aug.
5, 106604, in which he outlines the duties of
hospital physicians.

Reports continue. On Dec. 19, 1864, a map
located the hospital installations in Miss. and

 

Ala. (between Vicksburg and Montgomery )

The war ended with Dr. Foard ordered on Mar.
20, 1865, to report to General Joseph E.
Johnston's command, while Dr. Stout was still
at Columbus, Ga. On Apr. 6, 1865, the hospital

 
stout, Samuel Hollinzsworth e)
corps, with all its property possible to
transport, was ordered to concentrate at
Charlotte, N.C. (The order included specifically
a dentist and a printing press.)

1 item added, 11-14-72: A docketed letter toa
Stout from J. A. Cody, the Post Adjutant at the
Head-Quarters Post in Columbus, Georgia. In the

 

letter, dated September 28, 1864, Cody requests
that Stout investigate the unscrupulous activi-
ties of a conscript, W. H. H. Phelps.

Report (Aug., 1862) from a medical officer sent
by Stout to find suitable quarters for hospitals
at Ringgold, Cherokee Springs, Tunnel Hill, and
Dalton, Ga. A report of Dec.,1862 states that
camp parole at Chattanooga had been managed

badly. A circular of that month outlines the
duties of medical officers. Report (Feb., 1863)
by the inspector of hospitals in the "Tenn.

Dist." describes conditions there. A letter of
Mar., 1863 says that prisoners placed in hospi-

 
Stout, Samuel Hollingsworth ee |
tals are frequently escaping. There are letters
of Mar. 1863 from an officer at Tunnel Hill, Ga.
and from E. A. Flewellen, medical director of
East Tenn. These letters are full of interesting
details, one of them being about food for the
sick. Letters of Jan. and Feb. 1864 mention
“Ladies Hospital" at Montgomery, Ala. and the
destruction by fire of the S. P. Moore Hospital
at Griffin, Ga. Reports from hospitals at Eu-
fala, Ala. and Dawson, Ga. Letters stating

that patients at Marietta, Ga. were being eva-

supplies and a factory to aid the Macon hospital.
A letter sent by flag of truce in June 1864
announces the death of Stout's daughter in Giles
City, Tenn., and that his Negroes have gone.
Report from the medical inspector of the Dis~~*
tricts of Va., Tenn., Ga., July 14, 1864. Let-
ters of Aug. 8 and Oct. 31, 1864, deal with the
difficulty over whether state militia surgeons
of Ga. come under the authority of the C. S. A.
medical officers.

In the latter part of 1864 the hospitals in

 

 
Stout, Samuel Hollingsworth 5
Eufala and Auburn, Ala. and Geneva, Ga. were
closing. By Nov. Stout had retreated with the
army to Tuscumbia, Ala. In Dec. he was at Ma~
con, and by the first of Feb., 1865, he had
reached Columbus, Ga. Three letters from D. C.
Saunders of Auburn, Ala. are filled with inter-
esting comments on conditions in that section,

 

the retreat before the advancing army, and the
fall of Montgomery.

into his possession as organizer and medical
director of the Hospital Dept. of the Cc. S.A.
Army in Tenn., Miss., Ga., Ala., and La. He
intended to write a full’ history of that depart-

Stowe Family. Papers. Stowesville,
Gaston Co., N.C,

 

The Stowes were a prominent family in Gaston
County. Larkin Stowe (d.1857) was a legislator
and councillor of state. Either he or his sons
founded Stowe's Factory on the South Fork of
the Catawba River two or three miles below what

is now Cramerton. The date of the completed
factory is given as 1853, and it was thought to
be the third textile mill constructed in the
county. Larkin Stowe's sons were Jasper,
William A., and E. B. Stowe (Edwin B. according

 
Stowe Family

to an-inscription in one of the volumes, but
given as Edward in a county history). Infor-
mation about the Stowes and their factory can
be found in: Robert F. Cope and Manly Wade
Wellman, The County of Gaston; and in Gastonia
and Gaston County North Carolina 1846-

J. & E. B. Stowe was a mercantile store at

 

 

 

Stowesville before the Civil War; see The
Southern Business Directory (Charleston, 1854),
p. 384, Their factory and large farm appear in

editions of Branson's North Carolina Busines
Directory.after the Civil War. The map inside

 

 
Stowe Family

the front cover of Cope and Wellman"s book
locates the factory and Larkin Stowe's residence
It is unclear at a given point in time which
Stowes owned the businesses, so the volumes are
labeled for the Stowe Family.

The Account Book, 1856-1874, contains a vari-
ety of records. It is labeled on the cover as
"Cash Book for J. & E. B. Stowe Charlotte". The
first part of the volume contains a cashbook
for March, 1856, to August, 1858. At the back
of the volume there are records entitled "Cash

 

 
Stowe Family 4
Sales of J. & E. B. Stowe Charlotte” in which
figures were recorded daily but the commodities
were not specified. The cashbook records a
variety of transactions which are specified.
There are many entries for the factory. Trans-
actions for corn, flour, and cotton are numerous
It appears that these records are for both fac-
tory and non-factory business.

Other parts of this volume are still more
valuable and interesting. Following the cash-
book and mercantile account with Tom Stowe,
1865-1872, there are eight pages of discussion

 

 
Stowe Family 5
on the management of textile factories and esti-
mates for the operation of mills that could
produce 1,000 and 2,000 pounds of 4/4 sheetings
per day. The writer was especially concerned
with the potential of farmers for factory manage-
ment and with their prejudice against cooperation
in that and other ventures. This text is undated

 

and unsigned, and it is not clear whether it is
an original or copied from elsewhere. The hand-
writing differs from the later factory estimates.
These later estimates are very lengthy (42 pp)
detailed, and varied. The dates that appear are

 
Stowe Family 6
1874. Sometime between 1872 and 1877/78, ac-
cording to those editions of Branson's Directory,
the ownership of the factory passed from the
Stowe's to A, R, Homesley. These estimates may
relate in some way to the changes at that time.
The estimates concern such matters as: a
water-powered mill and a factory producing 1,000
pounds of sheetings daily; Stowesville Factorv
as it now is; estimates for a factory capital-
ized at $60,000 and for one at $30,000 producing
500 pounds daily; Stowesville sectety as now
operated (500 lbs.) and as it could be altered;

Stowe Family 10
accounts tor Larkin Stowe and other Stowes.
There is still some mystery since the manufac-
turing schedule of the federal census of 1850
does not list any textile mills in Gaston County,
and most workers could not be located in the
population schedule (John and Enos B, Glenn
being exceptions). According to county histo-

 

ries by Cope and by Separk, the Stowe's factory
was not operating until 1853. Robert A, Ragan
concurred in their judgment in his "The

Pioneer Cotton Mills in Gaston County, N.C."
(1961). His work includes a clipping about

 
Stowe Family 11
the disagreements over the dates and chronology
of the first cotton mills. Mrs. Minnie Stowe
Puett declared in her history that the Stowe
factory began in 1848, and this ledger supports
her statement.

The ledger mixes various business operations
of the Stowes including the factory and store.
According to an entry on page 69 ot oe also had
a mill. There are extensive accounts for work-
ers in which there are many entries for wages
and board. Reference to "Hands Day Book" and

"Hands Book" evidence the use of a special

factory and work upon it can be found, There
are accounts for a number of free blacks, both

that slaves may have been employed, as in
John McCartha's account (p. 63) where a nota-
tion reads "by 96 days work (Boys)." It is
unclear whether such references mean children
or slaves.

London, England

Lieutenant General Sir Richard Strachey
(1817-1908) of the Royal Bengal Engineers had
a long and distinguished career in the Indian
service that is described in the Dictionary of
National Biography (Vol. 33) and in Who Was
Who, 1897-1916.

 

 

 

 

A dozen letters of 1871-1875 are addressed
to Strachey and to close relatives by Napoldon
La Cécilia (1835-1878), a general of the French
Commune. La Cécilia was a professor of mathe-
matics before he served with Garibaldi in Italy

 
Strachey, Sir Richard 2

 

in 1860. He later taught at the University of
Ulm before returning to France where he became
active in leftist politics. He served in the
army during the Franco-Prussian War and then
joined the Paris Commune of 1871 in whose ser-
vice he became a general. When the Commune
fell, he fled to England.

In the earliest letter (Sept. 27, 1871), La
Césilia appealed to Lady Strachey for help in
finding a professorial position.

On Jan. 21 and 23, 1874, he asked Lady

Elinor Colvile, the sister of Lady Strachey,

 
Strachey, Sir Richard 4

 

for the return of a book by Charles Bernard
Renouvier, a philosopher about whom he wanted
to write an essay. Meanwhile he was trans-
lating an unidentified work from Russian.

A series of letters during Oct.-Dec., 1874,
concerns La Cécilia's interest in a project for
training and equipping the army of Yakub Beg

(also called Atalik Ghazi), a leader of Kashgar
in Chinese Turkestan who had successfully
rebelled against Peking in 1864. His regime
endured until shortly after his death in 1877

when the Chinese restored their authority. Both

 
Strachey, Sir Richard 4
the Russians and English were interested in

the region to which they had sent exploring
expeditions. The military project was outlined
in letters of Oct. 19 and Dec. 15, 1874, by its
author, General Gustave Paul Cluseret (1823-
1900), a French military officer and politician
who had also held high office during the
Commune. English approval of the plan was
sought through Strachey and others. Cluseret
stated that the idea originated with Major
Herbert Wood of the Royal Engineers and that

James Anthony Froude, Col. McKaye and William

 

 
Strachey, Sir Richard a
Forsyth had been helpful. (Oct. 19).

Several other letters by La Cécilia are
personal communications.

On May 5, 1905, an unidentified person,
apparently an Indian railway official, wrote to
Sir Richard Strachey, Chairman of the East
Indian and Assam, Bengal railways. He commented

 

on his participation in the International
Railway Congress at Washington, D.C. and
criticized the anti-English tone of the opening
address by Stuyvesant Fish, President of the

Congress and of the American Railway Associatio

 
Strachey, Sir Richard ; 6
The writer also noted the circumstances of the
selection of Frederick Palmer as a delegate by
the East Indian Railway. Palmer, formerly an
engineer for the railway, was chief engineer

U. S. Army at the beginning of the Civil War.
After leaving the Army, he was appointed adju-

tant general of New Jersey and served continu-
ously in that office until his death. He was
active in the New Jersey Historical Society
and was elected its president in 1897. A

In the address, Stryker reminisced about the
Battle of Morris Island, S. C., which took
place in July, 1863, and about a meeting he

had with Abraham Lincoln in Washington a short
while after the battle. Further comments by
him about this military engagement can be

Chiefly personal and business letters and
C. S. Army orders by C. S. Gen. James Ewell
Brown Stuart (1833-1864). Most of these papers
were written from various Confederate Army Head-
quarters in the Army of Northern Virginia.
Stuart's first letter, dated June 10, 1861,

is to a former V. M. I. staff member, C. S. Col.
James Walkinshaw Allen, Commander of the 2nd

Regt. of Va. Inf. Stuart sends Allen two Negro
boy slaves belonging to a brother of Gen. Robert
E. Lee, Capt. Sidney Smith Lee, of the Va. Navy,

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown (2)
and later of the C. S. Navy. The slaves were
sent to Harper's Ferry, to the care of Allen, at
the request of Mrs, Anne Marie (Mason) Lee, who
wishes the colonel to hire them to some C, S.
Army officers who need slaves, such as Gen.
Joseph E. Johnston and Capt. (later Gen.) Edwin

 

Gray Lee. Stuart also tells about a minor en-
gagement in which a small detachment of his
troops had killed several of the enemy.

Stuart writes to his wife, the former Miss
Flora Cooke, on June 13 about the approaching
crisis, which turned out to be the First Battle

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown (3)

 

of Manassas on July 21. He is in daily communi-
cation with Gen. Joseph &, Johnston,

Stuart has a note appended to a list of
prisoners of the 30th Regt. of N. Y. Inf. Vols.
captured in an engagement on Nov. 16 at Doolan's
Parm, Va.

On the 20th Stuart writes to Gen. P. G, T,

Beauregard about the abusive language of one
Alfred Moss. He mentions Gen. James Longstreet.
Stuart, as commander of the 2nd Brig. of
Cav., issues Gen Order No. 5 on Dec. 3, commend-
ing the following commanders and their respec-

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown (4)
tive commands for recent successful action:

Col. William Edmonson ("Grumble") Jones, lst
Regt. of Va. Cav., capture of Federal prisoners;

Major William Thompson Martin, Jefferson
Davis Legion (originally 2nd Bn. of Miss. Cav.),
capture of Federal prisoners on Nov. 16 at Dool-
an's Farm, where a Union Army foraging party was
disrupted;

Lt. Col. Fitzhugh Lee, a detachment of the
lst Regt. of Va. Cav., rout of the enemy in a

skirmish;

 

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown (5)

 

Col. Robert Ransom, Jr., lst Regt. of N. C,
Cav., provisional army (also known as the 9th
Regt. of N. C. Vol. Cav.), rout of a U. S. Army
column, infliction of casualties upon the enemy,
and capture of Federal prisoners and supplies;
and

Col. Charles William Field, 6th Regt. of Va.
Cav., killing of enemy pickets and capture of
Federal prisoners and supplies.

Jones, Martin, Lee, Ransom, and Field later
became C,. S. generals. Still later Lee became

a U. S. general.

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown (6)

 

Two letters of Gen. Stuart to Martin, dated
Dec. 3, 1861, and Mar. 3, 1862, deal, respective
ly, with details of orders to secure information
on enemy movements and to remove camp to Madison
Co., Va.

Stuart writes to Gen. Joseph E. Johnson on

Mar. 12, 1862, giving intelligence information
about U. S. Army activities in and around Manas-
sas, Centreville, and Groveton, Va. He mentions
several Confederate prisoners from the La. Tigrs
(Wheat's Bn. of La. Inf.) and information obtain
ed by two white Southerners and a Negro woman
slave.

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown

 

A newspaper clipping contains an obituary of
the general's daughter, Flora, who died on Nov.3
He writes about that death to Lily Lee on the
16th, stating that his wife has not been herself
since the 3rd. He was sending the letter by
Major John Pelham, who was going to the Valley

on an inspection tour. On Dec. 5 the general
writes againto Lily Lee, discussing the death

of Capt. Redmond Burke and enclosing his Div. of
Cav.'s Order No. 14 of Dec. 3 upon that subject.
In his letter Stuart goes om to mention his wif
personal affairs, and other matters. A lady in

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown

 

Baltimore had sent him an elegant pair of gold
spurs. He is chargrined at the idea of the
Yankees opening letters to him. He trusts that
the Confederacy will very soon have a glorious
victory (and it came at Fredericksburg on the
13th). Mrs. Stuart has made him a beautiful

cape.

On the 18th Gen. Stuart writes to a son of
Gen. Robert E, Lee, Col. George Washington
Custis Lee, an aide-de-camp on the staff of
Jefferson Davis. Stuart is concerned here with

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown (9)

 

 

a William Thomas Magruder, who resigned as cap-
tain in the U. S. Army on Oct. 1, 1862, and be-
came captain in the C. S, Army. (See F. B.
Heitman, Historical Register and Dictionary of
the U. S. Army, Vol. I, p. 684.) Under a flag
of truce on Dec. 18 Stuart had seen U. S. Gen,

Joseph Taylor, grandson of President Zachary
Taylor and Chief-of-Staff of U. 5S. Gen. Edwin
Vose Sumner, Sr. Taylor told Stuart that Ma-
gruder went to U. S. President Abraham Lincoln
to obtain an appointment as brigadier general

in the U. S. Army and $ along recommendations

 
Stuart, James Ewell .Brown (

and letters vouching for his loyalty to the

U. S., but, failing to be promoted, he resigned
from the U. S, Army and came South, Furthermore
a cavalryman captured by Stuart in the summer of
1862 had told him that Magruder had just gone
on then to try to be appointed brigadier genera
Taylor thinks that Magruder ought to be kicked
out of the Confederacy. Stuart thinks that
Magruder's commission should be revoked and
urges Lee to lay the matter before President
Davis. Stuart goes on to discuss the Battle of
Fredericksburg, fought on the 13th. Englishmen

 

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown
there who had surveyed Solferino and all the
battlefields of Italy say that the pile of dead
on the plains of Fredericksburg exceeds anything
of the sort ever seen by them.

An undated memorandum by Stuart accompanies
a letter by him of Feb. 22, 1863, to Lt. Col.
(later Gen.) William Henry Fitzhugh Payne, of
the 4th Regt. of Va. Cav. Both items discuss
plans to establish near Richmond a camp for
paroled Confederate cavalry prisoners. Stuart

regrets that Payne's wound will deprive the
C. S. A. of his valuable services in the field,

 

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown (12)

 

but believes that his command of the proposed
camp will be highly beneficial to the cavalry
arm.

Payne replies on the 28th to Stuart that he
is ready and willing for field duty and that he
has written to Gen. Arnold Elzey (originally
Arnold Elzey Jones).

Stuart writes on Mar. 1 to Messrs. West and
John, ichmond publishers, about various books
published by them, including Jomini's Practice
of War, Napolean's Maxims of War, and McQueen's
book on the laws of war.The Army and the country

 
Stuart, James Ewell Brown
rindebted to West and Johnson, affirms Stuart.
He attaches a list of books to the letter.

Stuart mentions Gen. Earl Van Dorn on April 6
1863, in a letter to an unnamed colonel.

Stuart writes another letter on the same date
to Payne asking him to thank some ladies for
some gloves and praising Virginia's fair women
and brave men.

Stuart writes again to Payne on May 4 about
the Battle of Chancellorsville, in which he
commanded Jackson's Corps (later called Stuart's
Corps.). Gen.Fitzhugh Lee was ordered to re-

letters which John L. Stuart wrote home from
various camps. These letters give a good picture
of the live of the average common soldier of the
Confederacy. They tell of camp life, of marches,
of engagements, of food and clothes, of the opti-
mism of the army, yet reflecting clearly the wea~-
riness of the war which existed even in the midst
of that optimism. Stuart served around Richmond

and Petersburg in both the earlier and later en-

gagements, as well as at Drewry'sBluff, and in
eastern North Carolina, The lettérs are full of
incidents such as that one told in the letter of
July 22, 1863, of the Negro woman who brought
what she called "pig stew" into camp to sell; it
was found to be dog meat and the woman was flog-
ged 39 times in the middle of the camp. The set

and comments it contains on deserters and con-
scripts in hiding, especially in Moore County.
Three letters partic rly good on this subject
are those of Jan. 12, Feb. 20, and March 22, 1863
these being letters from John Harper to John
Stuart, for it is Harper's letters that are most
valuable in this connection, Stuart does mention

 

deserters occasionally, however, as in his letter
of Feb. 5, 1864, in which he speaks of deserters
fighting with the "Yankees" Another thing this

and military leadership, for he tells that "the
general" had commanded his group to attack the
tawn of Newbern, N. C., but that his Colonel had
remanded the orders, thinking the venture futile,
In another letter he speaks of boxes of supplies
being left in care of a lieutenant, only to have
boxes and lieutenant disappear. Especially on
the subject of desertion, this collection and the
Bryan Tyson Collection in this library will be
found mutually supplementary.

John L. Stuart left the service after the War,

in North Carolina, notably in Montgomery County.
Several of his school attendance records are in-

He also served as agent for the Star Line of
New York Packets. He is listed in Burke and
Boinest's Charleston Directory, 1866 in which

 

he also has an advertisement. Apparently he

ume. All accounts are Daybook entries except

 

for those on pp. 340-343, a special account
entitled "Messrs. Gibbons in a/c with D.J.

John W. Sturtevant was born in Keene, N. H.,
in 1840. He enlisted in the 14th N. H. Infan-
try Volunteers in August, 1862 and served until
he was mustered out, with the rank of captain
in July, 1865. His regiment was sent to Wash-

ington in Oct., 1862, to help defend the capita
For nine months (April, 1863 -- Jan., 1864) the
regiment was garrisoned in Washington. From

May to Nov., 1863, Sturtevant was in command of

 
Sturtevant, John W. 2
a detail stationed at the 6th Street Wharf; its
duties were to guard large quantities of quar-
termaster's supplies and to examine the passes
and baggage of any person traveling to or from
the Army of the Potomac. On March, 1864, the
regiment was sent to New Orleans for duty in the
Mississippi Valley. In July it returned to

 

Virginia and fought in the Battle of Opequon
(Sept. 19, 1864), where Sturtevant was twice
wounded. The regiment went to Savannah in Jan.,
1865 and remained there as part of the occupa-

 
Sturtevant, John W. 3

 

tion forces, After the war, Sturtevant returned
to Keene, where he died in 1892. Some biogra-
phical information on him is in F. H. Buffun,
A Memorial of the Great Rebellion: Being a
History of The Fourteenth Regiment, New Hamp-
shire Volunteers (Boston, 1882).

This collection consists of five letters

 

 

 

 

from Sturtevant to his parents. Four were writ-
ten when he was in command of the detail at the
6th Street Wharf. They are largely personal in
nature and tell very little about Sturtevant's

 
Sturtevant, John W, 4
work or about garrison duty in war-time Washing-
ton. Sturtevant managed to get a clerkship for
his brother, Horatio, in the Ordnance Depart-
ment, and part of one letter (Oct. 24, 1864)

was written by the latter. The last letter
(March 18, 1864) is from New York City, where
Sturtevant's regiment is preparing to sail for
New Orleans. He tells about the St. Patrick's
Day celebration he saw in New York.

Samuel Styre served in Company K of the 42nd
Regiment of Ohio Volunteers from the summer of
1862 until the end of the Civil War. Late in
1864, his regiment was disbanded, and he was
placed in Company E of the 96th Regiment of
Ohio Volunteers. He was stationed mainly at
various places along the Mississippi River, and
several of his letters describe the Battle of
Vicksburg and skirmishes in Mississippi, Lousi-
ana, and Alabama. He also comments on foraging
missions in which Southern property was

confiscated or destroyed, the Presidential elec-
tion of 1864, Nathaniel Prentice Banks, and
"copperheads" in Ohio and other areas in the
Union states,

Two letters from Joseph Bradfield are also
filed with Styre's papers, They refer generally
to the activities of the 45th Ohio Regiment.

Sketch,

Mainly business letters and papers of ©’...
George Suckley, Sr.,shipowner and merchant of
New York, and his sons, Thomas H. Suckley,
John H. Suckley (@ 1865), George Suckley, Jr.,

 

M. D. (a. 1869), and Rutsen Suckley. Suckley
was in the U. S. in the 1790's, probably as
an agent for Artz and Company of Sheffield,
Eng. Around 1800 he became the partner of
Thomas Holy of Sheffield, and came to America
probably as the ~é factor for the mer-

 
uckley, George 2. and Jr _2
cantile f of Holy and Suckley. Apparently
he settledpermanently in N. Y. At any rate,
his children lived there, and George Suckley,Jr
was born there.

The bulk of the collection falls between
1846 and 1859%. The most interesting letters

 

are from T. H. Suckley to his relatives” in
1848. Combining business and pleasure in his
European tour, he visits Tireste, Venice, Rome,
Naples, FlorenGe, Marseilles, Geneva, Rotter-
dam, London, Edinburgh, and Liverpool, in that
order, and gives on \ descriptions of

 
Suckley, George, Sr. and Jr. 3

scenery, customs, and local politics. While
his reports on the Revolution are skimpy, he
does mention Louis-Philippe's abdication (Feb.
29), fighting in Italy (May 17), and a great
commotion in Marseilles (July 2). In his, as
in some other papers, are references to Baring

 

Brothers and Company of London.

In the 1850's a number: of. papers deal with
the overseas trade of M. M, Freeman and Company,
of which George Suckley, Jr. is a partner.
There are several bills of sale for registered
vessels (1855-1857), , of service

 
Suckley, George, Sr. and Jr. 4
and equipment in preparing each ship for travel

(1855-1859).

George Suckley, Jr. was Asst. Surg., U. S.
Army, 1853-1856; and Surg., U. 8S. Army Vols.,
1861-1865. He rose to the brevet rank of Gol.
AU. S. Army receipt of 1856 contains a list of

 

medicines, medical books, etc.

Dr. Suckley corresponded in 1860 with James
Graham Cooper, M. D., naturalist of the
Smithsonian Institution, about the publication

problems of their book, The Natural History of

Washington Territo : (New York and London,
1859)

 
Suckley George, St. and Jr. ie
Suckley alone wrote On the North American Spe-
oh ae Salmon and Trout (Washington. D. C.,
1874).

Dr. Benjamin Tappan writes to Ir. Suckley
in 1862 about U. S. Army médical personnel,
criticizing Dr. W. A. Hammond (Surg.-Gen.) and

A graduate of Harvard University in 1790, he
also studied law and was admitted to the New
Hampshire bar. His political career included

terms in the New Hampshire legislature and the
U.S. House of Representatives. He was a
Federalist. During 1805 to 1806 and 1816 to

1835, Sullivan served as Attorney General of

New Hampshire. Also, he represented his state
in the Dartmouth College Case.

The item is a letter Sullivan wrote to a
Mr. Aspenwall on Jan. 9, 1837. Sullivan
referred to a political pamphlet he wrote
which gave his views on a better system and
requested Aspenwall's new address.

This collection is comprised of two auto-
graph albums of Jane W. (Brooks) Sullivan and
Janie C. Sullivan. The first volume covers
the years 1835 to 1846 and the second one runs

from 1861 to 1864. In the first album, on

Aug. 3, 1835, G. W. Sullivan, who is identified
by a later hand as Jane's grandfather but was,
presumably, her husband's grandfather, wrote

a poem ending with the idea that woman has a

 
Sullivan Family 2

 

happy influence on man. On the following day
he wrote a more philosophical poem and also
quoted one by William Cowper on conversation.
Some of those who signed their poems only with
initials have been further identified in the
album. The first entry, but one of the latest,

in the album is a poem written to Mrs. Sullivan
on the death of her son James. It was signed
G. K. The third to the last poem in the vol-
ume is entitled "Woman." It was written at
Laurensville, another name for Laurens, in 1835

 
Sullivan Family

by R. C., and it gives an idealized view of

nineteenth-century woman. The last entry is

"An Ode to the Friendship Temperance Society."
The second album contains entries by some

of Janie C. Sullivan's teachers and school-

mates at the Masonic Female College at Cokes-

 

bury, S.C.

These volumes contain, in the main, the
usual type of sentimental verse and other
messages that appear in autograph albums. Amid
the poems and other expressions of sentiments

of friendship, one friend referred in his

statement to the Civil War as the second revo-

Summer, David. Papers, 1874-1892. Leitersburg,
Washington County, Maryland.

 

This collection consists almost entirely of
letters written to David Summer, apparently
a school teacher of Leitersburg, Maryland, by
his son John L. Summer of Logan County, Ohio.
In ca. 1876 John L. Summer had gone to Logan

County, Ohio, where he taught school in the
communities of Bellefontaine, Bloom Center,
Zimmermanville, Greta, and De Graff. Fora
short time he manufactured tiles and then
turned to farming. In 1889 he became a mer-

 
Summer, David 2
chant in De Graff. He married Laura Moot
in 1881.

The letters which John L. Summer wrote to
his parents are devoted almost entirely to
family matters. He did, however, discuss his
teaching, his business activities, and his
work in the Methodist Church. In only a few
of the letters did he comment on important
political questions, and then only in a very
general way. Ina letter from Bellefontaine,
dated November 8, 1876, he mentioned the
excitement and uncertainty surrounding the

 

 
Summer, David si 3
Hayes-Tilden election. On September 29, 1577,
he wrote that many Democrats seemed pleased
with Hayes* policies while many Republicans
were displeased. A letter of December 10,1889,
mentioned William McKinley and John Sherman
and spoke of the death of Jefferson Davis and
the hatred still felt by many Republicans for
the former Confederate President.

Sumner, Charles. Papers. Boston, Suffolk Co.,
Mass,

 

Letters of Charles Sumner comprise nearly all
of this collection. A sizable percentage of
them either do not name the adressee or give
only his or her surname. The correspondence
reflects Sumner's legal, intellectual, politi-

cal, and aesthetic interests as well as comment
on his health after he was assaulted in 1856 by
Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina.
The manuscripts of his writings include a

 
Sumner, Charles 2

 

portion of a speech he gave sometime in 1857 to
the Bencher's dinner in London, and undated
addresses about the value of time and prison
reform. In the latter address he recommended
that the new jail to be built in Boston be
called a house of detention and have individual

cells for the prisoners. The candidacy of

Abraham Lincoln in 1860 which Sumner supported
is discussed in newspaper clippings. The three
lithographs of Sumner feature him in the prime

of life.

 
Sumner, Charles

 

Among the persons of prominence who were
recipients of letters in this collection are:
James Bell, Cephas Brainerd, Horace Greeley,
Henry Dilworth Gilpin, Edward Everett Hale,
Nathan Hale, Nathaniel Niles, the Earl of
Clarendon, and Robert Charles Winthrop.

Included in the correspondence is Sumner's

letter addressed to the public in 1846 in which
he announces that he has no desire for public
office and that his tastes are "alien to offi-
cial life." Over half of the letters fall

 
Sumner, Charles 4
after he was elected to the United States
Senate in 1851 by a coalition of the Democratic
and Free-Soil parties.

The state of Sumner's health after he was
caned by Brooks is described in a letter written
on June 10, 1856, by his brother twenty-one days
after the assault and in several of Charles

 

Sumner's letters. His brother says that Senator
Andrew Pickens Butler of South Carolina, whom
Sumner had criticized in his "Crime Against
Kansas" speech and which criticism brought on

 
Sumner, Charles 5
the caning by Butler's nephew Brooks, had for
four years previously made abusive, personal
attacks upon his brother.

Among the major topics covered in this col-
lection in addition to Sumner's health are: his
upholding the United States Constitution and the
law in relation to the admission of Kansas as a

 

state and in support of the Union during the
Civil War, his struggle against slavery and for
the civil rights of blacks after the war, his
opposition to President Grant's attempt to annex

 
Sumner, Charles 6
the Dominican Republic in 1869, his strong
support of Horace Greeley and oppostion to Grant
during the presidential campaign of 1872, his
concern about Maximilian as emperor of Mexico,
and his desire for a reform of the naturali-
zation and prison systems.

The four letters addressed to Senator Charles
Sumner are from John A. Andrew, Governor of
Mass., Amos Peary, U.S. Consul at Tunis, Edwin
M. Stanton, and William H. Seward. Peary's
letter is the most significant of the lot.

Andrew asks Sumner to send him Congressional
documents as soon as they are printed. The
letters of Stanton and Seward accompanied a
report and letter, respectively, that aremissing

 
Sumner, Charles
from this collection.

Amos Peary wrote regarding the letter General
Heussein had written to Sumner about Tunisian
slavery and the desire of the Bey of Tunisia to
send an envoy, perhaps General Heussein, to con-
gratulate President Lincoln upon the Union victo

 

ry and the abolition of slavery. He said the
Bey desires that his envoy be received without
Turkish mediation as his envoys had been re-
ceived in most of the European capitals. The
desire had also been expressed that Peary

 
Sumner, Charles 3

 

accompany the envoy to the U.S..which would mean
his absence from Tunis for about three months.
He mentions several people who would be capable
of looking after the interests of the U.S. in
Tunisia during his absence. Obviously a strong
opponent of slavery, he wrote that "Our war for

freedom and order has made our country known
and respected." He added that "The Bey desires
not only to compliment our government, but to
learn some lessons for his own guidance."

The letters contain little material of
intrinsic value. They deal mainly with
personal matters, but there are too feww to
give a connected idea of events of Sutherland's

William T. Sutherlin was a prominent business-
man of Danville, Va. His chief business seems to
have been in tobacco with Peter W. Ferrell as his
partner. He was prominent in other respects, being

chairman of the commissioners of the Piedmont
Railroad company in 1862 and sometime before 1871
president of the Va. Agriculture Society. He joined
the Confederate army, became a major, and served as
quartermaster stationed at Danville throughout

the war.

 
Sutherlin, William T. Sketch (2)

 

He seems to have been a commission merchant
somewhat inclined to speculation. His brother, J.M.
Sutherlin who moved to Montgomery, Ala., in 1862
was an inveterate speculator and often interested
William T. Sutherlin in his schemes.

These papers are interesting for their revelation
of business activity during the Confederate

period. They throw some light on real estate in-
terests, railroad building, and tobacco, wheat and
cotton business. There are also several letters

from Bird L. Ferrell, a tobacco farmer near Danville,
Va., to his son P. W. Ferrell, giving descriptions

of labor problems during the war and immediately
after. :

Sutherlin's home was the "last capitol" of
the Confederacy since President Davis stayed there
during his flight southward.
