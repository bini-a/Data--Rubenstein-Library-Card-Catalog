Charles Crossfield Ware, clergyman and au-
thor, was born in Rowland, Kentucky, in 1886.
He graduated from the Kentucky University (Tran
sylvania) College of the Bible and received the
Litt. D. degree from Atlantic Christian College

in 1954. He married Ida Lee Bealle, and they
had three children. His early work included
pastorates in Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana,
North Carolina, and South Carolina. From 1915

 
Ware, Charles Crossfield

to 19572, he was the Executive Secretary of
Missions for the North Carolina Disciples of
Christ. He served as Director of Camp Caroline
in 1953 and 1954, Since retirement he has con-
tinued to serve as Curator of the Carolina Dis-
cipliana Library, a job he assumed in 1924. He
also has been an editor of religious periodi-
cals and has written some books. For further
biographical information, see William S.
Powell's North Carolina Lives (1962) and Who's

 

 

 
Ware, Charles Crossfield
Who in North Carolina (1947).
The volume is a typescript entitled,

"Concerning New River Church now Union Chapel
Christian Church." This church was succes-
sively called St. John's Parish, New River,
Chapel Run, Richlands Chapel, and Union Chapel.
It was at first Church of England, then Baptist

 

 

of various types, and finally Disciples of
Christ.

The volume includes compilations of notes
on Union Chapel and its predecessors; excerpts

 
Ware, Charles Crossfield 4
from minutes, 1794-1881, for the Neuse, Cape
Fear, Goshen, Union, and Eastern associations;
miscellaneous lists, including a list of
ministers; and a brief paragraph on each of

the earliest Christian churches (before 1900)
in Onslow County.

Colonel Josiah Ware to whom these
letters were written lived in Jefferson
county, Va. and was famous in the South
as a breeder of Cotswold sheep. He imported s

 

sheep of the Cotswold strain from England

and constantly strove to improve the

breed in this country. In 1848 Colonel Ware's
sheep tookn first premiums at the fair of

the Maryland Agricultural Society.

The three letters in this collection
are to Colonel Ware in regard to the
purchase of sheep. They apparently have
little value. One letter from William G.
Caperton refers to a letter of Colonel
Ware's which appeared in the Southern
Planter in 1848.

Warfield, Albert Gallatin (d. 1883). Papers.
Oakdale, Howard Co., Maryland

 

Albert Gallatin Warfield, Jr., served in the
C.S.A. lst 'Maryland Cavalry. He became a civil
engineer and worked for the Pittsburgh and
Connellsville Railroad Co. (now part of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) as engineer in 1870

and 1871. In the-early 1870s, he went to Japan
aS a member of the American Scientific Commission
led by General Horace Capron. Capron had served
with the 14th Illinois Cavalry during the Civil

 
Warfield, Albert Gallatin (d. 1883)

 

War. Warfield died in 1883.

An information folder filed with the col-
lection contains a dealer's description of the
collection and material about the Warfield
family in the book, The Founders of Anne Arundel
and Howard Counties, Md. by J. D. Warfield.

The collection is divided into three cate-

 

 

 

gories: correspondence, 1866-1873; printed
material, 1869-1870; and financial papers, n. d.
The correspondence makes up the bulk of the col-
lection. The financial papers include costs of

 
Warfield, Albert Gallatin (d. 1883)
various aspects of the Buffalo Valley Railroad
and the Salisbury Branch of the Pittsburgh and
Connellsville Road. The printed material con-
tains circulars, including illustrations, of
railroad equipment from different railroad
supply companies.

The correspondence in 1866 and 1869 indicates

 

that Warfield was seeking a position with
various railroads. In 1866, he was offered a
position by former Confederate General Isaac
Monroe St. John on the Louisville and Cincinnati

 
Warfield, Albert Gallatin (d. 1883) 4
Railroad. In 1869, he was offered a position

on the Memphis, El Paso and Pacific Railroad by
former Confederate Major in the Virginia Corps
of Engineers, Conway R. Howard. It is not
possible to ascertain from the collection whether
or not he took either of these positions. By
January, 1870, Warfield was addressed as the

 

Assistant Engineer of the Pittsburgh and
Connellsville Railroad Co. Many of the letters
are written to him (1870-1871), while he was the
resident engineer for this railroad company at

 
Warfield, Albert Gallatin (d. 1883)

 

Southampton Mills, Pennsylvania.

The collection contains forty letters to
Warfield from civil engineer Benjamin Henry La-
trobe (October, 1868, to June, 1871) while La-
trobe was Chief Engineer for the Pittsburgh and
Connellsville Railroad Company and Warfield was
his employee. Latrobe's letters reflect his

concerns about his employees, the manner in
which he wanted reports maintained, expenses,
railroad supplies, contractors and a damage
claim brought by a resident near Southampton

 
Warfield, Albert Gallatin (d. 1883) 6
Mills. On June 24, 1871, Latrobe wrote a re-
commendation to General Horace Capron on behalf
of Warfield indicating that he thought Warfield
possessed the qualifications Capron required to
accompany him on his Scientific Commission to
Japan. Warfield did go as a member of the Com-
mission, and the collection contains several

 

items of correspondence written to him while he
was in Japan.

There are five letters from Charles H. Latrobe
(1872-1873), who was with the Baltimore Bridge

 
Warfield, Albert Gallatin (d. 1883)

Company, to Warfield. Charles Latrobe was
Benjamin Latrobe's son and also a civil engineer.
These letters were written to Warfield while he
was in Japan. They urge him to buy material for
railroad bridges from the company, citing ex-
amples and details of successful bridges the
company had already built. Benjamin Latrobe is

 

listed on the letterhead as the company's con-
sulting engineer.

While in Japan, Warfield also received two
letters (1872) from his cousin William H. Martin,

 
Warfield, Albert Gallatin (d. 1883)

 

who was Secretary and General Agent for the
California Immigrant Union. The letters were
written on stationery listing the names of the
Union's Honorary Committee, Board of Trustees
and officers. Martin wrote that as part of his
position he had just brought a colony of Germans
back with him from New York and settled them on

government land inFresno County, California.

He asked Warfield if the Japanese government
would offer any inducements for farmers from the
United States to emigrate to Japan.

 
Warfield, Albert Gallatin (d. 1883)

 

Of particular interest are: the detailed
discussions including costs relating to rail-
road bridges, trestles, locomotives, box cars
and supplies; pen and ink drawings of trestles
by Benjamin Latrobe on a letter (January 18,
1871); two photographs of locomotives made by

the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia
enclosed in a letter (October 13, 1871); and
three photographs of railroad freight cars made
by the Billmeyer and Smalls Company of York,
Pennsylvania enclosed in a letter (October l,

Another interesting aspect of the collection
is that it brings together prominent Union and
Confederate figures in railroad and bridge con-
struction after the Civil War.

Catherine Ann (Ware) Warfield was born in
Natchez, Mississippi, in 1816. She was tutored
in the family home there and later in Philadel-
phia where her father took her and her younger
sister, Eleanor Percy (Ware) Lee, to expose his
daughters to the cultural advantages lacking in
Natchez. She married Robert Elisha Warfield,
the son of a wealthy merchant in Kentucky. She
moved to Kentucky with her husband, eventually

 
Warfield, Catherine Ann (Ware) 2
becoming mistress of their estate near Louis-
ville, “Beechmoor," and remained there until
her death in 1877.

In 1844, Mrs. Warfield and her sister pub-
lished their first book of verse. After another
similar volume, she turned to fiction and wrote
many novels, most of which were published after

 

the Civil War. She remained strongly attached
to her native South, and much of her later
poetry reflects her ties with the Confederacy
during the hostilities. The volume comprising

 
Warfield, Catherine Ann (Ware)
this collection contains poems, some of which

have been published, illustrating her Southern
sympathies.

The James Warren, Jr., MSS. are the family
and personal correspondence of a young marble
worker. In the 1850's there are letters con-
cerning his employment which show that he even-
tually moved to New Haven, Conn.; henceforth he
received letters from his family in Boston and
friends in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The
chief value of the collection lies in the pic-
ture it reveals of everyday life in New England
at the opening of the Civil War among a group

&

 
Warren, James, Jr. rs

 

of average people not concerned about slavery
and evidently not too patriotic after the begin-
ning of the war.

Nov. 4, 1860: Edmund Vannever of Boston
describes the torchlight parades of the Repub-
lican and Union parties in the election of 1860.

May 2, 1861: Lizzie, Mrs. James Warren, Jr.
describes mobilization in Providence, R. I.

June 7, 1861: J. A. C. Hathaway notes the
trade in marble pieces, such as headstones,
table tops, and mantles. He had witnessed the
"funeral obsequies" for Stephen A. Douglas whic

 
Warren, James, Jr.

 

Gov. William Sprague had ordered. Because of
unemployment, men were anxious to enlist and the
2nd R. I. filled as quickly as the lst R. I.
Volunteers.

June 9, 1861: Albert Reynolds notes James
Warren has enlisted for three months. He writes
that Gov. Sprague has become "lion" of the day.
Many Rhode Island regiments are departing, in-

cluding the Providence Artillery which Reynolds
watches as the unit is vaccinated. Reynolds
mentions names of members of various military
groups. The Pawtucket Battalion (Co. A) is de-

 
Warren, dvames, ur. 4b

 

scribed as the best drilled (a part of the 9th
R. I. Regiment enlisted for three months).

June 11, 1861: Samuel Pyke of Providence
notes James Warren, Jr., has been in Washington,
D. C., at Camp Sprague. The 2nd R. I. was at
Camp Burnside, which is briefly described.

June 23, 1861: E. B. Vannever writes that
Massachusetts is to raise ten regiments in forty

days, lists some members of the lst Mass. Vol.
Militia, and describes the large number of men
unable to enlist in the early regiments who have
gone to New York State to join up.

 
Warren, James, Jr.

 

Both James Warren and his brother Charles
Augustus joined the army for three months, but
neither left an account of First Manassas in
which they participated. Both returned home,
but Charles re-enlisted in March, 1862, fighting
at Yorktown and Williamsburg, according to
his mother’s letters to James Warren. The
letters continue with casual comment on the war,
mentioning on Oct. 12, 1862, friends wounded at
Antietam, and, on July 13 and 15, 1863, Irish
riots in Boston.

 
Warren, James, Jr. 6

17 items added, 4-4-67, are letters by the
family and friends of James Warren. His wife
Lizzie writes of family and friends. A few
undated letters are of little consequence. J.He
Hammond probably Mrs. Warren's brother, writes
on Aug. 22, 1862 [?], from Eckington General
Hospital in Washington, to express disillusion-
ment with Rhode Island officers.

This collection lacks letters of Rhode Island

soldiers.

Thomas Warton (1728-1790) was an historian
of English literature and a poet. His bibliog-
raphy of histories, poetry, and editions of
Other authors is extensive.

Waterhouse first began to write.In 1786 he con-
trasted Boston to Newport at the end of the

 
Waterhouse, Benjamin 4
Revolution, telling Mrs. Champlin of the frivo-
lity and the shipping boom at Boston. Here he
also remarked about the "illiberal, unscientific
minds" he found among his Harvard colleagues,
whose jealousy had stirred up a "combination"
against him. (This situation foreshadowed his
final fight and resignation in 1812). He also

 

wrote to Mr. [Christopher?] Champlin, referring
in 1792 to the inoculations he was giving. This
letter came at the height of the French Revolu-
tion; the French had "gone mad" with the execu-
tion of their’ King. The son of this family ,

and gone to France for further education. On
his return he married, Waterhouse began in 1792
a series of letters to Christopher Grant. Champ-

tor from Rhode Island. The letters continuetill
1821.

With a controversy raging on the question
"inoculation", Waterhouse > urged Isaiah Thomas
Worcester to use his newspaper to further the
"doctrine of Kiné fock." (Waterhouse had recéi-
ved information from his friend, the English
physician J. C. Lettsom, with the result that

 

he began a crusade for vaccination which made
him the Jenner of the U. S.)

tion of her papers. She wrote
(Oliver) Waterhouse in 1813.

By 1810 Waterhouse was again experiencing
trouble from "enemies" in the Federalist Party
who were also Harvard physicians and faculty.
He wrote of this to Gen. J. B. Varnum, giving
opinions of the election in Massachusetts of

 

William Gray (1750-1825) and Elbridge Gerry
(1744-1814); on Nathaniel Macon; and on the
House of Brunswick in England.

With the proposal of John Warren, John Col-
lins Warren, and James Jackson to move the medi-
cal school to Boston to be near the Mass. General]
Hospital, the feud between these Federalist phy-
Sicians and Waterhouse came to a climax. Water-
house letters base their ehmity on pdlitical
grounds, as he was a Jeffersonian. No mention
is made of the fact he was not in sympathy with
clinical methods of instruction. ‘These "enemies"
deprived Waterhouse of his position on the Har-
vard faculty, of his vaccine institute, and of

his position as head of the Marine Hospital.

wrote to William Bentley of Salem calling the
Mass, Medical Society a Feder: lists junto. In
two letters to Benjamin Rush, 12 and 1813, he
gave details of the situation. He sent his son,
John Fothergill, to Philadelphia to medical
school. At this time Waterhouse was seeking
government help and refers to Jefferson and
Madison. About 1814 he was appointed hospital
Surgeon and director of the 2nd military district
of the U. S. Army.

The interesting letter to John Adams in 1815

gave opinions on the War of 1812 and the New
Orleans campaign. No admirer of the "Washington
Superstition," Waterhouse hailed Andrew Jackson
military success as a triumph over Washington's
record.

To President Timothy Dwight of Yale went
a long description of an historical painting
involving Dean George Berkeley, Sir James Dal-
ton, et al, by Boston artist John Smybert. The
Subject was the proposed erection of a Church of
England College for the conversion of the India

American colleges,

In 1821 Waterhouse wrote to Christopher G.
Champion concerning Abraham Redwood Ellery, a
student who had been a protege of Waterhouse
earlier at Harvard. A sketch of the grandfather
Abraham Redwood (1709-1788), Quaker philanthro-

pist of Newport, R. I., is given together with a
comment on the attacks of the Federalist, Samuel
Dana, upon an obituary of A. R. Ellery by Water-
house.

A number of letters reminiscent of his past
friends and the great personalities he had met

 
Waterhouse, ar

begin at this period. On Aug. 1¢ 1833,he made
extensive comment to Henry A. S. Deart born (1783-
1851) on the manuscript biography of his father,
General Henry Dearborn (1751-1829). The Water-
house reference to the Revolutionary War and
the battle of Bunker Hill mention Timothy Picke-
ring, Prof. McKean, General John Brooks, George
Washington, and Parson Palfrey. For the removal
of General Dearborn during the War of 1812 ws
Secretary of War Armstrong, and Presiden 1i-
son, Waterhouse gave a medical lin
of Dearborn with fever at the

The War of 1812 killed the Federalist
of New England, a group of Nelli es who
split the Union. Andrew Jackson finished n
with his New Orleans victory. And Waterhouse
believed Jackson would also hold the South Caro-
lina nullifiers in line.

In May, 1834, Jared Sparks, Harvard histor-

 

lan, begins to receive a series of letters from
his "bookworm" neighbor, who was lending him
letters and materials. The letters deal with
biographies of Thomas Jefferson; with the Eng
lish historian of the American Revolution,

 
Waterhouse, Benjamin 16

 

William Gordon (1728-1807), and his relations
with Samuel Adams; with John Hancock's charac-
ter and service as Harvard treasurer; with his
bound volume of correspondence from#ohn Adams ;
with Andrew Jackson's illness; with the charac-
ter of Joseph Priestley; and with the work by

 

Samuel George Morton on skulls, Crania Americana

The undated material contains notes by Water
house to William Jenks, his sans' tutor, and to
Jared Sparks.

Waterhouse received correspondence from

 
Waterhouse, Benjamin 2 17
samuel Webber, President of Harvard ; and he

also wrote to James Lever, Parker Cleaveland,
William Winthrop, and Abraham Hilliard.

Early letters concerning Waterhouse's vaccire
first used in July, 1800, are in the papers of
Josiah and Levy Bartlett. of New Hampshire.

The journal of Benjamin Waterhouse on a
journey in the Lake George-sec tion of New York
and to Saratoga Springs is dated 1794. Yet

Th@s photostat copy begins with a trip to the
battlefield of Saratoga in company with a Penn-
sylvanian and the party of General Horatio Gates
After a discourse on spectacles, the télescope,
and the microscope, Waterhouse plunges into a
description of the American and British armies
between Sept. 20 and Oct. 7, 1777. He comments

on the histories of Saratoga by Chastellux and
William Gordon, on the characters of Gates,
George Washington, and John Surgoyne. Then he
relates the deadly accuracy of the American
riflemen and analyzes the American Revolutionary

Army. While commenting on th e

Gates and Benedict Arnold, h escribes Arnold's
famous charge. British Ge Vaughn's role in
the battle, the surrender of Kirgoyne, and the
Germay troops Serving with the British are also
discussed¥ The murder of Miss McRea near Ft.
Edward is followed by a discourse on Jonathan

 

Mayhew, D. D.

During his journey in the Lake George region
he gives a charming and learned penta on fish
and fishing. General Gates and his party are

course on the developnent of the Ne York fron-

tier. He then launches into « description of

fire fighting in Boston and Philadelphia dnd

into the history of the Boston fire of 1794.
Benjamin Waterhouse not only was a very able

physician and natural scientist; he had

understanding of other professions and

life. He contrasts the courts and laws

York and Massachusetts, stressing the

amount of litigation in land titles in. New ; York.

After noting the i. oe Eng lis he
analyzes the practice of inal law in London
and in the United States, He believes ina
relationship between education of children and
obedience to the law. In his discourse on law-
yers, he comments on thé medical afflictions,
particularly hypochondriac disorders.

Following a discourse on the theatre in
Boston, he describes the Mohawk River Valley
around Troy and Albany. In his comment on Ameri
can inns, he tells a story of an American inn-
keeper and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent. On his

way to Lebanon Springs he writes a section on
mental diseases and insanity, including "Hypo-
chondriasis," the history of medicine, the
treatment of the insane in the U. S., and the
Suicide of Werkin at Hingbham, Mass. Here he
includes a letter on this celebrated case to Dr.
Barker of Hingham dated Feb. 20, 1796. The
journal concludes with an excellent account of
the Shaker settlement at Lebanon, N. Y.

Earl of Chatham, was the author, and he so
states in his "An Essay on the Junius Letters"

are controversial writings on British politics.)
The second letter is an introduction by Dr.

WATSON, HENRY, JR. MSS. 1765 - 88a
HISTORICAL SKETCH.
East Windsor, Connecticut was the
birthplace of at least two generations of
Watsons. A literary scholar of no mean
ability, John Watson (d. 1824) was a fre
quent contributor to Joel Barlow's American

Mercury. The collection includes some fif-—
teen manuscript -pieces of his efforts.

By a first marriage the elder Wat-
son had three sons. John (d. 1815) was
a captain in the 4th Connecticut (Contin-
ental Army). William (d. ca. November

 
WATSON, H., Jr. Historical sketch. 2
1836) a New York lawyer and editor of an
anonymous anti - slavery sheet, was the
father of five children: Mary Ann; William;
Elizabeth; Sally, and John March (b. 1618}.
Henry, perhaps the oldest brother, lived in
comparative ease at East Windsor where he

 

observed the maturing habits of ten sons ami
two daughters: Henry (b. 1810); Julia (b.
ca. 1812); Theodore (b. ca. 1814); Alf-
fred (b. ca. 1816); Louis (b. 1818); E-
benezer Bliss (b. 1820); Cornelius(b. ca.
1822); Edmund (b. 1824); Sereno (i Dec. 1,

Donald (b. 1830); Harriet (b. 1832).

Fully two-thirds of the correspondence
concerns the activities of Henry Watson, Jr.
With a college degree and the confidence of
a twenty-one-year—old he went to Greens-
borough, Alabama - January, 1831 - where he
signed an unfulfilled contract to teach the
three "Rs", English grammer, geography, and
history, rhetoric, Latin, Greek. June, 1833
however, found young Watson in Hartford, Con
necticut studying law with Henry Barnard
in the office of William H. Hungerford. By

By New Year's Day, 1834 the incipient law-
yer was again in Greensborough, Alabama.

In that traditionally anti-Democratic
district Henry Watson, Jr. built up a jucrat-
ive practice, accumulated property - a plant
ation and slaves - established the Planter's
Insurance Company, married Sophia (Peck #);

 

subsequently became the father of four child

politics. For appreciable but biag@ed ob-
servations Watson's correspondence for the
years 1836 - 1844 should merit consideration
in historical research projects of the period
Furthermore, his efforts to dispose of his

 

paternal grandfather's two shares in the
Ohio Land Company produced a mass of communi
cations revealing some hitherto neglected
aspects of that speculation.

Until 1883 when he disposed of his Greens-
borough property Watson enjoyed an annual
winter excursion to the community where he
had prospered. He died on Feb. 10, 1891.

George Washington Watts (1851-1921), promi-
nent Durham industrialist, was the son of
Gerald S. Watts of Baltimore, Md. As a young
man he purchased an interest in the Washington
Duke and Sons tobacco enterprises. Coming to

 

Durham about 1878 he became active in social,
civic, and business affairs, and helped to pro-
mote the Lyceum. Meetings were held at which
members read essays, debated, and discussed
Cultural affairs. According to William Kenneth
Boyd's The Story of Durham, pp. 259-261, in

 

 
Watts, George Washington 32
1881 George Watts read at one of these meetings
"a prophecy, in the form of a letter supposed

to have been written twenty years after 1881,
describing some of the changes in the city."
This prophecy is the item composing this collect
ion. It is’ humorous and far-fetched spoof con-

 

cerning the growth of the city of Durham, and
the futures of Eugene Morehead, James South-
gate, S. F. Tomlinson, James Dike, Bartholomew
Fuller, George Miller, and Dr. Carr.

This collection contains a letter from Isaac
Watts to a Mrs. Fay. The letter, dated April
15, 1701, expresses Wattsts sympathy for the
recently widowed Mrs. Fay. Watts pointed out
to Mrs. Fay that her husband's death also had

salutary effects for his widow since her mind
would consequently be directed not to worldly

He reminded Mrs. Fay, however, that even in her

present state in this world she was in a better

 
Watts, Isaac 2
position than the "Saints in France" who had
suffered economic as well as spiritual perse-
cution. Watts suggested many scriptural
passages that Mrs. Fay might find comforting.
The remainder of this collection is for the
most part written in shorthand. An attempt to
provide a key to the shorthand used in these

 

volumes was included with this collection, but
it is actually of very little assistance, and na
attempt has been made to catalogue the contents
of these volumes.

A manuscript of a sérman dated Dec. 31, 1775

 
Watts, Isaac &
and July 6, 1788, is included, but its author
is unidentified.

There are two volumes of extracts from the
Bible: Volume I containing extracts from
Genesis through Joel, and Volume II Amos
through Acts.

Three volumes of a diary, 1749-1753, are

 

signed by a Sarah Ashurst. The diary appears
to contain Miss Ashurst's spiritual reflections
or discussions of theological points, as in
Volume II, pp. 91, 124, 160.

Two letter books of Joseph Parker, Isaac

 
Watts, Isaac 4
Watts'!s amanuensis, contain shorthand copies
of his business and personal letters. One
letter is from Isaac Watts to Richard Taunton,
Feb. 18, 1748 (Letter Book, 1747-1757, p. 13).
One volume contains extracts from the works
of such writers as Epictetus, Baxter, Law,
Tillotson, and Janeway. The extracts are

 

arranged topically under various headings, such
as Humility, Friendship, Love, Faith, Providenc¢g
etc. A table of contents is given for the

topical arrangement, but no index of the authors

represented is given.

Weaver, Philip J. Papers, 1830-1906. Selma,
Dallas County, Alabama.

 

Philip J. Weaver was born at Mifflintown,
Pennsylvania, in 1797. As a young boy he entered
the employ of a mercantile firm in Baltimore,
and about 1815 he moved to Cahaba, Alabama,
where he worked in a business that engaged in

the Indian trade. Weaver soon became the pro-
prietor of this business which he moved succes=
sively to Cahaba Falls, Maplesville, and final-
ly to Moore's Bluff, the site of Selma, Alabama.
His trade with settlers and Indians prospered,

 
Weaver, Philip J. 2
and his activities expanded. Jn 1830 he opened
a branch house at Pontotoc, Mississippi, in the
Chickasaw Nation. Two years later the Chickasaw
ceded their Mississippi land, and Weaver took
this opportunity to invest in real estate in
this region. Weaver's activities included farm-
ing, land speculation, mercantile business, and
railroad construction. He died at Selma on No-
vember 10, 1865,

Somewhat conflicting biographical accounts of
Weaver appear in the following sources: The
Alabama Historical Quarterly, Vol. IX, No. ~ Uy Ws.

 

 

 
Weaver, Philip

 

79-580; and Thomas McAdory Owen, History of Ala-
bama and Dictionary of Alabama Biography (Chica-
go, 1921), Vol. IV, pp. 1730-1737. n this col-
lection the names of Weaver's wife and surviving
children appear on two documents of April 26 and
June 6, 1867. They are Ann P. (Gardner) Weaver,
his widow, and the children- Leroy G., William
M., and Virgil G. Weaver.

This collection is almost exclusively con-
cerned with Weaver's real estate activities and
with'those of his associates. The documents co

 

 
Weaver, Philip J. ry
sist of business letters, tax receipts, lists
of property holdings, land grants, deeds, and
related memoranda and legal papers. Historical
information is confined to land, its value and
taxes, and the methods employed by speculators.
The papers represent three and a half decades
of Weaver's real estate ventures. There is evi-

 

dence of his ownership or interest in land in
Texas, Alabama, and Tennessee, but the mass of
documents relates to Mississippi, where a num-
ber of counties are involved- Desoto, Lowndes,
Tippah, Panola, Marshall, Pontotoc, Chickasaw,

 
Weaver, Philip J. 5

 

Noxubee, Oktibbeeha, Lafayette, [tawamba, and
others. Weaver was associated with Henry T.
Curtiss of New York City and later of Monroe,
Connecticut. Documents from the 1830's indicate
that Curtiss was associated with Darling Curtiss
and Company in New York City. After these years
however, Curtiss appears only as an individual.

Correspondence, legal papers, and memoranda re-
lating to the business relationship of Curtiss
and Weaver are plentiful during the four decades
from 1830-1870.

Weaver lived in Selma, Alabama, and he util-

 
Weaver, Philip J.

 

ized the device of power of attorney to authorize
agents to care for his property interests in
Mississippi. Curtiss also used this method. A
business associate and frequent correspondent of
Weaver during the 1830's and 18)0's was John N,
Wilie of Pontotoc, Mississippi. There are nume
ous letters from Wilie to Weaver as well as tax

receipts, accounts, and deeds concerning Wilie's
property. The business of Weaver and Wilie in
these papers may be the branch house of Weaver
at Pontotoc. Wilie received a power of attorney

from Weaver in 182 and one from Curtiss in 189

 
Weaver, Philip J.

 

-

(document of 1819). John N. Wilie died in 18l9,
and Edwin S. Wilie handled the affairs of his
estate with Weaver. Other powers of attorney
were given to Nathaniel Waller (May 13, 1850),
Joel Pinson (Oct. 1, 189; Aug. 8, 1850), and
Richard A. Pinson (1852; inside document of Oct.
1, 1849). There are many business letters to
Weaver from Joel Pinson at Pontotoc in 189 and
the early 1850's and from Richard Pinson there=
after. In the 1850's there are also many lette
from James C. Jones, .an'‘attorney at Pontotoc.

The documents for the 1830's are not extensive

 
Weaver, Philip J. 8

 

for any one year, but they become more numerous
for the 1840's. For 180 there are many grants
for land in the district of the land office at
Columbus, Mississippi, and a few that involve
the office at Chocchuma. Business correspondenc
is most extensive during the 1850's. The quanti
ty of documents is smaller for the war years, and
those after that time concern Weaver's estate.
Innumerable persons are involved in these land
transactions, but the information about them is
confined to the property in question.

Five volumes contain notes and orderly lists

 
Weaver, Philip J. 9

 

and descriptions of Weaver's property in each
county. One volume also has some business ac-=-
counts. His estate in the late 1860's included
considerable property in Mississippi.

William Weaver (1/781-1863[?]), an ironmaster,
appears to have been a native of Philadelphia.
Some time in the 1820's he bought the Bath Iron
Works near Goshen, Virginia. Apparently, the
business prospered, for Weaver increased his

 

holdings in Rockbridge Co. When he died (about
1863), the letters show that a relation (nephew?
D. C. E. Brady, handled the business.

The bulk of the papers are business letters
dealing with the iron industry in that part of
Va. There are many orders from retail dealers

 
Weaver, William 2

 

showing the items most in demand: bar iron,
plow points, horseshoe iron, iron strips for
wagon wheels, etc, From these orders, which
continue throughout the collection, a view of
wholesale prices is provided.

Capt. William Stewart Polk ( -1917),

On Dec, 12, 1864 Lt. Col. Richard Mor-
ton of the Confederate War Department's Nitre

and Mining Bureau orders iron from Daniel 6.

cessors to William Weaver.

 
Weaver William i)
Tied closely to production sat of iron are
the comments on the financial state of the nat-
ion. These,too, range throughout the collection
indicating the price of land, crops, livestock,
and the ease or difficulty of collecting debts.
Bank failures were noted, and Andrew Jackson's

controversy with the Bank drew opinions from

 

some of Weaver's correspondents.

Since the labor for iron manufacture at
Buffalo Forge was slave labor, many informative
letters appear on this subject. Weaver obtained
Slaves by hiring an agent to contact slave owners
for the purpose of “6 Slaves. A slave usual

 
Weaver, William if 4
ly was hired for a year at prices varying with
the times ($50. to $125.). The price of slaves ig
also revealed in the letters, and in several in-
stances, there are lists of slaves, a brief phy-
Sical description, and a comment on their reli-
ability as workers.

Weaver, of course, had to provide the necess-
ities for these slaves while they were in his
Charge. Thus the reader is afforded a view of
the staples of their diet and the retail prices.
Flour and bacon were the big items. Articles of
clothing and their prices’ are also found among
the many bills and “eo

Va., the completion of the canal from the mouth
of the Brazos River to Galveston (1853) ,politics,

about state and Confederate affairs; rumors;
and the Civil War.

 

He writes on Feb. 4, 1862, complaining of

Alexander Russell Webb (1846-1916) has
the distinction of being the first known
American convert to Islam and of being the
first person to conduct a major effort to

spread Islam within the United States.

Born in Hudson, New York, he had a short
journalistic career as editor of the St.
Joseph Gazette and Missouri Republican. In
1887 he was appointed American consul at

 

 
Webb, Alexander Russell

 

Manila. There he befriended several Indian
Muslim businessmen and studied works about
Islam. In 1888 he declared in a pamphlet
his conversion to Islam. He resigned from
the consular service in 1892 and returned
to the U. S. by way of Singapore, Penang,

Rangoon, a number of cities in India, and
possibly other places. Back in America,
Webb established an office in New York City
as the Oriental Publishing Co. In May, 1893,
he published the first issue of the Moslem

 
Webb, Alexander Russell 3

 

World, Devoted to the Interests of the Amer-
ican Islamic Propaganda, the earliest Islamic
missionary periodical in America. [In con-
nection with his "American Mission," as

Webb called it, he wrote a number of books
and pamphlets among which were several of

 

 

his lectures in India that were published
there during 1892-1893. Biographical infor-
mation about Webb appears in: Nadim al-
Maqdissi, "The Muslims of America, 80,000
Muslims and 12 Mosques in the United States

Naipaul, "An Islamic Journey, Among the
Believers," The Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 248,
No. 2 (Aug., 1981), p. 63. Copies of the

 

 

 

pertinent pages from these sources are filed

in the Information Folder in this collection.
The collection contains Webb's "Journal

No. 1, From Manila to Calcutta " (142 pp.),

 
Webb, Alexander Russell 5
Aug. 29-Oct. 19, 1892, and his "Journal No.

2, From Calcutta to Bombay and Agra"(144 pp.),
Oct. 20-Dec. 15, 1892. This is the first
journal that Webb ever wrote (Vol. 1, p. l).
His journal continued beyond Vol. 2; the

last sentence was continued elsewhere, and

 

no pages appear to be missing from this
volume. A later volume or volumes contained
the account of the rest of his journey
which is incomplete here.

Webb's descriptive style is good. and he

 
Webb, Alexander Russell 6

 

did extensive touring wherever he went.
Thus, his volumes are good travel journals.
The most important feature of his account
is his contact with Muslim scholars, re-
ligious leaders, businessmen, rulers, ordi-
nary people, etc. Beginning in Rangoon, he

and his mission to spread Islam in America
were enthusiastically received not only by
individuals but literally by throngs of
well-wishers. He was received by many
influential Muslims, and his comments about

 
Webb, Alexander Russell

 

some of them are quite interesting. Webb
did not like the English or local people
who catered to them, and this attitude,
often expressed, colored his reactions to
persons whom he met. Some of the signifi-
cant Muslims whom he discussed have been
identified by using S. M. Ikram's Modern

Muslim India and the Birth of Pakistan
(Lahore, 1977). Spellings of names are
given as Webb wrote them unless they are
found written otherwise in Ikram's book or

The papers of Mary Webb contain a number of
ballads. She called her poem dated Nov. 30,
1797, a “song ballet.” Whether or not this is
original poetry by her, the ballads are certain-
ly eighteenth century and English in feeling.

In Henry County, Kentucky (later Trimble
County) the Marshalls and the Webbs were
neighboring landholders along the Ohio River.
Here in the graveyard of the old Marshall house
is buried Polly (Mary Marshall) Webb (Nov. 10,

1776-Aug. 25, 1850), who married William Webb,

William Webb, Sr.(1741-June 15, 1827) and his
wife Mary Webb (b. March 14, 1749), who were
married December 7, 1769. It is a reasonable
presumption that the ballads were in the posses-
sion of this family group.

 

These poems were written by or in the posses-
sion of Mary Webb. She signed three of the
ballads dated in 1798 and 1799, all in the same
manuscript. The second and longer manuscript,

Sidney James Webb, First Baron Passfield
(1859-1947), was a British social reformer and
historian.

On July 10, 1920, he wrote to an unidentified
addressee, declining a speaking engagement and
defining generally the conditions that he set
for giving lectures.

On May 8, 1928, Webb wrote to a Col. Burdon
and remarked on their different politics, his
support of ratification of the new Prayer Book,

his decision to retire as Seaham's member in

the House of Commons, and the franchise rights
of domestic servants. The addressee is likely
Colonel Rowland Burdon (1857-1944), a Conser-
vative Unionist politician whose country
residence was at Castle Eden several miles
south of Seaham.

noted lecture engagements for Feb., 1907.

On July 25, 1907, he discussed Miles's wish
to retire from his connection with the

 

Lewisham Grammar School and its relationship
to the plans of the municipal reformers.

On Feb. 12, 1907, Webb acknowledged a
reference for a work then in the press and a

comment on another recent book from Sir John
Harold Clapham, historian. He also noted the

Thomas B. Webber's home was a plantation nea

was not more than 25 miles from Byhalia, Miss.
Apparently, however, Webber's parental home was

Just over the state line in Mississippi. Thomas

One brother, Watt Webber, was killed October

At the dtbreak of the Civil War Thomas Webber
Was a mercHant in Byhalia, Mississippi, associat
ed with his cousin, John Watkins, under the firm
name of Webber and Watkins which was dissolved
March 9, 1861. He moved his goods to Oxford,

Tne first papers in this collection are
letters from a young man by the name of San-
ford to his girl friend, Sarah M. Webster.
This fellow went from Conn. to Springfield,

Tenn, then to Gallatin, Tenn., and later to
Nashville, He was a carriage maker by trade.
While he was in Springfield he was deeply de-
pressed by the low type of civilization that
he encountered there, and which he attributed

 
Webster, E. W. Sketch, 2
to the system of slavery. He wrote regarding a
slave auction, giving the prices for which some
of the Negroes were sold, When he reached Galla
tin, he encountered a much more progressive
society and high wages.

By 1854, Sanford had moved to Nashville. His
letters continue from there through Mar., 1855.

 

He writes of cholera in that city, the wicked-
ness of its society, the lack of a proper sewer-
age system, mosquitoes, numerous steamboat
accidents on the western waters, arrest of a
mulatto boy and girl in Nashville who had been

 
Webster, E. W. Sketch. te)
manumitted by their white father in Ga. and were
on their way to a free state, a strike among
printers, and different forms of entertainment.
In 1857, the letters of E. W. Webster of

Plainville, Conn. began. He may have been the
father of Sarah Webster, wince her father was

a carriage maker. All of the letters concern

 

the purchase and sale of carriages and debts
owed Webster, but some of them also contain
comments on current affairs. Before the Civil
War he received orders for buggies, carriages,
and wagons from Ala., Fla., Ga., Tenn., Ky.,

 
Webster, E. W. Sketcn., 4
Tex., and Cal., where he had agencies.

In a letter of Dec.,1860 regarding the possi-
bility of establishing an agency in Springfield,
Ill., Wm. H. Herndon, who advised against lettin
certain men have the agency, is referred to as a
man of "undoubted character" Some of the let-
ters from Webster's agents give a picture of the
severing of business ties between the North and
South with the coming of the Civil War and the
renewal of such after the conflict. Correspon-
dence written after the war starts paints a
dark picture relative to collecting debts which
Southerners owe a especially since

Mason Locke Weems (1759-1825) , Episcopal
clergyman, book agent, writer, was born at
Marshes Seat, Anne Arundel county, Md., nine-
teenth child of David and Esther (Hil1)Weems.

Of Weems' youth there is little known. In 1783
when abroad he was in correspondence with John
Adams and Benjamin Franklin concerning obstacles
to ordination, the British law still requiring

the oath of allegiance. This abrogated in August
1784, Weems and Edward Ganet were the first to .
receive Anglican ordination for service in the
U.S. Ordained by the bishop of Chester, Weems
was admitted to the priesthood in September,
1784, by the archbishop of Canterbury. Returning
to Maryland, he served from 1784-1792 in All

 

Hallaws and St. Margaret's parishes.
' On July 2, 1795 Weems married Frances Ewell
and settled amongst her people in Dumfries, Va.

As a seller of books, and after 1794 as

 
Weems, Mason Locke. (3)

Mathew Carey's agent, he wandered up and down
the coast from New York City to Savannah for
thirty-one years. He fostered the publication
of the workd of Oliver Goldsmith, William
Guthrie, James Harvey, William Coxe, and others.
Carey's edition of the Bible, suggested by Weems
sold widely. In all his editing, writing, and

 

compiling, Weems showed wide knowledge of gen-
eral literature and the Bible.

In the Philanthropist (1799) and in the True
Patriot (1802) he preached a doct#tne similar

 

 
Weems, Mason Locke. (4)

to theological universalism. His great work,
The Life and Memorable Actions of George Wash-
ington, and his Life of General Francis Marion
are early examples of ultra modern Bictionized
biograph. The first, although severely criticis-
ed, was a second best seller in its day and ran
through seventy editions, including five in
German. In the fifth edition the hatchet and
cherry-tree story first appeared. His Life of
Dr. Benjamin Franklin and the Life of William

Penn are of little value. Besides his historica’
works he wrote Several moralizing tracts: Goa

Revenge Against a Druhkard's Looking

Glass, and others of similar nature. His let-
ters throw a great deal of light on the taste of
the reading public of his day. He died at Beau-
fort,S.C.,whence his remains were removed to his
home, Bel Air, near Dumfries, Va.

The collection contains two letters: one ad-
dressed to Mathew Carey is a business letter in

 

which sparkling wit and humor is displayed; the
other is a letter of introduction for his son to
James Webb. The letters are interesting because
of the author,and as an example of his styke of
writing rather than for the material contained

therein, ;

The collection consists of one bound volume
and one loose item. The volume contains 131
pages of text; however, several pages are miss-
ing. The first 47 pages contain a compendium

of lawsuits and cases aired before agents of the
U. S. Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Aban-
doned Lands (the Freedmen's Bureau), in N. C.
during 1865-1868. Pages 48-52 contain a printed
copy of the constitution of the state of North

Carolina dated March 16, 1868. It has been
pasted into the volume. Pages 53-54 are a
record of large quantities of fruit that has
been imported in 1858 from Cadiz, Spain. It is
not stated what organization has ordered it.The
bulk of the Wolume (pp. 55-128 & 131) contains
notes and explanations of different statutes

 

and laws kept by Weld. The loose item in the
collection contains printed questions from the
Columbia College Law School for the Seventh
Prize Examination, dated Friday, April 26, 1872.

 
Weld, Manchester Ward 2
Weld graduated from the Columbia College Law
School in 1872 and is listed as a lawyer in the
1875 New York City directory.

Entries in the first 22 pages of the volume
relating to the Freedmen's Bureau (May, 1865
until August, 1865) were kept by Justin Hodge,
Captain in the U. S. Army and Assistant Super-
intendent Sub. District. He was mustered out
of the Army in October, 1866. Beginning on
page 24 and for the rest of the section on the
Freedmen's Bureau (August, 1865 to March, 1868)

 

 
Weld, Manchester Ward 4
entries were made by Weld, who identifies him-
self as an agent for Harnett and Moore counties
located in North Carolina. These pages have at
the top Jonesboro, Moore County, N. C.

This volume used by Weld and earlier by Hodge
was apparently appropriated from a local source.

 

Pages 129-130 contain records of sales of blast-
ing powder by the Hagard Powder Co. dated in
1857 at Fayetteville, N. C.

Many of the cases heard before the Freedmen's
Bureau were held before the agent of the Bureau

 
Weld, Manchester Ward 5
in Moore County. Disputes included those over
crops, animals and payment for services render-
ed. Several involved the efforts of black men
to recover their wives from white owners who
refused to set them free. The decisions made
in several of these cases are written either
under or over the summary of the cases ina
different colored ink. Some of the cases were
referred to the nearest magistrate. On page 29
there is a report given of the number of ration
given to destitute whites and Freedmen. The

 

 
Weld, Manchester Ward

amount of rations for destitute whites and
"Freedpeople" are entered on separate lines.
Several other references are made about concerns
for the poor in Moore and Harnett counties. In
one particular case where a Freedman refused to
answer a summons issued by an agent of the Freed

 

men's Bureau, the wrath and distaste for "Ne-
groes" are delineated and railed against by the
agent.

The notes pertaining to legal statutes and
laws cover in some detail those pertaining to

 
Weld, Manchester Ward ts
easements, landlords and tenants, trusts, and
trustees and estates. There are scattered re-
ferences to laws governing these topics in New
York State and how these topics are handled in
English law. There are also scattered refer-
ences made to particular cases, illustrating
the legal topics under discussion.

Gideon Welles (1802-1878), Secretary of
the Navy, was born in Glastonbury, Connecticut.
For ten years he was editor of the Hartford
Times, and then in 1836 he became Postmaster
at Hartford until 1841. From 1827 to 1835

he was in the Connecticut Legislature. Other
major career responsibilities included his
connection with the Navy, as Chief of the
Bureau of Provisions and Clothing (1846-1849)

 
Welles, Gideon 2
and as U.S, Secretary of the Navy (1861-1869).
He also established the Republican paper, the
Hartford Evening Press.

Donald M, Fairfax, a naval officer, wrote
the letter to Welles probably in the 1870's.
Although the letter is undated, it was written
from New London, Connecticut, where Fairfax

 

 

was stationed during that time. In the letter
he wrote of voting for delegates to the Gen-
eral Convention. Also, he spoke very highly
of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, but

 
Welles, Gideon 3

evidently had a low opinion of General Grant.
1 item added, 9-6-78: a letter to Welles
from Commodore Charles Wilkes (1798-1877),
dated May 13, 1863. Wilkes wrote the letter
primarily to report that certain American
ships were paying for papers from the Confed-
erate government in order to avoid inter-

 

ception. He also mentioned several vessels
including the Alabama, Oneida, Wachusett,
Vanderbilt, and Peterhoff.

The collection contains six letters from
Virginia (Loyall) Farragut, wife of Admiral
David G, Farragut, to Welles, dating from Oct.
19, 1866 to Nov. 7, 1869. Two letters lack
year dates.

The subjects covered include Admiral Farra-

gut's health, family news and references to
military and political figures, including
George Henry Preble. Ms. Farragut gave an un-
favorable review of Edward Alfred Pollard's
work The Lost Cause, a New Southern History of

 

 
Welles, Thomas Glastonbury
the War of the Confederates. She said the
content of the book contained only "brazen
assertions, illiterate opinions, and narrow
minded prejudices." Pollard's works were de-
scribed in the Dictionary of American Biography
as "journalistic, unscientific, bitterly pre-
judiced, and often unjust, yet possessed of a
certain power and, at times, keen judgment."

Ms. Farragut expressed her feelings about how
unpredictable death can be. She advised Welles,
who had decided to study law, "to turn your

particular attention to the laws on alimony for
divorce," She mentioned how lucrative it could
be for the man "who can make the most advan-

1 item added, 4-1-63: Letter from Henry
Wellesley, First Baron Cowley, diplomat and |
brother of the Duke of Wellinzton, to Neumam,
apparently Baron Philipp von Neumann, second
efficial in the Austrian embassy at London.
The letter is undated, but its contents
indicate middle or late May, 1832. Cowley notes

 

that Wellington has informed the King that he
is unable to form a government. The King then
saw Grey, "and it is reported among the Whigs
that no new Peers are to be made, and that they

expect to be able to pass the [Reform] Bill

 
Wellesley, Arthur a 4

 

without any new creation." Cowley thinks,
however, that the Whigs will have to offer
concessions. He stresses the point that Welling
ton has not accepted any office; the Duke has
only agreed to try to form a government. The
events discussed in this letter are noted in

E. Beresford Chancellor, ed., The Diary of
Philipp von Neumann, (London, 1928), I, 270-

21 items added, 6-4-64. On May 29, 1825,

Wellington notifies the Duke of Cambridge of the

 

 
Wellesley, Arthur 12
granting of a leave of absence for a Hanoverian
officer on whose behalf Cambridge has written.
On Nov. 2, 1826, Wellington mentions the Hano-
verian again and discusses the condition of the
Duke of York who is ill. He also writes to
Cambridge on April 13, 1825.

On August 8, 1827, George Canning died. The
ministry continued under Lord Goderich with
John Charles Herries as Chancellor of the
Exchequer and Wellington as commander of the
army. On August 17 the Duke writes to the Earl

 

 
 

Wellesley, Arthur 13
of Westmorland and explains his acceptance o e
army command. He reports on a conversation with
Lord Anglesey who stated that the King wanted
Herries at the Exchequer. Herries' acceptance
is doubtful, and Palmerston is the King's second
choice. A decade later, July 30, 1838, the Duke
refers to his resignation of the army command.

On September, 2, 1834, the Duke complains
about what he considers a misuse of the practice
of petitioning the King and Parliament.

On Jan. 10, 1835, Wellington writes a memoran

 
Wellesley, Arthur as 14
dum on the case of George Lenox Conyngham, a
senior clerk at the Foreign Office whose status
and salary 4areunder consideration. The duties
and salaries of the senior clerks are noted.

On June 1, 1836, Wellington informs Edward
Thompson at Dover that he cannot present his
petition. The Duke wants to be able to vote

 

freely when the House of Lords considers the
railroads.

On July 30, 1838, Wellington discusses his
abstinence from interference with the policies

 
Wellesley, Arthur 15
and patronage of the army during the decade
Since he resigned as commander-in-chief. He is
writing to Sir James Henry Reynett, a colonel
and later a general of the army, who complained
about his lack of advancement in the service.

On July 5, 1837, the Duke invites to his
home in London General Marie Etienne Francois
Henri Baudrand of France and the members of his
mission.

On Jan. 15, 1848, the Countess of Blesington
asks Wellington to assist her nephew, John

and Second Earl of Mornington. Papers, 1801-
1820, London, England,

This collection relates to Richard Colley
Wellesley, Marquis Wellesley and Second Earl of
Mornington (1760-1842), Governor General of
India. Marquis Wellesley was the brother of
Arthur Wellesley, First Duke of Wellington.
This correspondence concerns the visit of the
Marquis to Spain as Ambassador extraordinary to
the Spanish government at Seville in 1809. At
that time the British and the Spanish Géntral

Junta were fighting the French forces of Joseph

and Napoleon Bonaparte. Most of these letters
are contemporary copies.

There are five letters to Wellesley from
Martin de Garay, Principal Secretary of State in
Spain. On Aug. 19, 1809 (2 items), Garay urges
that Wellington's forces aid General Guia at the

 

Guadiana River, and he reports various troop

movements. On Aug. 23 Garay replies to Wellesley
that his proposals for provisioning the army are
being sent to the Junta. Meanwhile measures will
be taken to comply with them. Several weeks latex

(Sept. 13) the Spaniard suggests that Wellington
and Beresford unite their armies with that of
the Duque del Parque. He also reports the trans-
fer of 20,000 men from Guia's command in
Estremadura to La Mancha. On Sept. 14 Garay di
cusses a financial transaction between Spain and

 

England which involves the transfer of three
million dollars from Mexico, While this sum is
being shipped, Britain is to allow Spain to
issue bills of exchange on the English treasury.

 
Wellesley, Richard Colley, Marquis Wellesley 4
and Second Earl of Mornington.

There are four letters from Wellesley to
Spanish officials. On Yet. 20, 1809, he prods
Garay and the Junta to facilitate a general
prisoner exchange with the French and requests
the release of several French officers. A week
later (Oct. 26) he announces his intention to

 

return to England. Wellesley next replies to
Garay's notice of resignation’as chief secretary
(Oct. 31), and he soon congratulates Garay's
successor, Francisco de Saavedra (Nov. 7).

On Apr. 19, 1810, Spencer Perceval, First

 
Wellesley, Richard Colley, Marquis Wellesley 5
and Second Earl of Mornington,

 

Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the
Exchequer, writes about a proposed loan and
commertéad treaty with Spain (63 pp.). Perceval
suggests a loan of 1,500,000 pounds sterling,
and he discusses how this sum should be ad-
vanced. An essential accompaniment of this loan,
however, is a commercial treaty which would
open both Spain and her colonies to British
trade. Perceval also gives specifications for
this trade agreement.

Another item (Sept. 18097) has a lengthy

 
Wellesley, 4ichard Colley, Marquis Wellesley 6

discussion of the problems arising from an ex-
tension of a credit of 400,000 pounds to Spain
by Lord Wellesley. The writer of this document
is a member of the British cabinet and may be

An item of ca. Apr., 1813, has reports of
military movements in Spain and of the situation
at Majorca (by H. Scott).

The material in this collection supple-
ments the extensive correspondence on the same
subjects which is in the published papers of

and Second Earl of Mornington,
the Duke of Wellington. Consult both Arthur
Wellesley, Supplementary Despatches, Correspon-

1837-1839), 13 vols. Additional material is in
Robert Rouiere Pearce, Memoirs and Correspon-

Admiral Keith, one of the English commanders in
the Mediterranean, writes from Aboukir Bay,
Egypt, about the progress of British forces

3 items added, 8-23-61. This addition has a
military commission from India (Apr. 18, 1805),
and a letter from Marquis Wellesley to Sir John
Coxe Hippisley, First Baronet, in which Wellesl6
refers to their consultations about the re-
moval of disabilities against Roman Catholics.

Also included is an order (Feb. 12, 18207)
of George IV which summons subjects and officers
to enforce all parliamentary acts which relate
to the collection of taxes in Ireland. The King
authorizes his revenue officers to call for such

 

assistance (Transferred from Arthur Wellesley,

10 items added, 6-8-64. Contemporary copies
of several documents concern the capture of
Seringapatam, the capital of Mysore, May 4,
1799, by forces under the command of General
George Harris.

Harris's general orders of May 5 contain his

 

congratulations to the successful army and the
public recognition of numerous officers and
military units for meritorious service. On
page three of this document is an extract from

and Second Earl of Mornington.

Harris's general orders of May 8 in which he
quotes Major General Baird's citation of an
officer.

Harris's letter of May 7, 1799, to Governor
General Wellesley is a three and one-half page
report on the capture of Seringapatam and the
events thereafter. At the end of the letter
s is a return of the casualties suffered on
May 4.

There is a preliminary abstract of the

ordnance, stores, and magazines captured at
Seringapatam. This report is from P. A. Agnew,
military secretary. He is apparently Patrick

A. Agnew, Deputy Adjutant General on Harris's
staff at Fort St. George, Madras.

On Feb. 1, 1802, Baron Grenville writes to
Wellesley and recommends James Majoribanks, who
is going to Bengal as a writer.

Modern copies of the documents from Sering-
apatam suggest their use by an historian. Three

ilar handwriting.
On Feb. 17, 1805, Arthur Wellesley notes the

arrival of a fleet from England and the news

that it brings.
Two letters of 1803-1804 are apparently

 

addressed to Lord Wellesley. On March 7, 1803,
Lord Melville writes in behalf of Archibald
Cockburn, a close relative who went out to
Bengal but has not prospered there. A pencilled

 
Wellesley, Richard Colley, Marquis Wellesley 15
and Second Earl of Mornington

 

notation cites Wellesley as the addressee, and
the content of the letter is appropriate. On
June 2, 1804, Melville conveys a recommendation
of Andrew and Daniel Seton and a memorial for
arrears of salary due their late father, who
was formerly in Surat, India. The notations on

page four are similar to those that Wellesley o
his secretaries made on other letters that he
received. (especially Arthur Wellesley's letter
of Feb. 17, 1805). The letter took eleven

months to reach its destination.

1 item added, 12-10-66. On Jan. 10, 1802,
Lord Wellesley wrote an extensive letter (113pp.)
to Henry Addington. In 1802 Governor General
Wellesley applied for leave to resign because
of his conflicts with the Court of Directors
of the East India Company, and this letter is

 

an explanation of his position. It includes
information on: the relationships of the
Directors, the Governor General, and the
presidency governments; the control of patron-

age; the Board of Trade; the government of

 
Wellesley, Richard Colley, Marquis Wellesley 13%

officials including Josiah Webbe, John Chamier,
William Kirkpatrick, Lt. Col. Scott, Capt.

Hook, Peter Speke, John Bristow, David Scott,
Arthur Wellesley, Henry Wellesley, and George
Udney.

 

The letter is a contemporary copy bearing
watermarks of 1798. It is apparently not in
Wellesley's handwriting.

Oct. 22, 1812, concerned a dinner engagement

of English and Comparative Literature for many
years. He devoted three score and more years to
the study and teaching of poetry and drama.
While serving as Curator of the Brander Matthews
Dramatic Museum at Columbia, he became deeply
interested in Asian theatre and drama. His
critical assessment of the plays of China, In-

 

dia, and Japan are a pleasure to read for they

Artha Wescoat, a fifteen-year-old Confederate

boy from Edisto Island, who was a refugee

 

with his family in Berkeley County above

and Julia. Adaline was the wife of Mr. Fripp
of Edisto Island, in the "R,bel Troop" in
which Brothers Dave and Sidney served in the

1863, many details of the bathle for Ft. Wag-

ner on Morris Island and the bombardment of

Ft. Sumter are recorded, Heavy. casualties

 

among U.S. Army Negro troops are noted, partic
ularly at Ft, Wagner. Prices soar in Charles-
ton as shells fall in the city. On Sept. 2,
1863, Ft. Moultrie is attacked.

The gunboats blockading the sea islands

 
Wescoat, Artha Brailsford 9
provide almost continuous fighting, particu-

larly on John's Island, where the U.S.S.

Marblehead plays its role in a battle on
hristmas Day, 1863,

During all this, the Wesceat family
finally gets quarters in order at "California,

 

moving there in Jan., ots and the children

continue to go to school. Interesting comment
on Young Wescoat's edustion, mention of
plantation fires, and debates at the Citadel
on Apr. 6, 1864, are followed by a visit to

 
 

Wescoat, Artha Braj lsford -'
the troops on John's Island. Their shortness

of rations is relieved by sending to family
plantations for food, The Federal prisoners
taken at Pkymouth, N. C., appear in Charleston
on Apr. 29, 1864, Mention of Dwight and Julian
Wescoat comes in May, 1864. Conscription,

troop movements, natural history, casualties,
and "poor white" squatters in the "pinelands®
are followed by a description of Charleston
Harbor on June 7, 1864. The report of the
wounding of Julius Wescoat in Va. comes on

 
Wescoat, Artha Brailsford 11
June 15, 1864. The fight on July 3, 1864,

at Fort Sland, and the Federa
at Fort Jonnag me ameeg sland, is again made
of the use of Negro troops by the U.S. Army

in July, 1864. Fights and rumors from battles
continue , as Dwight, Julian, and Dave Wes-

 

coab, all i111 or wounded, came to "California"
in the summer of 1864, The diary ends abruptl

Charleston, S.C. 1 PEt ee

On Sept. 8, 1863 Wescda wa rdered to
Charleston, and he was engaged in the fighting
in that vicinity until the following Feb. After

leaving Charleston he moved around in S.C., Ga.,
and Fla. until his company started to Wilming-

 

 

ton, N.0., on May 2, 1864. During the past
months he sometimes mentioned the movements of
Beauregard. He went from Wilmington to Drewry 's
Bluff, Va., where he engaged in a battle which
lasted for several days. On May 31, he set out
to join Lee's Army. y 8, the "Yankees

 
Wescoat, Joseph Julius 2
took a part of our line from Clingman's N.C,
Brigade." Near the last of Nov. he speaks of
short rations. In Jan., 1865, he wrote of the
fall of Fort Fisher, N.C. On Feb. 20, he and
his entire company were captured and confined
in Old Capitol Prison. They were soon exchang-

 

ed, and in May he was fighting in the Battle of
the Wilderness. He briefly describes the fight
ing there. On June 3, 1864 (the entries in ths
diary do not always run consecutively) he was
severady wounded in a leg at Cold Harbor. In
Mar., 1865 he was transferred to a prison at

 
Wescoat, Joseph Julius Ke)

 

Fort Deleware. After that he recorded rumors
he heard about military operations, the reac-
tion of his fellow Confederate prisoners to the
surrender of Lee; how he felt about the assass-
ination of Lincoln, and the shortsge of food in
the prison.

The regiments to which he makes reference in
his diary are: 27th and 5th Ga. Cavalry, 12th
and 29th Ga. Vols., 2nd Fla. Battery, llth $.C.
Vols., 18th S.C. Regt., and the 26th and 59th
Va. Regts.

At the end of the diary there is some geneo-

Wesley Family. Papers, 1726-1889, v.p. in
England, ae
in 1726, while a student at Lincoln College,
John Wesley writes to a brother, inclosing a
copy of two poems, He mentions receiving a
note for twelve pounds from his father, gives
his impression of the students at Lincoln, and

 

reports three local happenings of recent date.
There is a letter from John Wesley to Mrs,
Eliza Bennis, one of the first five members of
the Methodist Society in Limerick, Ireland, and
accompanying this letter is one by her grand-
daughter regarding the letter by Wesley.

 
Wesley Family 2
2 items added, 3-12-52, One of these is a
letter of Nov, 30, 1770, from John Wesley to
Joseph.Benson, He says that he has, after feel
ing for several years that it was his duty to
do so, told Lady Huntingdon that she thought
herself of more importance than she was. She

 

actively protested against the minutes of
Wesley's conference that were published in 17%,
He also writes about the large congregations at
the Tabernacle and Tottenham Court Chapel,

 
Wesley Family 5
probably for his funeral sermon on George
Whitefield, who had died on Sept 30, and mentias
the disposal of those two houses and others
where Whitefield had preached. The other item
is a dealer's advertisement of this Wesley
letter,

 

2 items added, 11-6-54: Copies,neither of
which is an original, of a letter written by
Charles Wesley (1707-1788)to Dr, Chandler in
1785, It was later published in the New York
Gazette, and is largely autobiographical. He
traces his educational career. He says that his

 
Wesley Family 4
brother John persuaded him to become ordained
and to accompany him and James Oglethorpe to
Georgia. When they reached that colony in 1736,
John took charge of mission work at Savannah
and he at Frederica. While he was waiting for
an opportunity to preach to the Indians he

 

served as secretary to Oglethorpe and also sec-
retary of Indian Affairs, I11 health resulting
from exposure forced him back to England within
six months. John returned the next year. He
describes the work in the Methodist Society
which he had founded while a student at Christ

 
Wesley Family 5
College. He tells how he and John labored for
fifty years to prevent that society from break-
ing with the Church of England, and expresses
the deepest regret that John finally assumed,
without authority from the Church, the "Epi s—
copal Character" and ordained elders and con-

 

secrated a bishop whom he sent to America to
ordain lay preachers. He is convinced that in
doing this John has unintentionally dissolved
his connection with the Church, He goes on to
say that the Methodists in America, no more than
those in England, want to be separated from the

 
Wesley Family 6
Church, He feels that those in America are just
more Presbyterians and will eventually come to
nothing as a religious group.

2 items added, 6-3-57: Copies of letters
from John Wesley to Thomas McGeary which concern
human pride and the search for a schoolmaster

 

for Kingswood School, The originals of these
letters were deposited in 1957 by Mrs, C, A,
Stonehill, Sole Farm House, Great Bookham,
Surrey, Eng., at the Kingswood School, Bath,
Eng.

1788, concerning the appointment of Methodist
clergymen.

1 vol. added, 8-2-68: An inventory of the
printed works owned by John Wesley at the
time of his death in 1791. The listings begin

in 1791 when these works and Wesley's copyrights
were transferred from the trustees of Wesley's
estate to George Whitfield, who was selected

to represent the Methodist conference, the
benificiary of this portion of the estate.

 
Wesley Family 8

A copy of the deed of transference is contained
in pages 1-3 of the volume and a copy of
Whitfield's receipt on pages 41-42. Listings
after 1791 were made annually from 1805 through
1816,with the execption of 1806. The monetary
value assigned to each entry provides infor-
mation on the cost of books in the late

 

eithteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

The sum designated in the receipt appears

to have been written in pencil by someone other
than the writer of this copy; the figure given
here is 4,906 pounds, 9 shillings, 5 pence.

 
Wesley Family 9
12 items added, 9-29-69: Ten Xerox copies of
sermons written and delivered by Charles Wesley,
1735-1738, and a letter written by John Wesley
with a poem about him. Many of the sermons
were preached during a visit to the American
colonies. The original manuscripts are housed
in the Methodist Archives in London.

 

The letter, dated August 4, 1777, was ad-
dressed by John Wesley to Walter Churchey, a
Methodist layman and an attorney in Brecon.

It reveals the close relationship which existed

 
Wesley Family 10
between the two men. Glued to the same sheet
of paper on which the letter is mounted is a
poem written on May 22, 1819, It concerns the
receipt of a picture of Wesley on a piece of
glass from the windows of his coach.

1 item added, 11-13-69: A letter from John
Wesley to Joseph Benson, September 17, 1788.
Wesley commented on the futility of trying to
interpret by reason what is known only by reve-
lation. He criticized the theological writings
of John William Fletcher and Isaac Watts for

their rationalistic approach,

1 item added, 12-1-69: A letter from John
Wesley to Samuel Bradburn, March 13, 1788,
concerning Charles Wesley's illness.

2 items added, 7-10-70: A letter from John
Wesley (April, 1789) and an affidavit endorsed
by him (July 29, 1782). The following comments
are included in a memorandum from Dr. Frank
Baker, a member of the faculty of the Divinity
School of Duke University. This memorandum is
attached to the pertinent accession record

 

 
Wesley Family 12

 

among the files of the Manuscript Department.
“Although slightly imperfect, this letter is
indeed unpublished and previously unknown to
me, It promises to be of some importance,
Kenton is apparently James Kenton, an old
friend of the Wesley family, author of printed
"Scripture Cards,' and of Elegies on both the
Wesley brothers, and a witness at young Samuel
Wesley's wedding. Wesley is apparently writing
to some governor of his old school of The
Charterhouse, which also, as a Carthusian

 
Wesley Family 13

 

foundation, ran some almshouses for needy
brethren, whom Wesley sometimes visited. Wesle
seems to be seeking such charity for Kenton
himself,"

"This document [the affidavit] is indeed a
very important one relating to one of the major
chapels of British Methodism, built to seat

1000, opened by Wesley and Dr. Thomas Coke in
1783, and described by Wesley as ‘one of the
most elegant in England.': This replaced the
original Octagon chapel in Nottingham. It

 
Wesley Family 14

 

became a centre of controversy after Wesley's
death. The leader of the Methodist New Con-
nexion dissenting offshoot, Alexander Kilham
(see DNB), was buried here."

"This bond is especially important because it
illustrates the way in which at this time
Wesley and Coke were striving to pull together

under Methodist control property which had been
erected under Methodist auspices but were under
the control of local trustees. This is a

guarantee that if Methodism helps to liquidate

 
Wesley Family 15

 

the debt on the building it will in fact be
conveyed to the Connexion. It is a key.documen
in the story of British Methodism and church
property. ... I do not know of any other
such bond."

1 item added, 5-22-72: A letter from John
Wesley to Jasper Robinson, a Methodist clergy-

man (September.11,1790). Wesley inquired about
a Mr. Haddesley and commented on legal matters

at Lincolnshire and Devonshire.
7 items and 1 vol, added, 4-17-78: Letters
written by John, Charles, and Sarah Wesley and

 
Wesley Family 16

 

a volume of photographs of various places
associated with the Wesleys and the history of
Methodism in England. The letters refer to
spiritual development and other personal matters
concerning the correspondents. Ina letter of
June 19, 1751, John Wesley instructs Samuel
Lloyd in ways in which to improve the depth and
consistency of his spiritual commitment. On

July 3, 1751, he wrote to Lloyd concerning
rumors of misconduct among the students at
Kingswood School, a Methodist public school at

Bath,

This collection contains correspondence of
Sarah Wesley (1759-1828), daughter of Charlés
Wesley and niece of John Wesley. The original
manuscripts are in the Lamplough Collection, The
Methodist Church, London, England. There are
approximately twenty-nine letters from Sarah

Wesley to various friends and relatives. The
relatives are Charles Wesley, Sarah's father,
Sarah (Gwynne) Wesley, her mother, and Peter
Lievre, a second cousin. These letters are
usually several pages in length.

 
Wesley, Sarah 2
They are principally useful for information about
the personal life and attitude of Miss Wesley,
but members of her family are frequently mention-
ed. On "eb. 8, 181), she explains the background
of Charles Wesley's poem "Lines to Mrs. Hall."
and in another letter (n. d. to Henry Moore?) she
writes four pages of criticism about Robert

 

Southey's biography of John Wesley. She writes
(Oct. 25, 1826, to John Gaulter) about the dis-
covery of three hymns by John Wesley which she
believes were set to music by George Frederick
Handel and which were in the composer's hand-
writing. -+here are several poems and prayers
that were written by Sarah Wesley, and a number

 
Wesley, Sarah :
of unsigned poems and notes also appear to be in
her handwriting. A poem (12 pp), "The Elopement,"
which is signed by "S. W." may be Sarah's, but
there are dissimularities from her handwriting.
A folder encloses, several poems which she wrote
during 1775-1776.

in this collection there are more than one

 

hundred letters which are addressed mostly to
Miss Wesley. A number of items are also address-
ed to her parents and to Charles, her brother.
Among the family correspondents are Thynne H,.
Gwynne, Sarah's cousin; Elizabeth (Gwynne) Waller
a cousin (see autograph file). Other notable

 
Wesley, Sarah

correspondents are James Pettit Andrews [7],
author; John Clowes, theologian; Elizabeth
Hamiltog, author; Mary (Degge) Manners, wife of
“obert Manners, a younger son of the second Duke
of Hutland; and Martha (Baker) Swinburne, wife

of Henry Swinburne, traveller and emissary to
France in 1796 (see autograpi file). The content
of these items is usually personal. There are
also many letters of a dmiliar nature from
various friends who are apparently not prominent
persons. The letters of Martha (Baker) Swinburne
contain comments about contemporary events in

Paris which reflect information from her husband

 

 
Wesley, Sarah 5

who was in Paris to attemt an exchange of prison-

ers. There is also a copy of a letter (June 28,

1797) from Sir Sidney Smith to the President of
the Council of Five Hundred in which Smith re-

quested his release. Smith's capture delayed an
exchange of prisoners with the French.

Cedartown, Ga, 599 pieces

 

This collection is composed of the personal
and Business correspondence of Geo. W. West,
farmer and mill operator, and of his family.

The collection opens with a few scattered
deeds, receipts, and other unrelated business
papers of the West progenitors, but the first

mention of Geo, W. West occurs in the 1840 pa-
pers, There 1s, 1841, a partnership agreement
between Wm. E. West, Geo. W. West, and Thos, G,
Janes, for the establishment of a mill. Al-

though the collection contains practi cally

 
WEST -2~
no other material on this firm, scant references
seem to indicate that it wasasaw mill,

Letters from the decade of the 1850's indicat
that Geo. W. West owned somw land in Sabine Co.,
Texas, probably in conjunction with the Priors,
his wife's family. A number of letters from
this period and also from the post-Civil War

period throw light on agricultural, social,
and economic conditions in Texas.

For the late '50's and the early months of |
the Civil War the correspondence is largely

 
WESR _-3-

that of West's daughter, Josephine ("Joe") and
her friends. They reflect the social life and
customs of the time, and form a sharp contrast
with her own letters of the later war years

when wost of the West children and the slaves
"refugeed" to Troup county to keep the slaves
out of the hands of the Federal troops. Her pa-

These western photographs were formerly
filed with and probably acquired with the photo
graphs by Timothy H. O'Sullivan, John Kenna
Hillers, William Bell, and William Henry Jack-
son. Those photographs within this collection

that remain unidentified with a photographer
may or may not have been made by one of those
four photographers.

A board has six photographs mounted upon it,
on one side four pictures of Apaches and on

 
Western Photographs Collection 2:

 

the other side two pictures from Yuma, Arizona.
The photographs from Yuma are a specialty type
known as blue prints or cyanotypes. The upper
photograph was taken on the Colorado River at
Yuma. On the right bank is the Arizona Terri-
torial Prison, and on the left bank is "Indian
Hill" with a structure that may be the pump
house for the water supply of Fort Yuma which
is just out of view. The lower photograph is
of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Depot situated
at Yuma on the riverbank near the prison.

 
Western Photographs Collection 3

These photographs date from about 1872-1883.

The photographer is unknown. Information about

these scenes is filed in the Information Folder
The four photographs of Apaches were made

by Noah H. Rose (1874-1952). A large collec-

tion of 2161 of his photographs is in the

 

Western History Collections of the library at
the University of Oklahoma at Norman. Rose's
collection includes the work of other photog-
raphers, but he usually gave credit lines. The
four Apache pictures are mounted together on

one Side of the board. The picture in the
lower left corner is very similar to No. 926 in
the Rose Collection, but these four photographs
are not in the Rose Collection from which some
photographs were missing when it was acquired.
No. 926 was published in Donald E. Worcester's
The Apaches of the Southwest. Information
about these photographs and about Rose is filed
in the Information Folder.

An albumen print (7 1/4 x 9 1/4 in.) mounted

photographer was Jackson, O'Sullivan, Bell, or
Hillers, but an exact identification has not
yet been made.

The photograph entitled "Delegation of
Jicarilla Apache Indians, Visiting the Corcoran

 

Gallery of Art, April 2, 1880," is an albumen
print (8 3/4 x 11 in. mounted on a 12 x 16 in.
board). The printed caption includes the names
of the persons in the photograph. The photog-
rapher was a Mr. Rice whose visit on April 2,

Recataloged, 3-27-86

 
Westmore, Joseph. Papers. Edenton, Chowan
County, N.C.

 

Joseph Westmore was an energetic and prosper-
ous merchant during the Revolutionary War.
Mercantile account books from this period often
reflect a depression in business, but his ac-
counts record considerable activity. During

the later 1770s he was based at Edenton, N.C.,

a partner in the firm of Savage & Westmore.
References to him and to the firm in The Coloni-
al Records of North Carolina indicate that he

 

 

 

 
Westmore, Joseph
sold goods to the state of North Carolina for
supplying troops in the war. He imported goods
from France. In 1779 he applied to Gov. Caswell
for letters of marque for two armed brigs, the
Rainbeau and the Fanny.

Westmore's Journal, 1780-1784 (114 pp.), re-

 

cords his mercantile business accounts after

the dissolution of the firm of Savage & Westmore
and represents his activity as an individual
entrepreneur. The thrust of Westmore's business
was not a store but rather investments in

 
Westmore, Joseph

 

vessels and cargoes trading on the eastern
coast of the U.S., in the West Indies, to
Europe, and to Teneriffe in the Canary Islands.
In 1783 ventures to England and Scotland appear
for the first time. There were some ventures
also to Marseilles, France, Havana, Cuba, Saint

Eustatius, and Curagao. Trade with Teneriffe,
Canary Islands, was so extensive that Westmore
had a special account for it. Often he was a
partner with other men in this trade. A con-
siderable variety of goods was involved. The

 
Westmore, Joseph 4
journal entries are detailed and provide con-
Siderable information.

Another interesting aspect of Westmore's
business was that he moved around. His Journal
records his residence and visits in the follow-
ing places: Edenton, N.C., Jan. - Aug., 1780
(pp. 1-38); Suffolk, Va., Aug. - Sept., 1780

 

(p. 39); Petersburg, Va., Sept., 1780, to April,
1781 (pp. 40-48); Philadelphia, Pa., Apr. - May,
1781 (pp. 49-51); Petersburg, Va., Aug. - Oct.,
1781 (p. 52); Williamsburg, Va., Oct., 1781, to

 
Westmore, Joseph

April, 1782 (pp. 52-71); Philadelphia, May,
1782, to June, 1783 (pp. 72-84); Petersburg,
July - Aug., 1783 (pp. 85-87); Portsmouth, Va.,
Aug. - Nov., 1783 (pp. 88-91); Cape Francois
(Cape Haytien), Haiti, Dec., 1783, to Feb.,
1784 (pp. 92-97); Martha Brae, Jamaica, Mar. —
Apr., 1784 (pp. 98-99); New York City, May -

 

Oct., 1784 (pp. 100-112); and Virginia, Oct.,
1784 (p. 112).

A number of ships appear in the accounts.
Armaments for a few ships are noted, but

 
Westmore, Joseph 6

 

privateering is not otherwise readily apparent
in the accounts although Westmore had been
engaged in it. The armed Brig Jenny that ap-
pears in these accounts was formerly the Fanny,
one of the vessels for which Westmore requested
a letter of marque in 1779. The Fanny and
Rambeau, probably the Rainbeau, were listed

among successful privately owned privateers
(Lefter & Newsome's North Carolina), an indi-
cation of where Westmore got some of his
financial resources. The accounts for ships

 

 
Westmore, Joseph
record cargoes, maintenance, repairs, ownership,
names of crew members, wages of crew members
and of artisans who worked on the vessels,
captains, etc.

There are entries for the selling, hiring,
and activities of slaves who are usually listed

 

by name. In one case a slave was inoculated
(p. 75).

Numerous persons are included in the ac-
counts. John O'Connor of Philadephia is pro-
minent in the accounts. Westmore dealt with

 
Westmore, Joseph

 

numerous individuals and firms, some of them
prominent. Notable persons include Caspar
Wistar, Cullen Pollock, Hugh Williamson, etc.
Persons with substantial accounts include
Edmund Blount, Richard Curson, David Ross,
Richard Cahill, William Page, Larkin Dorsey,

and William Savage, formerly of Savage &
Westmore, etc.

In some entries notations were made about
depreciation of currency and about what currency

was being used.

 
Westmore, Joseph 9

 

The inside covers, first page, and last 48
pages were used in 1864-1865 for a limited
variety of household accounts and memoranda.
The most numerous entries are for the issuance
of cotton, wool, and cow's hair to servants
and neighbors for spinning, weaving, and
knitting cloth for domestic use. Other

notations include drawing out brandy, borrowing
money, issuing allowances to servants, pur-
chasing eggs and chickens, getting and dis-
tributing flour, setting aside wool for the

 
Westmore, Joseph 10

 

Confederate tax in kind, etc.

The writer is unidentified. The activities
are. consistent with those of a woman who was
directing a household, one to which a number of
slaves were connected. In one instance she
noted boiling a ham for the table, most surely
a woman's task at that time. These records

represent the woman's work in running a house-
hold during very trying wartime economic
circumstances,

The residence of the woman is also not given

 
Westmore, Joseph x I
in the manuscript, but she can be identified
with King and Queen County, Virginia. On
several occasions she acquired goods from
Richmond, and in one instance she personally
purchased items from a resident of Essex County.
She got flour from Reuben Garnett's mill. A
Garnett's Mill is listed for King and Queen

 

County, a county adjacent to Essex, in
Chataigne's Virginia Business Directory and
Gazetteer ... 1877-78. The mill was located at
or near New Town in the northern end of the

 

 
Westmore, Joseph

a2

 

county. A Reuben Garnett was a prominent
resident according to Alfred Bagby's King and
Queen County, Virginia, and other family names
mentioned in the manuscript can also be found
in this book and in the directory.

Weston, George Harry. Papers. Baltimore,
Baltimore County, Maryland

 

The collection contains a six-volume diary
(May, 1861 - April, 1864) written by Weston of
Baltimore while he was a soldier in the Con-
federate States Army. The first five volumes
have loose bindings, while the binding on volume

six is completely absent. Pages in each volume
are numbered, some arbitrarily, while others were
already numbered when the collection was cata-
loged. Volume four contains two different

 
Weston, George Harry Z
series of page numberings to accommodate a series
of entries that were taped into the volume.
Pages are missing fromvolumes twothrough five.
Weston celebrates his twenty-fifth birthday
on Feb. 27, 1864, shortly before the collection
concludes. The period covered includes: Weston's
career with the lst Maryland Infantry Regiment

 

(ca. May, 1861, to May 17, 1862); his service in
the 9th Georgia Battalion Artillery (ca. Jan.,
1863, to Sept., 1863); his imprisonment at Camp
Douglas, Chicago, Illinois (September 24, 1863,

 
Weston, George Harry 3

 

to April 18, 1864); and his return to Baltimore
on April 24, 1864.

The collection contains many amusing and
memorable quotes on a variety of subjects.
Different aspects of camp life are covered.
Routinely he writes about the weather, food, his
living quarters, camp duties, camp amusements

and his desire to return home. Intermittently,
he expresses concern that Maryland and therefore
Baltimore is being forced to stay in the Union,
the different aspects of life in the North and

 
Weston, George Harry

 

and the South and his desire to keep up with
news accounts from the war front.

Interspersed in the volumes are poems both
related and unrelated to the war. He also used
the diaries to list the names and ranks of per-
sons in the Maryland and Georgia regiments,
marches accomplished, inventories of clothing

and food items, camps and stopping places,
drawings of various aspects of military life and
medical prescriptions.

While Weston was with the Maryland regiment,

 
Weston, George Harry 5

 

he fought in the First Battle of Manassas (July,
1861) and he gives a graphic description of the
battle. He also vividly describes the evacu-
ation of the area once the battle was over.
While only a few glimpses are given of
Weston's superior officers, he particularly
holds "Stonewall" Jackson and Pierre Beauregard

in high esteem.

Weston was located in several areas in
Virginia while in the Maryland Regiment, in-
cluding Fairfax, Richmond, Centreville (at Camp

 
Weston, George Harry 6
Eton) and Orange Court House. After he was
marched out of service (May 17, 1862) from the
Maryland Regiment, he became a hotel clerk at
the Orange Hotel in Lynchburg, Virginia. There
are only a few entries between the discharge
date and May 1, 1863, when Weston was inBristol,
Tennessee including Knoxville, Chattanooga and

 

Cumberland Gap, where he was taken prisoner
after it fell to Union forces led by Burnside on
September 9, 1863.

Weston gives a detailed picture of the Regi-
ment's preparation to do battle at Cumberland

 
Weston, George Harry a

 

Gap, the battle itself, the surprise on the part
of the Confederate troops when Frazier sur-
rendered and the surrender ceremony.

From September 9, 1863, until April 18, 1864,
when Weston took the United States oath, he was
held prisoner. He gives detailed account of
their travel on foot and by train to Camp Doug-

las, Chicago, Illinois, where he was imprisoned.
He mentions seeing several civilians while
travelling through Kentucky on the way to Camp
Douglas who were sympathic to the South's cause.

 
Weston, George Harry 8

 

Different aspects of life at the camp are de-
scribed including health of the prisoners, the
weather, the food, the living quarters and
amusements. Except for the severe Chicago win-
ter, life as a prisoner seemed not to be any
more adverse than as a Confederate soldier.
While at Camp Douglas, he begins to receive
letters and packages from home on a regular
basis, whereas in the Confederate Army there is
no mention of his receiving mail from home.

Wetmore, Elijah. Papers, 1777-1930. Dansville,
Livingston County, New York

This collection is comprised of correspon-
dence, both personal and business, from appar-
ently related families, letters relating to
legal matters, and documents. The persons who
apvear include: Elijah Wetmore of Dansville,
NeY-; F.R. Bentley of Cheshire, N.Y.3; Roberta M.

 

Smith of Staunton, Va.; and Philip H. Powers of
Berryville, Va. The last two were married,
probably in 1851. Since the Wetmore Papers con-
tain unconnected material, with many separate

 
Wetmore, Elijah 2
individuals involved, it is impossible to relate
them properly to each other. Nor is it possible
to learn anything of significance about anyone.
We do learn that Elijah Wetmore has a dairy farm
in Dansville, N.Y., and a son, Belu Wetmore,
farms in Eigin, Illinois. Letters to the elder
Wetmore (1860's, 1870's) concern chiefly farming

 

and hunting, and a few letters reveal that Wet-

more is involved with patents. He is also agent
for W.A. Hoover and Co., Lightning Rod Co., New

Lisbon, Ohio (letters of 1871-1874).

 
Wetmore, Elijah 3

On Feb. 1, 1821, George Robertson (Kentucky
Congressman) writes to I. L. Edwards for infor-
mation. Gustavus Weems writes (April 23, 1822),
regarding the settlement of a note with the Bank
of the U.S.

Several letters, 1843-1846, are official cor-
respondence directed to the Bethel Baptist Mar-
iners Church of New York City (concerning trans-
fer of members in good standing, etc.).

Five documents in Spanish, all dated Jan. 15,
1850, relate to the Territory of New Mexico.

 

 
Wetmore, Elijah 4

A letter of March 9, 1852, to Daniel Webster
from Jonathon Meredith recommends that a Mr.
Glenn be appointed as Judge for the District of
Baltimore. On March 2, 1857, William Waterhouse
writes to President Janes Buchanan recommending
that Israel Chadbourne of Alfred, Maine, be
appointed U.S. Marshal for Maine.

 

Beginning in 1858, F.R. Bentley of Cheshire,
N.Y., writes to his daughter, Sophie, off at
boarding school in Lim@, New York. The letters,
which continue through 1861, indicate that

 
Wetmore, Elijah %
Bentley was a highly cultured man. Other letters
are written to Sophie from her mother and girl
friends.

On March 2, 1861, Col. Roswell S. Ripley (in
command of Fort Moultrie, Charleston, S.C.) re-
quisitions for funds.

A Special Order (Ne. 4) of July 15, 1861
(Headquarters, Matthias Point), accepts the res-
ignation of a lieutenant of Co. E., 40th Regt.,
Virginia Volunteers.

A Circular of May 10, 1862, ordered by Gen.

 

 
Wetmore, Elijah 6
John C. Pemberton, and signed by Francis S.
Holmes, is convied by an unidentified Southerner.
The order requires one half of work slaves
liable to war duty to appear on May 30 for a
month's assignment on the defenses around
Charleston, S.C. The copyist is a critic, who
questions the legality of the order.

 

A circular letter of July 21, 1863, from
Timothy FP. Andrews, Paymaster General, is direc-
ted to forage officers "connected with the en-

rollment."

 
Wetmore, Elijah 7

A special order of July 12, 1864, promotes
Capt. C.W. Thomas, Quartermaster of 8th Corps,
to Lieut. Colonel, by order of Gen. Edward 0.C.
Ord.

On Dec. 28, 1864, H. Webster writes concern-
ing a legal case involving Frederick E. Sickéts
(inventor of a steam steering unit for ships).
The case involves testimony by Benjamin F.
Isherwood (mechanical engineer and naval
architect).

A facsimile letter of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant

 

 
Wetmore, Elijah 8
(Jan. 4, 1865) expresses appreciation to citizens
of Baltimore who have presented Grant with a
house, lot, and furnishings. A second faesimile
(Jan. 12, 1866) to George H. Stuart, lauds the
work of the Christian Commission during the war.

The majority of letters through the 1860's
and '70's are the personal correspondence of

 

Elijah Wetmore, Philip H. Powers, and others.

Massachusetts

 

W. H. Wheeler enlisted on April 29, 1861, in
Company C, the Union Guard, of the 16th Massa-
chusetts Volunteers, which was the Middlesex
County Regiment. Many years later he wrote a
reminiscence of the Civil War experiences of

his company and regiment, as he was evidently
one of the five surviving officers of the ori-
ginal organization left at the end of the war.
The 16th Massachusetts went out of existence

 
Wheeler, W, H, 2
on July 11, 1864, with its remaining men conso-
lidated with the llth Massachusetts. Serving in
the lines before Petersburg, Wheeler at this
time evidently took command of Company F, llth
Massachusetts Volunteers.

The reminiscence is brief. After a slow
mobilization, the 16th began its fighting career

 

on the Peninsula in June, 1862, and continued
to fight in every major and most minor battles
of the Army of the Potomac until the end of
hostilities, The single exception is the

 
Wheeler, W. H. a

 

Battle of Antietam, which is not mentioned in
the narrative.

Wheeler claimed that the shot which killed
General Thomas Jonathan Jackson was fired by a
Union soldier, rather than from a southern gun,
at Chancellorsville.

In the Peach Orchard at Gettysburg, the 16th
fought against Longstreet's troops, witnessing
the great bravery of the lst Minnesota Volun-
teers.

John J. Wherry (d. 1876) was the son of
William T. Wherry and the grandson of William
Wherry, Sr. John married Jane E. Smith, and
they had at least five children, Tabitha,

Augusta, George S., Harry S., and John M. The

Tennessee. His wife and children remained
there after he was appointed Inspector of
Tobacco for New Orleans in 1844, Two years
later he was. appointed a member of the New
Orleans and Lafayette Board of Tobacco Inspec-
tors. He also was on the Board of Trustees of
the Hendersonville Presbyterian Church.

The correspondence for the 1830's through
the 1850's includes many letters to John from
friends and businessmen in Tennessee, relating
to tobacco sales, his business affairs and

 
Wherry, John J. 3
property, and the Presbyterian Church in
Hendersonville. There is a series of letters
from a relative in severe financial difficulty.
In 1846, letters pertain to further business
matters and brief mention is made of men
volunteering for service in the Mexican War
from Tennessee. Correspondence during May

 

through December, 1861, is from John M, Wherry
while he was serving with the First Tennessee
Regiment. In the letters, written from
Tennessee and Virginia, no mention is made of

 
Wherry, John J. 4
any battles. Wherry was eventually killed,
though, at the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky,
om October 8, 1862. Several letters in the
1880's concern John J. Wherry's claim filed
before the Commissioners of Claims in Washing-
ton. He wished to be compensated for hay, corn,
and cattle that were allegedly confiscated by
Union troops during the Civil War.

The miscellany includes a subscription paper
for the Hendersonville Presbyterian Church and
three invitations for Augusta Wherry. A bill

 

 
Wherry, John J. . 5
of sale for slaves, will, deeds, and insurance
policies comprise the legal papers. Oversize
items in the picture cabinet are documents,
1844-1847, appointing Wherry as Inspector of
Tobacco and to the Board of Inspectors. Num-
bered among the financial papers are bills and
receipts for the Wherry family, promissory
notes, and some records of cotton sales.

This collection consists of one letter of
Nov. 9, 1839, from Hugh Lawson White, U. 3S.
Sen. from Tenn, to Ephraim Hubbard Foster, the
other U. S. Sen. from Tenn., discussing chiefly
the pro-Jackson Tenn. legislature's resolution

instructing the two senators how to vote, and
the course he intends to pursue. He gives his
stand on various issues. He is against the
bank, the salt tax, the increase of executive
patronage; and in favor of preemption rights

and freedom in elections. He says his political
"sins" will never be forgiven by the Loco Focos.
26 items added 2-19-60. Mainly letters to
Mrs. Anne E, Peyton White, second wife of Hugh
Lawson White (1773-1840). A number of these are
from political figures in Washington, D. C., who
contributed to her autograph collection.

A letter of 1834 is by Richard Henry Wilde, a
U. S. HKepresentative from Ga. who was better
known as the author of a poem that came to be
known as "My Life Is Like The Summer Rose." He
asks Mrs. White to show every courtesy to two of

 
White, Hugh Lawson 2

 

his friends, and mentions U. S. Representative
and Mrs. Robert Perkins Letcher of Ky.

J. G. Proud, Jr.'s letter of Feb. 6, 1838, e
closes his poem "The Blind Mother." There are
two yorne by L. S. Buckingham (Mar. 25 and 26,

by J. Page, son of John Page (1744-1808), whose
collection is in this dept. J. Page is attempt-
ing to secure autographs for Mrs. White, and
with his letter is an autograph of Philip Ig-
natius Barziza (1796-d. after 1858), who has an

 
White, Hugh Lawson 4

 

interesting history. When he arrived in America,
Barziza was a Viscount of Venice, a title he
lost when he renounced his Venetian citizenship.
He also changed his first two names from Filippo
Ignacio to Philip Ignatius. His father was Vis-
count Antonio Barziza of Venice, who married
Lucy Paradise (1771-1800) in 1787. She was the

daughter of John Paradise (1743-1795) and Lucy
(Ludwell) (1751-1814). See A. B. Shepperson,
John Paradise and Lucy Ludwell (1942), p. 456.
She was a relative of John Page (1744-1808) and
the Lees. Paradise, a Greek by birth, became

 

 
White, Hugh Lawson 5

 

the friend of Thomas Jefferson, John Page, Sir
William Jones (1746-1794), and Dr. Samuel John-
son. He is noticed in the lives of the last two
by Lord Teignmouth and James Boswell, respec-
tively. P. I. Barziza became the Keeper of the
Va. Lunatic Hospital, in Williamsburg, the first
state hospital, exclusively for mental patients.

See D. A. H, III, 125.

J. Page affirms that he is going to procure
the signatures of John Tyler, Judge A. P. Upshur
former President and Mrs. James Madison, and the
professors in the College of William and Mary.

 
White, Hugh Lawson 6

 

John Sergeant (1779-1852) writes on June 12,
1838, contributing his autograph to Mrs. White's
album. Miss Joanna Baillie, he relates, made a
purse with her own fair hands and presented it
to Sir Walter Scott. Her niece gracefully en-
closed in it an antique coin, valuable for itt}
age. Thereupon, Scott devoted the purse exclu-
Sively to the storage of precious relics.

Henry A. Wise writes on July 8, enclosing a
Signature of the late. former President James
Madison, whom he praises, along with the Whites.
He tells an anecdote about King William IV of

 
White, Hugh Lawson Z

 

of Great Britain and one of his rather presump-
tious ambassadors,
