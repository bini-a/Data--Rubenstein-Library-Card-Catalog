ection from him to his mother. Two of them (Nov.

his first voyage as a midshipman on the Erie in
the West Indies. One ester (Aug. 13,1837 )

 
Page, Elizabeth 4
was written when he was engaged as a coastal
surveyor on Long Island. And three letters
(Jan. 8, 1838 and April 11 and Oct. 2, 1839) are
from Washington, D. C. where he was still en-
gaged in this work. Two of them contain within
them, letters from his wife, Benjaminia. There
is also a hymn, signed by Thomas J. Page. (For
more on the Page family see his autobiographica
manuscripts. )

The rest of the collection is concerned with
widespread family matters. The Page family was
deeply religious and bound together by strong
family ties.

James Jellis Page, a member of the famous
Page family of Virginia, was born at "Ca Ira",
Cumberland County, Virginia, in 1822, and
educated at the Theological Seminary, Fairfax
County, Virginia, after which he entered the

Episcopal ministry. His career was marked by
much wandering, and there are some gaps in the
record, His first church was in Brownsville,
Pennsylvania. In 1860 he resigned from a

 
Page, James Jellis 2

 

church in Pennsylvania because his sympathies
for the Southern cause brought him into con-
flicts with the Congregation. He had a church
in Portsmouth, Ohio, in 1876, but soon after in
1877 or 1878, “he accepted one in Tyler, Tex
Somewhat later he moved to a position at a
church in Wickliffe Parish, Clarke County,

Virginia, where he remained for several years,
His last church was the Holy Trinity Church in
Collington, Maryland. He died in Washington,

The Page collection contains 15 letters, 10
clippings, one volume, and two miscellaneous
items, There are eleven letters written be-
tween the years 1852 and 1925, most of them
dealing with purely family matters, Three of

them are of some interest. One is a copy of a

letter of March 21, 1852, which was written by
Eleanor (Nellie) Parke Lewis, the adopted
daughter of George Washington, and it contains
some observations and incidents concerning
Washington and his family. There are also two

 
Page, James Jellis 4
letters (March 16 and 17, 1879) to Page from his
cousin the Reverend Richard Channing Moore Page.
The collection in addition has four letters
written during 1972-73 by Page's granddaughter,
Virginia N. Page, to the Manuscript Department.
The letter of July 7, 1973, has attached to it

a typescript of the above-mentioned letter of

 

March 21, 1852, concerning the Washingtons.
There is also a six-page typescript of recollec-
tions, mostly of a personal and family nature,
by Page's daughter, entitled "Record of Mary

 
Page, James Jellis 5

Wallace Page," and a statement from 1849 ordain-
ing Page as a-deacon in the Episcopal Church,
The volume is R. C. M. Page's Genealogy of the
Page Family of Virginia (1893), and it contains
a note on page one signed by Thomas Nelson Page.
The ten clippings concern family history, with

 

emphasis on John Page, founder of the family,
and including an account of Rosewell, the Page
family home in Virginia.

John Page(1743 0.s.-1808), the son of Mann
and Alice (Grymes) Page, was born at Rosewell,
educated by tutors and at William and Mary,and
spent much of his life in public service. He
served in the colonial House of Burgesses, gave
both financial and military aid to the Revolu-
tion, again sat in the Virginia Assembly, and
in 1789 went to Congress where he served until

1797.

 
Page, John. (2)

 

Page was a lifelong friend of Thomas Jeffer-
son, as well as being closely associated with
many other prominent Virginians of the time. He
had many social and intellectual interests, par-
ticularly astronomy. The Pages were large land-
owners and John Page led the life of a gentleman
farmer and large slaveholder, although his large
family of twenty children and: expensive estate
drained his resources.

These letters range Over a wide variety of

 
PAGE, John, Sketch. (3)
matters. Some deal with troop movements during
the Revolution, and supplies for the French for-
ces; others relate to legislation, while still
others refer to personal matters, particularly
Page's finances. Thirteen of the letters are e
tirely personal, being addressed by Page to his
young sons, while he was in New York to attend

 

 

Washington's inauguration in 1789, and the First
Congress. There is some description of New York
at that time. As a whéle, the letters are more
valuable for their association with the Page
family than for intrinsic worth and content.

On May 29, 1797, John Page outlined the career
of John James Beckley, Clerk of the U. S. House
of Representatives, 1789-1797; 1801-1807, and
former clerk of the Virginia House of Delegates.

Robert Newton Page (1859-1933) was born at
Cary, N. C. on Oct. 26, 1859, son of Allison
Francis and Kate (Raboteau) Page, He was

educated at Cary High School and the Bingham
(N. C.) School. On June 20, 1888 he married
Flora Shaw, From 1880 to 1900 he was a
lumberman, from 1890-1902 treasurer of the
Aberdeen and Asheboro R, R. co., and he was

also president of the > Bank and Trust

 
Page, Robert Newton Ss
o. of Southern Pines, N. ©0., president of the

Page Trust Co., and a Democratic member of

Congress from the 7th N. C. Dist. from 1903

to 1917, He refused to seek re-election to

his congressional seat because of his disa-

greement with Wilson's “war policy." In 1920

 

he ran unsuccessfully for the governorship of
N. C, After that he became president of the
Page Trust Co, He died in Oct. 1933,

The papers in this collection deal largely
with Page's resignation from Congress and his
gubernatorial race . Most of the

 
Page, Robert Newton 3
letters were written before his defeat in the
first primary in 1920 by 0. Max Gardner and
Cameron Morrison, The clippings deal ex-
clusively with that race. The printed materi-
al contains not only papers of a political
nature but also literature of the first World

 

War period urging the purchase of War Savings
Stamps. The letterbook (1916) is comprised
solely of telegrams and letters which both
oppose and applaud Page's refusal to seek
re-election to Congress because Wilson had
asked Congress to “oe. decision as to

 
Page, Robert Newton 4
whether or not American citizens should be
warned to stay off vessels of belligerent
countries, which decision he thought Wilson
should make himself.

In 1916 Page wrote to his constituents ex-
Plaining his stand and stating that the large

 

loan to England by American capitalists and
the profits of munition makers had destroyed
even the semblance of neutrality in the U.S.
The letters from his constituents begin in
1904, In 1916 some of them wrote Page to
oppose preparedness, &

 
Page, Robert Newton 5
On July 22, 1914 Page's brother, Walter
Hines,then ambassador to England, wrote from
a country house out from London which they
had rented for three months, He spoke of the
beauty of the English countryside, the strenu-
ous, both officially and socially, but inter-

 

esting life of an ambassador to England, his
approval of what that session of Congress had
done, and his close relations with the
British Foreign Office(said he had induced
the British government to keep quiet about
Mexico). .

Thomas. Jefferson Page (1808-1900) the son of
two very prominent Virginia families, was the
commander of a United States naval expedithon to
South America from 1853 to 1860; then a comman-
der in the Confederate navy; and later a planta-
tion owner in Argentina,

This autobiographical manuscript 1s divided
into three parts. The first part gives an acc-
ount of his family; of his early naval experien-
ces, and of his expedition to South America.
Part two tells of his experiences as commander

of the Confederate eo” "Stonewall" an

ironclad built in France. Page brought the ship
across the Atlantic but arrived in Havana, Cuba,
after the war had ended. Interesting material
on the Conf ederatehavy is contained in this se-
cond part of the work, The third part describes
his life as a rancher in Argentina after the war
where he also served as an advisor for the Arg-
entine navy.

The manuscript covers the first sixty .years,
and the most active portion of his life. He aid

Plementing the manuscript, that ewtidence a de-

1879. And it 1s perhaps the manuscript of the
autobiographical sketch that appeared inthe Pro-
ceedings of the U. S. Naval Institute October,
1923.

The last twenty years of Page's life were
spent in Italy. He died at Rome in 1900, leav-
ing a wife and five children. (See D.A.B.)

Thomas Nelson Page (Apr. 23, 1853-Nov. l,
1922) was born at Oakland, the Page plantation
in Hanover Co., Va., about forty miles from
Richmond. He grew up there, with strong boy-
hood memories of the Civil War and Reconstruc-
tion periods, which were later utilized in his

literary work. After education in local
schools He attended Washington College (1869-
1872), where he had some contact with Robert
E. Lee. After teaching for a short time in
Kentucky he studied (cont.)

 
P ce) Nelso ketch
law at the University of Virginia where he grad
uated in 1874,

Thereafter he settled in Richmond, Va.,wher¢
during the next ten years, he was fairly success
ful in establishing himself in the law, and par<
ticipated prominently in the social life of the
city. On July 28, 1886, he was.married to Anne

Seddon Bruce, daughter of Major domm Bruce and
Sarah Alexander Seddon, of Staunton Hill. Page
and his bride spent the summer in Europe, and
then settled down in Richmond, where Page, whil
retaining his legal practice, was turning more
attention to literature. On Dec. 22,1888,

Anne Seddon (Bruce) @* died very

suddenly. Though very youthful, she was appar
ently a woman of culture and charm, and had du
ing her brief married life made a firm place fo
herself in Richmond society. The tragedy of he
death naturally plunged Page into the deepest
grief, which was further enhanced by his sensi-
tive nature. Unfortunately, he made no attempt
to recover from this blow; on the contrary he
seemed to do all in his power to keep his grief
fresh, a situation which continued for about two
years. In the summer of 1889 Page and his youn
ger brother, Rosewell, went abroad. On their
return in Oct., Page lived in his Richmond

 

 
Th elgo | Sketch (4)

 

residence with Ellen Bruce (his wife's sister)
and her husband, James Bowen Baylor.

In 1880 Page had written his first ambitiou
short story, "Marse Chan," which in 1884 was
published in the Century Magazine, and immedia-
tely catapaulted him into prominence. By 1887
he had published "Unc' Edinburg's Drowndin! "and
"No Haid Pawn." These were sufficient to make
a demand for his appearance on lyceum programs,
where it was the fashion for authors to give
readings from their own works. Between 1889 and
1893 Page engaged extensively in this activity
which was quite reumunerative.

In the spring of 1893 Page was married to .
Florence (Lathrop) Field, widow of Henry Field.
Florence Lathrop was of a Virginia family, and
had much social grace and charm. Henry Field
was a brother of Marshall Field; consequently
his widow was possessed of a comfortable though
not a large fortune. This fact probably chang-
ed considerably the future course of Page's
life. Florence (Lathrop) Field had two daugh-
ters, Minna and Floreneg, who, at the time of
her marriage to Page, were about eight and ten
years old.

After his second marriage Page gave up his
law practice and mov T to Washington. There

 
Page e an imposing residence (1759 R
St., NW.) of thirty-two rooms, which ultimately
cost approximately $100,000. She also owned a
large summer estate at York Harbor,Maine, where
the family spent most of their summers thence-
forward. In this background of affluence, con-
fort, and social position, Page devoted himself
to literature and to civic interests. By this
time he was well established as a writer, and
his income from his writing was quite sizeable.
For short stories he received $1,000 each, and
for sketches and articles, $600. In 1903 his
royalties for his novel, Gordon Keith, amounted

 
ey 29, 000.
as a speaker, but for the most part restriesen
his activity to occasional addresses.

He gave his support to various reform move-
ments and schemes for social betterment, and for
the most part responded generously to requests
for cortributions from many sources. His chief

form of giving, however, was the education of
young and poor relatives, and the maintenance
of his old home, Oakland.

In 1895 he headed the alumni campaign to
raise funds for rebuilding the recently burned
Rotunda of the University of Virginia. In 1900
Page was elected — of the Univer-

 
1m. fe) Sketch (8)

sity of Virginia Alumni, and for some years
thereafter was quite activé in promoting the we
fare of that institution and particularly in
raising the Thomas Jefferson Memorial endowment.
In this connection Mrs. Page contributed liber-
ally, and also established the Barbour-Page
Foundation which provided for the giving of

 

three lectures CAPR Year at the University by
prominent men.

As befitted their position, the Pages trav-
elled from time to time as circumstances and in
clination permitted. In 1894 they spend the
summer in Europe; in 1900-1901 they spent the

 
Page, mas Nelso Sketch. /'\*-~"(9)
winter in Egypt; in 1904 they went td California
and in 1905-1906 they went to Europe for the
winter. — |

Mrs. Page's daughters were edugatéd at var-
ious schools in this country and pe. The
elder, Minna, was married (presumably without
her parents' consent) on January 27,1900, to
Preston Gibson, son of Senator Randall Lee Gib-
son. They had one son, Henry Field Gibson, born
cae 1909. Their marriage was later terminated,
and on July 18, 1908, Minna was married to Al-
gernon Edwyn Burnaby, an Englishman of wealth
and position, and thereafter resided at Bag-
grave Hall, Leicester @® shire.

The younger daughter, Florence Field, made |
her debut in 1902, and in 1906/0r prior thereto
Was married to Thomas P. Lindsay, teacher and
farmer, and lived at Southborough, Mass. They
had three children, two, Minna and Florence,
born prior to 1913, and one, John, born in Dec-
ember, 1916.

Page retained throughout his life his love
for the old home, Oakland, which burned in Apr.
1899, and was immediately rebuilt by him. On
Oct. 29, 1901, Page's father, Major John Page,
died. His mother, Elizabeth Burwell (Nelson)
Page, lived until Oct. 1, 1912. Page had two

and practised with moderate success for many
years in Richmond, commuting, much of the time,
by local train, the forty miles between Oakland
and Richmond. He was later a member of the
House of Delegates, and Second Auditor of the
State of Virginia, as well as an author ina
small way. Rosewell Page was married, ca. 1898,
to Ruth Nelson. They had three children: Anne
(b.1899); Rosewell (b.Aug.9,1902), and Robert
Nelson (b.Sept.,1905). Rosewell and his family
lived at Oakland first to keep in operation the
home of their parents. Thomas Nelson Page aided
Materially in financing the place,and over a
long period of years S Page sent his mother

two hundred dollars a month. In later years he
was equally generous with his brother, Rosewell.
Thomas Nelson Page had numerous farming int
erests near Oakland,where his lands were let ou
to tenants. Over a long period he sank two hun
Gred dollars a month in these farms, but never
made expenses, and kept them only as a matter of

sentiment.

Page was, naturally, a staunch Democrat, and
Was always interested in politics, though he
never participated much. He was, however, ac-
tive in Woodrow Wilson's campaign in 1912,and i
1913 was chairman of the Reception Committee fo
Wilson's inauguration@® There was much rumor

 
omas Nelso Sketc (2,4)
that Page would be appointed Ambassador to Great
Britain,a post which he undoubtedly desired, but
would not personally seek. In the end he was
made (June 6,1913) ambassador to Italy. He and
Mrs.Page sailed early in Sept.,and after various
stops reached Italy in late October,1913. The
outbreak of the World War the following year

 

gave Page's ambassadorship a greater signific-
ance than it would otherwise have attained, and
the additional work involved probably undermined
his health. He remained staunchly loyal to Wood
row Wilson, and was very successful in creating
good will and iy @® among the Italians,

both individually and a@fficially. In the

 
Nel Sketo (15)
spring and summer of 1916 he and Mrs.Page retu
ned home on leave, but were very busy with the
campaign (to which Page contributed as befitted
his rank), personal business, visits to relativ
es, and the death of Mrs.Page's brother, Bryan
Lathrop. They were back in Italy by the end of
July,1916. Page remained at his post throughout
the peace negotiations, striving in vain to get
recognition of Italy's most pressing demands.

On July 5,1919,the Pages sailed for home,s
he resigned his post. They spent the summer and
autumn at York Harbor and the winter in Santa
Barbara, Calif. , where ry returned to his lite-

 

rary labors, and wrot his volume on Italy

and the World War. He was also occupied with
giving various addresses, and worked at both
writing and speaking with a view to augmenting
his income which had fallen off decidedly with
the lapse of his literary work over a six year
period. The winter of 1920-1921 the Pages spent
on the French Riviera in consequence of Minna

 

Burnaby's severe iliness which had called them
to England in Nov.,1920. In May, 1921, they re
turned to American,and on June 6, Mrs. Page dieé
after a brief illness. During the following
winter Page, with Florence (Field) Lindsay and

her family,lived in the Washington residence,
which since 1913 had @r= occupied by the

 
elso Sketc - (17)
Italian ambassador to the U.S In 1922 Page
planned to live at Oakland, but on Nov.1,1922,
he died there suddehly.

Page's life typified what was considered to
be the best in American civilization of the per
iod preceding the World War. Throughout his 2&4:
life he kept close to his fundamental beliefs

 

and principles in conduct, culture, and religion
His home was a social and literary center, and
his wife filled perfectly tle place then held
the ideal for American women.

The collection vovers most aspects of Page's
life in quite a detailed manner. While there
is the inevitable pr® tion of trivial

 
Nelso ketch (18)
matter, yet there are many letters from persons
of prominence. Such things stand out as Bage's
friendship for John Fox, Edwin A. Alderman, and
Charles Scribner. (Page's works were published
chiefly by Charles Scribner's Sons).

Among the papers there are various addresses
and articles of Page, but none of his major lit

 

erary works. This a of the a is
disappointing. : 2

family expressing sympathy on Page's death.

Diplomatic Division (now open for research)
This file contains the record of Page's
official activities as American Ambassador to
Italy, 1914-1919. The bulk of the papers are

 

Carbon copies of Page's reports to Woodrow
Wilson, Edward Mandell House, William Jennings
Bryan, and Robert Lansing. Other important
items are the frequent intelligence reports of
Gino Speranza, the Embassy's (see next card)

 
Paze, Thomas Nelson 23
political analyst, the letters of James
Rennett Rodd, the "ritish Ambassador in Rome,
and the communications of the Embassy's Chargé

a'Affairs and First Secretary to the Ambass-
tind ‘when the latter was absent from his post.
The only significant material , which is not
included in the filé, are copies of the fre-
quent cables exchanged by the Embassy and the
State Department. In other respects the file
appears to give a full account of Page's ser-
vice.

These papers reflect the American govern-
ment's increasing interest in world affairs

 

 
Paze, Thomas Nelson 24
Guring the Wilson administrations. When Page
went to Rome, the Embassy staff was made up

of less than six persons; by the time he re-
Signed there were four times that many em-
ployed there. Scattered throughout the file
are papers relating to the manifold problems
of obtaining and managing this growing body

of personnel. The amount of paper work grew

 

with the Embassy staff. Nearly three quarter's
of the material in this file relates to the
years, 1917-19.

During 1914-15, the papers relate chiefly
to developments in “eo politics but also

 
Page, Thomas Nelson 20
touch briefly upon such diverse subjects as
America's intervention in Mexico and the
establishment of laws of warfare. After
Italy's entrance into the war there is less on
oolitics.ang, more on military campaigns in the
Balkans andathe Italian front. This subject
is emphasized until the early part of 1917.

 

With America's declaration of war Page turned
his major attention to the support of the
Italian war effort. He regretted the decision
of the Allied military chiefs to regard the
Italian front as being of secondary importance.

His letters ——— urge greater economic

 
Page, nomas Nelson 26

and military aia for Italy. These exertions
proved té@ be largely futile. At the end of
the war Page played an important role in the
peace negotiations. Shortly after the Paris
conferen¢te convened, he went to brief Wilson
on the Italian situation. Later he sent
voluminous reports to the American Peace
Commission on the Fiume question. In addition

 

to these matters there are many items through#
out the files relating to America's relations
with tne Vatican.

Walter Hines Page was born in 1855 in Cary,
N. C, He was educated at Trinity and Randolph-
Macon colleges and at The Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity. He edited the Forum and the Atlantic Mon-
thly, and after becoming a partner in the pub-
lishing firm of Doubleday, Page & Company, he

 

founded The World's Work, which he edited until
1913 when he became Ambassador to Great Britain.
He died in 1918 shortly after leaving his dip-
lomatic post.

Several letters in the collection relate to

 

 
Page, Walter Hines 2
the publication of articles in the various
journals with which Page was associated. Three
of them were written by James Whitcomb Riley.
A portion of a poem is included in Riley's
letter written on April 26, 1897.

Six of the items are copies of letters writ-
ten to Page by John Spencer Bassett and Edwin

 

Mims concerning the furor aroused by Basset's
references to Booker T. Washington in an edi-
torial in The South Atlantic Quarterly, Vol. II,
No. 4 (1903). Bassett, a professor of history

Correspondence of Yelverton Peyton Page, a
clerk of the U.S. Senate until -his death in
1863, and of two of his daughters. The earlie

letter is one of the most valuable with commente

upon the time Congress had spent on the Negro
question, criticism of John Gorham Palfrey and

Joshua Reed Giddings for their championing the
Negro, discussion of the political situation

from a Democratic point of view, and strong
criticism of Van Buren and the Free Soil Party

Senators who wrote to Page in regard to his
official duties, often to have newspapers for-
warded, were Joseph K. Barnes, Asa Biggs, Solon

A few letters refer to the Civil War. In

 

1862 the threat to Washington after Manassas is
mentioned. The draft is describéd in Washingta
the following year. On May 24, 1865, a review

of the Union Army passing through the streets of
Washington for two days is described with spec-

ial praise for Sherman's troops. The reaction
of the people in Washington to Lincoln's death
is given in the same letter,

Miscellaneous letters of 186% are mostly
school girl letters written from Patapsco In-
stitute by a daughter. Other letters in August

complain of the Washington weather. John Cook
Rives, philanthropist and founder of the Con-
gressional Globe, gives information on the es-
tablishment of the Government Printing Office
and his own philanthropy.

In 1874 Joseph K. r Surgeon-General of

The Parker family appears to have been of

of a non-religious nature. Benjamin J. Parker
Was apparently a cotton factor and merchant, and
most of the papers are accounts concerned with
his business. A. J. Parker was a minister in
the Methodist church, and administrator of his
brother's estate. In his tetiters there is some
comment on oe matters. A sister, Saly

faith and acted as “oe in that church.

Alton Brooks Parker (1852-1926), jurist and
leader in the Democratic Party, was born in
Cortland, New York. The son of John Brooks and
Harriet F, (Straton) Parker, he attended Cort-
land schools, later receiving the LL. B. degree

from Albany Law School in 1873. Parker also wa
granted several honorary degrees. His two

marriages were first to Mary L. Schoonmaker and
later to Am@lia Day Campbell.

 
Parker, Alton Brooks 2
Parker was a practicing lawyer but also spent
much of his career in public office. At various
times he was the surrogate in Ulster County,
first assistant postmaster-general, justice of
the Supreme Court of New York, a member of the
Court of Appeals, and chief justice of the Court

 

of Appeals of New York, 1898-1904,

In 1904 Parker resigned as chief justice to
become the Democratic presidential nominee. His
other service to his party included serving as
chairman of the Democratic State Committee,

 
Parker, Alton Brooks 3

 

delegate-at-large and New York member of the
platform committee at the Democratic National
Convention in 1908, as well as permanent chair-
man of the Democratic State Convention in New
York.

The one item comprising this collection is a
letter to Parker from James R. Gray, editor of
The Atlanta Journal. In it he wrote favorably
concerning Parker's presidential campaign and
described the political climate in the South.
Gray also mentioned that he was trying to

Caleb D. Parker (1801-1881) was apparently
a tobacco planter or merchant in Bedford Co.,
Va. He also served as a captain in a militia
regiment from his county.

His papers consist chiefly of family corres-

pondence and financial papers. Among the more
interesting items are letters concerning a
campaign for the Virginia House of Assembly
(Apr. 16, 1850), students! drunkeness and poor
food at Emory and Henry College and conditions

 
Parker, Caleb D. 2

in Washington Co., Va. (Nov. 4, 1855), and the
poor lot of enlisted men in the Confederate
Army (Dec. 10, 1861).

A circular of 1868 advertises Sunny Side
School in Bedford County. There is also
Kimball F. Prince's will (May 17, 1834) and a
deed (June 29, 1881).

The four small volumes include a book of
military commands used by Parker in drilling
his regiment of militia. The three remaining
' volumes are account books, one of which belonged
to F. D. Brockman, a tailor of Charlottesville,

Parker, Lizzie Nelms[?] (Smith), Papers.
Bladen Co., N.C. _

 

The papers comprising this collection are
principally letters to Lizzie Nelms[?] (Smith)
Parker from her brother William T. Smith.

They concern Smith's activities as a Confeder-
ate soldier, a teacher at the Carolina Female

College and the Anson Institute, and as a farm-
er in Anson County. These letters, like those
from other relatives and freinds, however, re-
fer mainly to personal or family matters. A
Sister, Mary Ann T. (Smith) Nelms, also appears

 
Parker, Lizzie Nelms[?] (Smith) 2
in the collection, as does a brother, Willie P.
Smith. Members of the Richardson family are
prominent, and two letters are addressed to
Lizzie's husband Charles. An invitation dated
March 22, 1858, concerns the funeral of Samuel
N. Smith, probably the father of the Smiths
included in these papers and the owner of the
estate discussed by William T. Smith.

The Civil War letters form the bulk of the
substantive value of this collection. High
prices and Union sentiment in Wilmington, N.C.
are the subjects of a letter dated May 27, 1862.

 

 
Parker, Lizzie Nelms[?] (Smith) me
The early period of Reconstruction in that city
is commented on in a letter of March 15, 1867.
William T. Smith served in the 43rd Regiment
of N.C. Troops, and his wartime letters contain
references to his unit. Other regiments men-
tioned are the 4th N.C. Cavalry and the 42nd
Mississippi. The siege of Petersburg was dis-

 

cussed on Sept. 21, 1864.

The advantages of settling in Texas were
stressed on August 9, 1869, by Samuel N.
Richardson, a friend or relative who had mi-
grated there from North Carolina after the Civil

 
Parker, Lizzie Nelms[?] (Smith) 4
War.

Mrs. Parker was related to William Alexander
Smith whose papers constitute a large collection
which is also housed in the Manuscript Department
of the Perkins Library. Information on the
Smith and Nelms families is contained in W. A.
Smith's Family Tree Book, Genealogical and

 

 

Biographical ... (Los Angeles, 1922), a copy
of which can be found in the Wilson Library at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Parks, Alexander, Jr. Papers. Martinsburg,
Berkeley Co., W. Va.

 

Alexander Parks, Jr. was born on April 22,
1847, in Baltimore, Md. In 1868, he moved to
Martinsburg, W. Va., where he engaged in the
grain, milling, and fertilizer business. Parks
married Mary Ella Nadenbousch, daughter of
John Q. A. Nadenbousch, land owner and miller
of Martinsburg. Biographical sketches of Parks
appear in the following sources: George W.
Atkinson and Alvaro F. Gibbens, Prominent Men of
West Virginia (Wheeling, W. Va., 1890),

 

 

 
Parks, Alexander, Jr. 2
pp. 944-945; and James Morton Callahan, History
of West Virginia, Old and New, and West
Virginia Biography (Chicago and New York, 1923),
II, 633-634. Some personal and business papers
of Parks are in the John Q. A. Nadenbousch
Papers in this department.

The first volume is a memorandum book kept

 

 

 

while Parks was Worshipful Master of his lodge
of Freemasons in 1875. The second is a
receipt book with a few entries that concern
a local Presbyterian church.

 
Parks, Alexander, Jr. 3

 

9 vols. added, 10-1-62: Volumes apparently
containing records from the Martinsburg
Flouring Mills, 1878-1890, which Parks had
remodeled in 1877. He also constructed the
Shenandoah Fertilizer Mills. The contents
of these volumes are appropriate for a flour
mill, and the ledger has a capital account for

Parks that begins in 1878. Among these volumes
are the ledger ( 1878-1890), four daybooks
(1878-1885), and four sales books (1870-1888).
The sales book for 1878 to 1881 contains
records that antedate Parks's ownership of the

 
Parks, Alexander, dr. 4

 

mills. Pages preceding page 175 of this volume
constitute a sales book for a mill owned by
Henry S. Hannis and Company of Philadelphia.
This mill is located at Hannisville in

Berkeley County, W. Va. A notation on the
title page indicates that Parks was a book-
keeper for the mill. The records extend from

1870 to 1872.

Hannis and Company operated distilleries.
Included in the John Q. A. Nadenbousch Papers
is a Report of the Hannis Distilling Co.,

May, 1872. Jn this report, there are

 

 
Parks, Alexander, Jr. 5
references to a flour mill that the company was
operating at Hanmnisville. In 1872, the company
opened a distillery there. Some members of the
Hannis family moved to Martinsburg where one of
them purchased the Nadenbousch Distillery. A
biographical sketch of Herbert E. Hannis (d.1906)
appears in Callahan's History of West Virginia,
III, 19. The Nadenbousch collection contains
papers for Hannis and Company.

This collection is a reminiscence (23 pp.)
entitled "Remembering" of what Durham, N.C.,
was like from about 1900 to 1918 by Mrs. Parks,
a long-time resident of the city.

Mrs. Parks calls it "The Meanderings of an

Old Lady," however, the time period she recalls
is when she was a young girl. She speaks of
specific people, commercial establishments,
recreational facilities, and municipal buildings

and recalls various streets and communities in
Durham. She tells of how the Civil War affected
Durham's economy and how she remembers seeing
men maimed by the War. She fondly remembers
men tipping their hats to both women and young
girls and said Dr. William Few was the "prince
of all hat doffers." A brief description is

given of Trinity College. A more detailed view
is given of how the tobacco industry affected
the lives of Durham's residents.

These manuscripts are autograph letters
from members of the British House of Commons.
They were apparently written in response to
inquiries from the compilers of a register
or directory. The register was mentioned, but

not identified, in two of the letters: Jan. 3,
1833, and an undated one from St. John-Mildmay.
Its identity remains obscure. Several firms

published directories during this period. The
name of the addressee has been removed from all

from Archdale to Mr. Gordon; and an undated
letter from Capt. Mathew to Mr. Galton or

Many of the letters list only the dates at
which the writers were elected from various
constituencies. However, some of the letters

Parrott, Enoch Greenleafe. Papers. Portsmouth,
Rockingham Co., N. H.

 

Enoch Greenleafe Parrott was born Nov. 27,
1815, in Portsmouth, N. H., the son of Susan
(Parker) and Enoch Greenleafe Parrott. He was
appointed midshipman Dec. 10, 1831, and lieu-
tenant Sept. 8, 1841. In the years prior to the

Civil War, he served in squadrons off the
coasts of Brazil and Africa, in the Pacific,
and in the Mediterranean. During the Mexican

War, he took part in Frémont's march from Los

 
Parrott, Enoch Greenleafe 2
Angeles to Monterrey. He also served on the
coastal survey and at the naval observatory in
Washington, D. C. In 1858 he commanded the
U. S. S. Despatch, which was on special duty
on the Florida coast.

Parrot was promoted to commander in April,
1861, and his ship, U. S. S. Perry, captured
the first Southern privateer of 22 war. As
commander of the U. S. S. Augusta, he took
part in the Battle of Port Royal, S. C., the

blockade of Charleston, S. C., and the capture

 

 
Parrott, Enoch Greenleaf 3

 

of several blockade-runners. Later ships that
he commanded were the U. S. S. Canonicus and
the U. S. S. Monadnock. Following the war,
Parrott served as commander of the receiving
ship at Boston and Portsmouth, commandant of
the naval yards in Portsmouth and Mare Island,
and finally as commander of the Asiatic Squad-
ron until his retirement in April, 1874. He
was promoted to the rank of captain, July 25,
1866, commodore, April 22, 1870, and rear

admiral, Nov. 8, 1873. After his retirement,

 
Parrott, Enoch Greenleafe 4

he returned to his home in Portsmouth where he

died after a paralytic stroke on May 10, 1879.

Additional biographical information can be

found in the Dictionary of American Biography.
Considering the active career of Parrott,

the collection is remarkably barren of any real

substance. About a third of the letters are

 

 

 

written to his sister, Susan Parker (Parrott)
Spalding, her husband, Lyman Dyer Spalding, and
their numerous offspring. Although these let-

ters contain some descriptions of places like

 
Parrott, Enoch Greenleafe 5
England and Tunisia, and some comments on poli-
tics and Parrott's naval experiences, they were
written sporadically from 1851 to 1873 and con-
tain mostly family news and information about
Portsmouth friends. The other major portion

of the correspondence consists of letters to and
from naval officials, crew members, and the Navy
Department in Washington, D. C. They are almost
entirely official and routine letters such as
orders, and they cover the period from 1851 to

1874. Parrott kept drafts of his official cor-

 

 
Parrott, Enoch Greenleafe 6
respondence, but the answers are relatively
few.

In the early 1850's, Parrott was involved
in a naval investigation, and much of the
material centers around this. He felt that his
commanding officer, Joshua Ratoon Sands, had
given him an unduly harsh punishment for a

 

negligible offense, so he protested to the Navy
Department. The naval board found in Parrott's
favor and censured Sands for his "irrascible

and quick temper" (1852, May 26).

 
Parrott, Enoch Greenleafe 7

In 1858, Parrott commanded the U. S. S.
Despatch which»was on special duty along the
Florida coast. Word had been received that an
attempt would be made to land slaves from Africa
somewhere along the Southeastern coast. The
shipment of slaves never materialized, but Par-
rott's ship and several others were kept busy
trying to find it.

In 1874, while serving as commander of the
Asiatic Squadron, Parrott suffered a physical

and nervous breakdown which necessitated his

 

 
Parrott, Enoch Greenleafe 8
retirement. The collection contains the doc#«
tor's reports, ordered by Parrott, and his or-
ders to return home.

The cdéllection also contains financial papers
(1828-1890), legal papers (1851-1880), lists of
officers from various ships that Parrott
served on, extracts from logs, ships' plans,
obituaries, and two small notebooks, one con-
taining poetry written by Parrott's brother,
James B. Parrott.

Parsons, Mason, Sketch, 1

Mason Parsons was a merchant, who also served
for a time as postmaster, deputy sheriff, cash-
ier in a bank, teacher, and temperance lecturer
He and his brother-in-law, E. Dening of Scot—
land Society, Conn., were in the mercantile
business together in Woodsboro and McKinstry(s

 

Mills, Maryland, from at least 1824 to 1835,
when Parsons sold his interest and took em-
ployment in a bank in Wahodsboro, Later he went

back into the mercantile business, but during

 
Parsons, Mason . ketch. 2

 

the depression following the panic of 1837 he
was forced out of business and reduced to

teaching school. He was also lecturing on ten-
perance at this time.

Parsons had at least four sisters, Phebe,
Asenath, Mary, and Hannah. The latter died in
1824. There is some of Phebe's correspondence
in this collection.

Mary, daughter of Geo. and Elizabeth Shank
was Parson's first wife. She died on Feb, 5,

1830. In 1833 he married Charlotte Gilbert.

 
Parsons, Mason. Sketch, 2

By his first wife he had three children, and
at least six By his second one.

For years Parsons was in ill health, and so
was his sister Phebe, who lived with him,

A letter of 1830 mentions commodity prices.
In Oct., 1844, Mason wrote that the Clay-—Polk
mania surpassed any other mania he had known

 

and said that the Whigs had elected their gu=—

C.S.A. General Mosby Monroe Parsons (1822-
1865) was a lawyer and politician who helped
raise Confederate military units in Missouri
after his work with Governor Claiborne Fox
Jackson failed to bring Missouri into the Con-

federacy. General Parsons* given names have
several versions, but these papers bear the
designation given by the Official Records of the
War of the Rebellion. He commanded the sixth
division of the Missouri State Guards and served

 

 

 
Parsons, Mosby Monroe 2
as second to its Commander-in-Chief, Sterling
Price, not receiving his (Parsons') commission
as brigadier general in the C.S.A. until Nov. 5,
1862. These papers fall into the early period
of his career.

Serving with the First Infantry, Fourth Divi-
sion, M.S.G., was Colonel John T. Hughes who

 

wrote two letters, Aug. 29 and Sept. 4, 1861, to
the editor of the Liberty (Missouri) Tribune,
Col. Robert H. Miller. These MSS. give an excel-
lent picture of the fighting in the summer of
1861. He summarizes Confederate feeling in

 
Parsons, Mosby Monroe 4
Missouri towards Union tyranny and Kansas
Jayhawkers. In particular he denounces Union
Governor Hamilton Rowan Gamble, An unusually
graphic picture of the Battle of Springfield,
Aug. 10, 1861, describes rumors, casualties, and
prisoners. Reference is made to Generals
Sterling Price, Ben McCulloh, and Franz Sigel.
The German troops referred to as Dutch are prob-
ably the First Missouri Regiment; and the "reg-
ulars," Co. B, Second U.S. Infantry, Gen. Lyon's
plains veterans. General Franz Sigel commanded
the German Fourth and Fifth Missouri Regiments.

 

 
Parsons, Mosby Monroe 4
The second letter by Hughes, Sept. 5, 1861,

from Nevada, Vernon County, Missouri, describes
the Confederate campaign against Fort Scott,
Kansas, General Price moves against Union Gen-
erals James Henry Lane and James Montgomery.
Much comment is made about the Kansas Jayhawkers.
Evidently two batteries under General M. M.

 

Parsons did most of the fighting. The Confed-
erate forces do not cross the border into Kansas,
having driven the Jayhawkers out of Missouri.
General Orders sent to General Parsons by
General Earl Van Dorn commanding the Army of the

 
Parsons, Mosby Monroe
West are dated May 10 and June 17, 1862, and
concern reorganization and staff work of his
regiments. Commanding the Department of the
West, General Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard
praises, on June 11, 1862, the military conduct
of John Bordenave Villepigue at Fort Pillow. In
command of Price's Division after May 30, 1862,
General Lewis Henry Little issued a circular on
June 17, 1862, regarding sentry duty. All these
orders concerning military organization are ad-
dressed to General Parsons.

Wilfred George Partington (1888-c.1955)
was a British author and: journalist. He
collected art, books, and manuscripts, and this
volume comes from his Anglo-Indian Collection.

The volume is entitled Necessaries for a
Writer to India, c. 1799, and Other Documents.
The table of contents and the explanatory notes
which precede the historical documents are
handwritten. These notes, signed by Partington,

include three pages of information on the

 

 

 

 
Partington, Wilfred George, 2
broadside, which is also entitled Necessaries
for a Writer to India. The broadside has a
long list of items that a writer should obtain
for his use in India. Partington assigns the
date of ca. 1799 to this document and explains
in his notes why he does so. He gave a second
copy of the broadside to Herbert Niel Randle,

 

 

 

Librarian of the India Office, who was to place
it in that depository. Randle was librarian from
1933-1949.

There is a letter (n.d., p. 15) of William
Robert Spencer (1769-1834), British poet and

 
Partington, Wilfred George. A
wit, in which he seeks assistance in obtaining
a writership for a George Bonsall. Spencer is
anxious to get this post, he writes, because a
valuable reversion to his children is dependent
upon it. The official involved in Henry Dundas,
First Viscount Melville.

Four other documents pertain to the East

 

India Company. The earliest of these is
Regulation 1X of the company in 1800 which pro-
vides for the establishment of a college at Fort
William in Bengal for the training of junior
civil servants. This regulation (8 pp.) has

 

 
Partington, Wilfred George. 4
twenty-eight articles. There is a printed reso-
lution of the company's General Court of July 6,
1809 (1 p.). In response to a hostile report
from a committee of the House of Commons the
directors tighten the regulations and qualifi-
cations for the appointment of future writers
and cadets. A four-page document has regulations

 

for the appointment of students at the East India
College who seek to become writers. It contains
a quotation from an act of Parliament that
regulates writerships, a copy of a certificate
which all candidates must complete, and a reso-

 
Partington, Wilfred George, Ea 3
lution of the Court of Directors on Aug. 9,1809,
that denies appointments to those who try to
obtain them by corruptmeans. This document is
undated, but probably comes from about 1809.

The third and fourth pages bear a watermark of
1805. The last item is the form of a petition
for nominating students (4 pp.). This

document is undated. Pages three and four have
a watermark of 1805.

The papers comprising this collection are a
miscellaneous group consisting principally of
family correspondence. The letters cover
three generations of life in Monticello, be-
ginning with John Nathaniel Partridge and his
wife. The first generation is also represent-
ed by papers of Andrew and Adaline Denham,

 

parents of Benjamin's wife Mary. These older
papers are mainly concerned with personal
matters. A letter written in April, 1832,
contains comments on politics in South Carolina
and that state's attitude toward tariff legis-

lation. A letter of April 24, 1857, to Andrew
Denham from a friend in his native Scotland
includes references to various authors as well
as to friends and family whom Denham had left
in Scotland.

Letters of the succeeding generation con-
sist of correspondence exchanged among B.W.

 

Partridge, his wife, and their family.

Benjamin enlisted in the 3rd Florida Volunteers
C.S.A. Army, in 1861, and several letters from
him in that year and the next recount his
service with his regiment along the coast of

 
Partridge, Benjamin waring. 5
south Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. His
letters of 1832 tell of his treatment and
convalescence after an attack of malaria. A
letter from his brother Henry Edward discussed
life at Wofford College (May 6, 1868). On
June 16, 1895, R.D. Rugeley wrote to tell of

a convention of Confederate veterans held at

 

Houston. He discussed the 15th Regiment of
Cavalry, the second unit in which Benjamin
Partridge served during the Civil war.

Jean Maury (Coyle) Patten was the wife of
John Dewhurst Patten, a Washington, D. C.,
attorney, and a close friend of John Burroughs,
the well-known naturalist and writer who lived
in West Park, N. Y. For information on Mrs.

Patten see Clara Barrus, The Life and Letters
of John Burroughs (Boston, 1925).
This small collection consists of personal

letters from Burroughs to Mrs. Patten, whose

 

 

 
Patten, Jean Maury (Coyle) 2
home in Washington he often visited. Burroughs
wrote about himself, his work, the health of his
wife, their travels, and their home in West Park,
N. Y. His vivid descriptions of the seasons and
the wildlife around his home were in keeping
with his interests as a naturalist. He mentioned
a visit with President Theodore Roosevelt on

 

May 13, 1906, and his friendship with Thomas
Edison (Oct. 27, 1916) and Henry Ford (Nov. 10,
1919). In a letter of March 18, 1916, he ex-
pressed great satisfaction with a portrait of

 
Patten, Jean Maury (Coyle) 3
himself painted by the Hungarian Princess
Elizabeth Lwoff-Parlaghy, a popular painter in
Europe and America and the wife of the court
painter of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Burroughs also
mentioned his relationships with Dr. Clara Bar-
rus (Oct. 20, 1916, and Nov. 10, 1919), a family
friend and his literary executor, and Dr. Frank
Baker, a Washington anatomist (Feb. 17, 1906).

Mary Elizabeth Patten, along with her two
sisters, Josephine and Helen, occupied a prom-
inent position in Washington, D. C., society
for at least thirty years. The Patten home on
Massachusetts Avenue was considered a "shrine

for the non-political world of fashion" (Mrs.
John King Van Rensselaer, The Social Ladder,
pp. 267-268). The Pattens were included in
most important society functions and were

 

 
Patten, Mary Elizabeth
acquainted with at least six Presidents of the
United States.

The collection consists of twelve diaries,
the first in 1913 and the last in 1943, and
one scrapbook. The diary entries are primarily
comments on various social functions, which
were numerous, and the people who attended then,

 

Only rarely does Miss Patten comment on topics
of national concern or international affairs,
and then only superficially. Her list of
acquaintances, however, is impressive in

 
Patten, Mary Elizabeth

 

length and in prominence.

Notables commented on in the diaries include
Mr. & Mrs. William Howard Taft; Mrs. Grover
Cleveland and her fiancée (and later husband);
Thomas Jex Preston; Elihu Root; Woodrow Wilson
and Mrs. Ellen Axson Wilson; Calvin Coolidge
and Mrs. Coolidge; Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Mrs. Roosevelts Warren G. Harding and Mrs.
Harding; James Middleton Cox; Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes; Charles G. Dawes; Charles A.
Lindbergh; Theodore Roosevelt; Alice Roosevelt
Longworth; Nicholas Longworth; Herbert Hoover;

 
Patten, Mary Elizabeth

 

and Wendell Wilkie.

The scrapbook contains clippings from vari-
ous newspapers (articles and pictures), invi-
tations, and a few letters. A letter of March
23, 1927, from the ambassador to Chile,

William Miller Collier, describes the political
situation in that country. The other letters
are of a more personal nature.

John E. Patterson was the son of Andrew 0.
Patterson, a Presbyterian clergyman. His
brother William S. Patterson died as a young
man, but another brother, James R., and sisters
Anna and Alice survived. He spent his youth

in western Pennsylwania and eastern Ohio where
his father preached. After completing medical
training, he tried unsuccessfully to establish
a practice in Pittsburgy Sewickley, and
Uniontown, Pa., and Hamilton and Cincinnati,

 
Patterson, John E, 2
Ohio. He joined the Union Army and served as a
medical officer on board the hospital ship
Nashville which was based at Columbus, Ky.

The correspondence contained in this
collection consists mainly of letters from his
family to John E, Patterson. References are
made to politics and government in Ohio, with

 

uncomplimentary remarks about Clement Laird
Vallandigham. A letter of Mar. 31, 1838, from
William A. McDowell to Andrew 0. Patterson dis-
cusses the organization of the Presbyterian
Church. Other topics d@iscussed include the

 
Patterson, John E.

funeral of Gen. Robert Latimer McCook (Aug.

19, 1862); James Pollard Espy (June 23, 1845);

and various matters pertinent to the Civil War.
Of particular interest is a small dairy kept

in 1863 by Patterson whose ship was sent to

Vicksburg to participate in the campaign there.

It contains numerous comments on the difficul-

 

ties he encountered’ in maintaining sanitary
conditions on the crowded ship and to various
other aspects of the campaing. The second
volume is his diary for the years 1859 and 1860
and covers only personal matters during his

various attempts to establish a practice,

There are 37 photographs. Thirty-five are
salt prints, 1858, of Miami University, Oxford,
Ohio (1), its faculty members (3), and students
of the Class of 1858 (31). The photograph of
P, H. Cone, possibly related to the school, also
belongs to this set. All these photographs are

labeled, the portraits all signed by the person
pictured. The prints are mounted on paper and
were formerly bound in a volume. Not all faculty
and students of 1858 are included. A roster of

 
Patterson, John E.

 

the Class of 1858 is filed in the information
folder for the photographs. The library at
Miami University has two copies of the 1858
class albums. Salt prints were the first paper
photographic prints. This process was used from
the late 1830s until the early 1860s. James
Barnes Patterson was a member of the Class of

1858. There is also an 1864 carte de visite
albumen print of Patterson.

Since Patterson's parents and sister Anna
settled in Hamilton where he had spent so much

of his own life, it has been designated as the
location for this collection.

Robert Patterson (1792-1881) served in the
War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the Civil
War. He also had interests in sugar mills in
Louisiana and in numerous cotton mills in
Pennsylvania.

On January 4, 1868, he wrote to a Mr. Wood-
ward concerning copies of orders issued during
his command in the U.S, Army during the Civil
War. Woodward evidently had asked to see these

had been turned over to Nathaniel Prentiss
Banks, his successor in the command. He noted,
however, that he would send Woodward a copy of

Rufus Lenoir Patterson was the son of
Rufus Lenoir Patterson and the grandson of
Samuel Finley Patterson, both of whom were
prominent in North Carolina politics. Their
papers are also among the collections in this

 

department. Born in Salem, N.C., in 1872,
Patterson received the bulk of his formal
education there at the Moravian Boy’s School
and the Winston graded School. His
university education was brief, one year,

 
Patterson, Rufus Lenoir. (1872-1943 2
1887-1888, at the University of North

Carolina. His introduction to the inventing
and manufacturing Side of the tobacco
industry came with his association with
William H. Kerr who had invented a machine to
manufacture bag containers for smoking

 

tobacco. Patterson’s own success began when
he completed the work begun by Kerr on a
machine to weigh, pack, stamp, and label
smoking tobacco. He started the Automatic
Packing and Labeling Co. in Durham _ to

 
Patterson. Rufus.Lenoir..(1872-1943) 3
manufacture this machine. Following this in

1898, Patterson was placed in charge of all
machinery for the American Tobacco Co. and
later became a vice-president. His other
manufacturing accomplishments were as
president of the American Machine and Foundry

 

Co., the International Cigar Machinery Co.,
and the Standard Tobacco Stemmer Co. In
addition he was director of the Durham Duplex
Razor Co., the International Corporation, and
the Industrial Machinery Co. During World

Supplies Commission. He died in 1943. His
wife was the former Margaret Morehead whom he
married in 1895.

This collection consists of Xerox copies

 

of papers dealing with the early period of
Patterson’s career. Some of the
correspondence and a copy of a legal
agreement between Julian S. Carr, Patterson,
and William H. Kerr show the connection of

 
Patterson. Rufus. Lenoir 1872-1943) 5
Patterson with Kerr and their combined
efforts to produce a machine to weigh, pack,

letters show Patterson’s continued efforts in
producing this machine and deal with such
matters as patent rights. There are also

 

letters in the collection from consulates in
France, Germany, Scotland, and England
telling of the tobacco industry in those
countries. Additional items are two personal
letters to Patterson’s wife and two newspaper

Creek, Bladen Co., and Cumberland Co., N. C.

The Patterson Papers concern three genera-
tions; Duncan, Daniel, and Duncan Patterson, and
their business activities as planters from 1744
in old Bladen County to 1859 at Cross Creek in
Cumberland County. The names of many Scottish
Highlanders are preserved in the manuscripts.

 

Daniel Patterson married a widow, Catherine (--)
Buie; and Duncan Patterson, their son, in his
turn married the daughter of John Buie (probably
Mary Buie). There are many references to the
Buie family in the collection.

 
Patterson Family 2
Duncan Patterson, planter, was already in
Bladen’Co. in 1744 when he bought land from Neil

McGill. His papers contain mostly bills, re-
ceipts, and deeds till his death in 1793. He
had two sons, Daniel and John, who lived at
Cross Creek. The wills of Duncan Patterson,
Feb. 22, 1793, Daniel Patterson, Oct. 28, 1818,
and John Buie, Oct. 9, 1825, give valuable gene-
alogical data on the two families. The slaves
named in the wills are divided among family mem-
bers. There are a number of land deeds for Bla-

 

 
Patterson Family 3
den and Cumberland counties. The names of Hec-
tor McNeill and Duncan McRae appear in the late
eighteenth century. (Cross Creek and Campbel-
ton were joined in 1778, Campbelton becoming
Fayetteville, N. ¢., in 1783).

The Patterson family papers begin in 1809
with Asenath Patterson and with John and Ann
Patterson of Stoney Point, Iredell County
(Alexander County after 1847). This large
family spread to the Spartanburg District of

South Carolina, to Marengo County, Alabama, and
to Athens, Tennessee, various members writing
back letters on crops, health, and family
events. Names included are Janet and Adonijah

Patterson and their son William J., Thomson

&

 
Patterson-Cavin Family 2

 

Patterson, ira Patterson, and Mira Patterson.
Mrs. Ann Patterson's sister, Sarah Thomson, and
the Duckworth family of Burke County, N. Ce,
and Tennessee are also correspondents.

Mira (daughter of John and Ann~?) married
William Cavin sometime after 1837. Her
brother Eleasaph (Eli) and his wife Sephia

provide a second family group. These families
wrote four groups of Civil War correspondence:
the Virgil S. Cavin letters, the William
Thomsen Patterson letters, the Barbara M.

(Patterson) and Robert F. Smith letters, and

 
Patterson-Cavin “amily 3

the S. D. Davis letters. Camp life and lack of
food concern these Confederate soldiers, all

of whom seem to be cousins. Virgil S. Cavin

of Cos G, 38th N. C. Regiment writes from
Petersburg during the siege, 1864-1865. William
Thompson Patterson and his brother Franklin C.
enlisted in Co. H, 56th N. C. Regiment on Oct.

 

10, 1862, and fought until the battle at Ware
Bottom Church on May 23, 1864, where both are
listed as wounded. Actually they were prisoners
at Point Lookout, from where William T. Patter-

son writes (n. d.) of the death of Franklin

from measles and complications.

Barbara M. Patterson, a seamstress, married
Rebert F. [T.?7] Smith of Co. H, 55 N. C.
Regiment. Their letters are frequent. By 1865
Smith is at Salisbury, N. C.

The fourth group by S. D. Davis of the
33rd N. C. is from Forsyth County. The Davis
family connection is obscure.

Other Confederate soldiers were Leonidas
G. and Quentin C. Patterson of Co. G. 38th
Begiment.

The bills and receipts are notable for
many early family names.

Three small volumes include daybooks of
John Patterson (ca. 1820) and John Hilary
Patterson (ca. 1868-1872) and an old almanac.

On April 27, 1834, Ira Patterson comments
from Marengo County, Alabama, about a political
gathering at Prairieville. At a meeting on

April 19 resolutions were passed against

papers of President James Madison, The en-
closed drafts mentioned in the first sentence
of the letter, and noted on the address page,

Boyd Ellsworth Payton (b. 1908), labor
leader, was born in Dobbin, West Virginia, the
son of a lumberman. He graduated from high
school in Oakland, Maryland, in 1926, and
subsequently took night classes in business
subjects. In 1932, he married Katherine Harvey,
and they have two children.

Payton's labor union career spanned

 
Payton, Boyd Ellsworth 2
twenty-two years, during which he served as a
local union president, Southern Director and
International Vice President of the Textile
Workers Union of America, as well as President
of the Virginia, Maryland, and District of
Columbia Industrial Union Councils. Since
1964, he has been employed by the U.S. De-

 

partment of Labor in several capacities; he has
worked in the Neighborhood Youth Corps, the
Bureau of Work and Training program, and the

 
Payton, Boyd Ellsworth 2A

 

Manpower Administration. Currently Payton is
the Deputy Regional Administrator for the

Salvation Army, the Religion and Labor Foundation of
America, and the North Carolina Human Relations Council.
He presently is a member of the Pennsylvania Prison
Society and serves on the Executive Committee of the
Commission on Correctional Facilities and Services of the
American Bar Association. Payton is the author of Celan-

ese Employees Benefit Club Plan as well as Scapegoat,
detailing his prison experiences resulting from involve-
ment in the 1959 strike in Henderson, North Carolina.

For more detailed biographical information, see Who's

 

 
Payton, Boyd Ellsworth 4
Who in Labor (New York: The Dryden Press, 1946) and a bio-
graphical sketch at the. beginning of the collection.

The material in this collection is a miscellaneous
group of items given by Payton. There are two scrapbooks
of clippings. The 1929 volume contains cuttings from
various newspapers, particularly the Charlotte Observer
and the Baltimore Sun, concerning the southern textile

 

 

 

 

strike in that year. The 1946 scrapbook contains informa-
tion on the Danville (Virginia) Citizens' Committee, a
group organized to fight inflation and high prices in
Danville.

In the folder, "Southern Clippings, Summer of 1930,"

 
Payton, Boyd Ellsworth 2}

 

are clippings mounted on paper and divided into a variety
of categories, mostly relating to the American Federation
of Labor (AFL). Some of the topics are AFL publicity,
South Carolina Federation of Labor Convention, United
Textile Workers of America Convention, communists, and

Peacock, Sir Barnes. Papers, London, England

 

Sir Barnes Peacock (1810-1890), British
judge, became a barrister of the Inner Temple in
1836 and joined the home circuit. His reputatio
was assured by his participation in the defence
of Daniel O'Connell. Appointment as Queen's
Counsel was in 1850. Two years later he became

the legal member of the Supreme Council of the
Viceroy of India. He later. served as Chief

Justice at Calcutta, 1859-1870, and as a member
of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,

1872-1890,

 
Peacock, Sir Barnes

Nineteen letters, 1856-1862, from Earl
Canning, Governor General of India, concern
various civil and military matters. There is
some Peacock family correspondence, 1877-1883,
and a few items pertaining to Sir Barnes's work
on the Privy Council.

The last two pages of a letter of 1848 were
postmarked at Penang Island on July 5. The
writer's initials, "C. R.," appear in a corner
of the outside address. He commented about
Penang, Singapore, his salary, and work on the

 

 
Peacock, Sir Barnes al
circuit. The writer was apparently Sir
Christopher Rawlinson, Recorder of Prince of
Wales Island (Penang), Singapore, and Malacca,

Notes on paper watermarked 1850 concerned
the status of the Maharani of the Punjab,
1846-1849.

Lord Chancellor Cottenham informed Peacock

 

of his appointment as Queen's Counsel on
February 27, 1850.

Governor General Canning's letters of 1856
included comment about: the temporary

 
Peacock, Sir Barnes aa
replacement of Sir James Outram, the resident
in Oudh, by Coverley Jackson; cases against Col.
Thompson (May 25) and Lieut. Gahagan (June 9);
the suspension of Act XXXI of 1855 on emigration
the case of a contractor who overcharged the
Maharaja of Jaipur for a road (Sept. 14); and
emigration to Grenada and St. Lucia (Aug. 21).
Peacock's letter (20 pp.) of June 17, 1857,
to W. Fanning was a report on the mutiny and
rebellion throughout northern India. He insis-
yet op ony the promis tciaiaed of censorship of the press

pp. 9-2 °

In 1858 Canning discussed? a legislative
matter in Bombay and the situation at Lucknow
and Rohilkhand (Feb. 7); the disposition of the
King of Delhi, the transfer of civil servants
from Bombay to the North West Provinces, one of
Peacock's sons, and the situation in Oudh
(Oct. 28).

 

In 1859 Canning wrote about: appointing
Peacock as vice president of the Legislative
Council (May 9); Peacock's temporary management
of the Home Department, other vacancies, and

 
Peacock, Sir Barnes 6
the need for a substitute for Mr. Grant (May 28);
papers prepared by Canning and General Outram

on the need for an immediate increase in the
naval defense of India (June 18); and the

mutiny of the 5th European Regiment at Berhampore
(June 22).

James Wilson, financial member of the Council

 

of India, complimented Peacock's explanation of
the income tax and of the pertinent legislative
powers (June 25, 1860).

Canning congratulated Peacock for his work on

 
Peacock, Sir Barnes
the Penal Code Bill (Oct. 7, 1860).

Hugh Rose, Commander-in Chief in India,
wrote on April 6, 1861, about the cases of two
mutineers of the 5th Bengal European Regiment.

There is a certified copy of the death and
burial certificate of Elizabeth Mary Peacock,
the wife of Sir Barnes Peacock (March 29, 1865).

The circumstances of the appointment of
Peacock's son as second in command of the Body
Guard were explained on March 4, 1862.

An exchange of letters between Peacock and
Lord Selborne on May 24-25, 1882, involved
proposed legislation on the Court of Appeal in
Britain. Peacock's pension arrangements were
also discussed,

 

Peacock was unable to work on the Judicial
Committee (letter of George Wheeler, Oct. 13,

James B. Peake was a merchant. He is Listed

in Elliott & Nye's Virginia Directory and Busi-

ness Register for 1852 (Richmond, 1832)- p. 1/0.
Two letters are from an aunt who was a school

teacher. In 1838 she was employed in the family

 

 

of Mrs. Dangerfield of "Bellefield" near Fre-
dericksburg. The aunt's letter of Aug. 26,
1846, is her explanation of a male teacher's
disciplining of Peake's children, actions that

 
Peake, James B 2
brought charges of impropriety.

Gideon Davis of Georgetown discussed prices
for his plows and noted satisfaction at the
continuation of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
(Jan. 8, 1832).

W. B. Peake of Fredericksburg reported (Mar.
2, 1843) on business conditions and family mat-
ters.

G. R. Peake wrote on Feb. 26, 1843, from
Richmond about his business affairs.

Hoover Hill, Randolph Co., N.C.

 

The John Hillard Pearce Papers center in
Randolph Co., where Tilman Pearce (b. 1789) and
his wife Polly or Mary L. (Jarrett) Pearce
lived for many years. A few of the papers,
particularly two genealogy charts, refer to

Tilman Pearce. His son, John Hillard Pearce
(bo. 1824) was probably a farmer. The family
were interested in flour mills. Not only was
there a Pearce's Mill in Randolph Co; two sons

 
Pearce, John Hillard 2

 

of Tilman Pearce, William B. and James Winbern
Pearce, went to Indiana, acquired farms, and
also were involved in flour and grist milling.
Many members of this Pearce or Pierce family
lived in Tabernacle Township in the nineteenth
century, and their names are to be found in
these papers.

James Winbern Pearce wrote to his father,
Tilman, and his brother, John Hillard, in the
1860's from Westfield, Indiana. A few family
letters reveal some of this group in Emporia,
Kansas. Evidently the son of John Hillard

 
Pearce, John Hillard 3
Pearce, Céward F. Pearce of Fullers, N.C., has
a few twentieth century papers in the collection

The center of interest in the Pearce MSS. is
in the legal papers. Land deeds for Randolph
Co. holdings begin in 1792. John Hillard
Pearce became clerk of the Board of Trustees of
Tabernacle Township in Sept., 1869, and so
served until at least 1877. His papers show
how the roads were maintained and mention a few
inconsequential school appointments.

The printed materials contain a broadside
dated July 11, 1825, printed by John B. Troy of

John W. Pearce was a surveyor, perhaps a
civil engineer. His manuscript volume (125 pp.)
has two parts: Level Book No. 1, 1862, and
lst Tennessee Book, 1866-1867.

Level Book No. 1, 1862, was begun on March

7, 1862. It records all or part of an exper-
imental survey for a railroad line connecting
the Richmond & Danville and North Carolina
railroads. The proposed new railroad was sur-
veyed from Barksdale Station on the Richmond

 
Pearce, John W,.

 

and Danville in Halifax County, Virginia,
southward to Company Shops (now Burlington) on
the North Carolina Rail Road in Alamance County.
The route ran through Caswell and Alamance
counties in North Carolina. The great interest
in such a connection was probably due to the

gap in the railroad system between Greensboro
and Danville. The Confederacy mounted a major
effort to close this gap which was done by
1864. The survey was only begun, however, in
the spring of 1862. The construction of this

 
Pearce, John W. 3

 

railroad was probably why the line surveyed by
Pearce was never built. The construction of
the connection between Greensboro and Danville
is discussed in Robert C. Black III's The
Railroads of the Confederacy.

Level Book No. 1 consists of pencilled

 

survey figures that run throughout the volume.
It is not clear whether this volume contains
the whole survey or just the first part of it.
Superimposed upon the survey records
throughout the volume is the "lst Tennessee

 
Pearce, John W. 4
Book" which presumably was also kept by Pearce.
These records are written in ink. They con-
sist of the names of subscribers to the
Christian Observer, a Presbyterian newspaper
published in Louisville, Kentucky. This news-
paper was one of some repute, it having been

 

 

published since 1813. The entries are arranged
by localities in many counties throughout
Tennessee and consist mostly of the names of
the subscribers with occasional numbers and
other notations. The subscribers include many

 
Pearce, John W,

 

clergymen and other persons of prominence.
Information about Pearce is confined to
volume. Perhaps he was the Capt. John W.
Pearce of the Confederate Niter and Mining
Service who was stationed at Jonesborough,
Tennessee, in September, 1864 (War of the
Rebellion, Series IV, Vol. 3, p. 702).

Pearson, Mrs. E. A., Papers. Talladega,
Talladega County, Alabama

 

E. A. Pearson was a physician in Talladega,
Alabama. He is noted in E. Grace Jemison's
Historic Tales of Talladega (p. 301) where it
is stated that Pearson's wife was a sister of
Alabama Chief Justice Samuel Farrow Rice.

A letter of Feb. 7 (or 4), 1845, is
addressed to Mrs. Pearson by Dr. Paul Hamilton
Lewis of Mobile who signs himself as her
brother. Consequently, Mrs. Pearson's sur-

 

 
Pearson, Mrs. E. A. 2

 

name should likely have been Lewis, assuming
Lewis used the terms brother and sister mean-
ing blood relations. Chief Justice Rice
married Amanda Pearson (Dictionary of Alabama
Biography), so perhaps she was the sister of
Dr. E. A. Pearson whose wife was a Lewis. In

 

any case, the writer, who signs only "Hamil-
ton," is definitely Dr. Lewis, because he
refers to an article of his that will appear
in the next issue of The New-Orleans Medical
Journal. His long article on yellow fever in

 

 
Pearson, Mrs. E. A. 3

 

Mobile has been found in the January and March
issues of 1845. He was the author of The
Medical History of Alabama (1847) and other
publications. His letter also concerned: his
feelings of bereavement since the death of his
wife; his work; his children; the Pearsons;
and Mrs. Samuel Farrow Rice.

Peden & Kelly was a mercantile firm at
Wilkesboro. Its Account of Produce Received,
1835-1837, has particular interest, because it
records items that were purchased from local
inhabitants and produced nearby - animal skins,

whiskey, grain, dairy products, cloth, tallow,
and many others.

The identities of the owners remain incom-
plete. Peden might have been William W. Peden

 
Peden & Kelly 2
who was a merchant at Wilkesboro in the 1840's
and the victim in a celebrated local murder

case. See Johnson J. Hayes, The Land of Wilkes

William Pedrick, son of Mary A. and Benjamin
Pedrick, served in Company K of the 115th New
York Infantry Regiment of Volunteers. fThis
collection contains his letters to his parents
and to his brother Nelson. He refers to his
infant son Francis but makes no mention of his
wife.

Pedrick's letters include comments on camp
life, Lincoln and the presidential election of

1364, copperheads in New York and elsewhere,

 
Pedrick, Benjamin, Papers. 2
and on the activities of his reg Tesst in Virgin-
ia and Florida and on the coastal islands of
South Carolina. He expressed rather uncompli-
mentary remarks about the Negro. Generals
Grant and Gillmore are also mentioned.

James H. Clark published a history of
Pedrick's unit, The Iron Hearted Hegiment:

John C. Pedrick Papers concern speculation
cotton at the end of the Civil War by Breesury
and Army agents. Mentioned are Secretary of t
Treasury S.P. Chase and his Special Supervis-
ing Agent, Wm. Proctor Mellen. Pedrick, who
lived in New York City, was formerly from Some
ville, Tenn., and hoped to join the ranks of
speculators in that state. His correspondence
with Wm.de Zeng brought letters describing

Conditions on @et. 2 and Nov. 27, 1863, F.Y.
Carlile also wrote from Memphis, Nov. 15, 1863,

 

 
Pearick, Joan CG, 2
picturing the market for northern merchandise
in Tennessee and the Lower Mississippi Valley.
Carlile spoke of Custom House and Treasury
agents engaged in cotton speculation and noted
trade conditions and regulations. William P.
Mellen is again seen as controlling much of
this lucrative trade. In March, 1864, Carlile

 

reported on Memphis business conditions and
depredations by U.S. troops at Somerville,
Tenn,

Mentioned in the Papers are U.S. Generals
Hurlbut, Steele, M.B. Buford, and J.C. Veatch.

Personal correspondence of Sir Robert Peel
(1788-1850), British statesman. Among the
correspondents are Lord Liverpool and John
Spencer, Viscount Althorp. One undated letter
with an illegible signature comments on a speech

by Peel.

Added 12-16-55. Letters of Sir Robert Peel
to the private secretary of the King, Sir Wil-
liam Knighton, concerning some important matters

awaiting the attention of King George IV. The

 
Peel 2
letters are very brief. They concern: the need
for the King's signature on certain military
commissions (July 4, 1826); General St:
John's desire for the King's sanction of a pra
?
8

 

vate undertaking in Brighton (Jan. 26, 1826
pardons needing the King's signature (Mar.

?

1826); the King's sponsorship of a society
established in Manchester for the promotion of
the fine arts (n. d.); papers needing the King's
signature, including one marked "Mill Doctor in
Divinity" (Jan. 21; 1827); reports of the re-
corder at the Old “~ and the King's need to

 
5

Peel
hold a council to receive these reports before

permitting the Bishops of Lincoln and Oxford
"to do homage" (Mar. 1, 1827); the petition of
a school for financial atd, which Peel advised
against (July 31, 1828); a letter from Mr.
Reightley (June 2, 1830).

 

1 item added 5-10-58 (Transferred from the

Three items added 9-26-60: Two letters by
Peel on Feb. 11, 1836, and Feb. 8, 1847 [7],
concern non-political subjects, the refusal to
subscribe to a volume by one Byron and a minor
purchase, respectively. On Aug. 8, 1828, Peel
refused to offer protection to one Quinn, whose

information did not seem valuable.

2 items added 3-23-61: This addition con-
Sists of two letters and three clippings. On
May 23, 1843, Peel acknowledges a letter from
from Sir Howard Douglass, Third Baronet, and on
Aug. 1, 1850, Sir Henry Goulburn makes a refer-

 
Peel ; 5
ence to the settlement of Peel's estate. The

Clippings are attached to the letter of May 23,
1843, and include an account of Peel's fatal
accident and illness, a small picture of his
birthplace, and an incomplete account of the
method for registering a death.

l item added, 7-M-81; Peel, Home Secretary,
refuses on Sept.7, 1826, to accept his corres-

M. P. for Westminster, writes on Jume 5, 1822,
to Robert Peel, Home SeGretary. Burdett notes
that Peel intends to make a motion this even-

asks permission to move first for a minor bill.

2 items added, 4-24-64. Lord Palmerston

writes to Peel on April 6, 1828, and asks
consideration of the matter that he wrote about
to the Duke. On Aug. 27, 1830, Peel thanks E.
Willmer of Liverpool for certain papers that he

the printer and newspaper owner. There are two
engravings of Peel.

36 items added, 8-13-64. Many of these items
are routine personal notes. However, several
letters merit comment. In either 1824 or 1825
Peel writes to Sir John Coxe Hippisley, acknowl-

edges the pamphlet that he sent, and denies
responsibility for the haste with which the
government is proceeding in an unspecified

matter.

On Jan. 15, 1825, Peel notifies Viscount
Strangford that his wishes relative to the new
title will be met. Strangford became Baron
Penshurst in February.

On Feb. 1, 1830, Peel writes to James Loch,
economist and member of the House of Commons.
He asks Loch's advice about statistics on

the increase in tonnage on the Bridgewater
Canal, 1820-1824.

On Dec. 9, 1834, Peel became prime minister.
A few days later on the 12th he summoned Sir

Edward Knatchbull to London to confer about the

new ministry. Knatchbull became paymaster of
the forces and a privy councillor after turning
down higher office.

On Aug. 16, 1837, Peel writes to Sir James
Emerson-Tennent and comments on Sir James's
failure to be reelected an M. P. from Belfast.
Peel also comments on the general outcome of
the parliamentary election of 1837.

On Aug. 7, 1844, Peel replied to a question
in the House of Commons about the advance of
French authority in the region of the Gabon

River in Equatorial Africa. He denied that

 
Peel, Sir Robert, Second Baronet 10
there had ever been any official British
occupancy of Gabon. On Aug. 19 Peel writes a
letter in which he elaborates on the position
that Gabon is not British territory.

Peirce, Ellen E. Papers. Villenova and Hamlet,
Chautaugua Co., New York

 

The collection contains letters primarily
from physicians Dr. Austin Peirce, of Villenova,
N.Y., and his son, Dr. William Peirce, to Ellen
"Nell" Peirce, Austin Peirce's daughter. Ellen
attended and taught at the female seminary in

Willoughby, Ohio, and also taught in Oakland,
Fayette County, Tennessee, during the period
covered by these letters. However, the exact
years she was in Ohio and Tennessee are unclear.

 
Peirce, Ellen E.

 

From the collection, one learns that for at
least part of 1851 she was in school at
Willoughby, and that in September, 1853, she was
teaching in Oakland.

While we are only able to learn about Ellen
through letters in the collection, additional
information about both Austin and his son are

available in the History of Chautaqua County by
A. W. Yong. It is learned from this work that

both were educated for the medical field in New
York. Information from the book and a dealer's

 

 
Peirce, Ellen E.
description of the collection are filed with
the collection.

Mutual acquaintances, health concerns, and
family matters are routine topics in the letters,
Ellen received advice on a variety of topics
from her father and brother. In particular,
both were concerned that she would be able to

 

obtain a teaching position appropriate to her
education and experience.

In the series of letters dating from Nov. 5,
1852, William corresponds to Ellen from

 
Peirce, Ellen E,. 4

 

Coldwater, Marshall County (now Tate County),
Mississippi. William moved to Coldwater to take
over the practice of an acquaintance, Dr. Koen,
who was retiring because of ill health. In
addition to discussing health issues and the
cost of medical care in the area surrounding
Coldwater, William also wrote about other social

concerns of the period. Among them were: the
education of whites; conditions of slaves; the
comparison of social life and customs of young
people in the South with those in Villenova,

 
Peirce, Ellen E.

 

N. Y.; and sectional differences between North
and South. These letters offer an interesting
insight by providing us with a northerner's

view of southern culture. In several letters
from that date from May 17, 1853, William writes
to Ellen of his desire to relocate, most likely

in Illinois. From information filed with the
collection, we learn that he did eventually move
to southern Illinois, where he became a state
senator and a surgeon in the Civil War.

The Rev. Arthur Harvey Thursby-Pelham (b.
1874), a clergyman of the Church of England,
took his master's degree at Merton College,
Oxford, became a deacon in 1899, and was or-
dained a priest in 1900. He was the son of
the Rev. Augustus Thursby-Pelham, longtime rec-
tor of Cound Church, Information about these
men is in the Clergy List and in Burke's Landed

 

Gentry.
The two volumes are entitled "The Murray,
1883," and The Murray, 1886." They contain

 
Pelham, Arthur Harvey Thursby- 2
manuscripts written and bound together in the
form of a monthly magazine. Included are stor-
ies, poetry, drawings, cards, etc. written or
compiled by children of the family and their
friends. The principal authors and editors
were Arthur Harvey Thursby-Pelham and his elder
brother Charles Augustus Thursby-Pelham (1871-
1886). Information on the latter brother is

in the Charterhouse Register, 1872-1931. The
volumes are primarily of interest as children's
work, However, the volume for 1886 has at
least two writings about the Charterhouse that

 

 

 
Pelham, Arthur Harvey Thursby- 3
Charles Thursby-Pelham attended (pp. 105-108,
113-120). Among the drawings in the 1883 book,
there are two skillful watercolors (pp. 331,
434), one of them being of Cound Church. The
1886 volume includes seven antique cards for
Christmas and New Years".

Pelly, Sir Lewis. Papers, 1875. London, England

 

Sir Lewis Pelly (1825-1892), Indian official,
served in a variety of military and diplomatic
positions in India and the Near East from 1841
until his retirement in 1877. He entered the
Bombay Army in 1841, became a colonel in 1871
and a lieutenant general in 1887.

In 1874-1875 Sir Lewis was a special com-
missioner for Baroda at the time of the trial
and deposition of its ruler, Malhar R&o, Gaek-
war of Baroda. This collection has a large
water-colored plan of the Commission Hall at

 
Pelly, Sir Lewis 2

 

Baroda as it was arranged for the trial. The
plan (24 x 19 in.) is entitled, "The Commission
Hall Baroda being an extension of the Canton-
ment Magistrates Court effected and superinten-
ded under the sanction of Sir Lewis Pelly,

K. C. S. I., Governor Generals Agent, Special

Commissioner and Administrator the Baroda State
by G. E. S., February, 1875." The plan is
detailed and has labels for the various features
of the hall, including the seating arrangement
of the participants in the trial.

 
Pelly, Sir Lewis fe

"G. E. Se," who is included in the title,
is Dr. George Edwin Seward who testified at the
trial. He was Surgeon-Major, Bombay Army,
Baroda Residency Surgeon and Cantonment Magis-
trate at Baroda; this information comes from
Great Britain, Parliament, House of Commons,
Sessional Papers, 1875, LVI, 758.

On the reverse side of the plan appears a
notation and the signature of Sir Lewis Pelly.

The significance of the trial is discussed i
The Cambridge Shorter History of India (1934

 

 

 

 
Pelly, Sir Lewis 4
edition), p. 3833, where the author stated that id
“was the first attempt to constitute anything
like a judicial tribunal to decide on an accusa-
tion against a ruling chief." Previously "the
decisions of the Government of India had been
taken in the secrecy of the political depart=
ment,” and the government acted "as judge and
party in the same suit."

Pelot, Lalla. Papers, 1852-196. Laurens,
Ss. C. 247 items Sketch

 

Personal correspondence of the Pelot
family (Laurens, S. C.) and friends, chiefly
for the period 1857-1878. The most important
items are: letters of James Pelot and W. H.
Sullivan recording their experiences es Con-

federate soldiers in campaigns in northern Va.
and at Edisto Island, S. C., and Kinston,

N. C., respectively; letters of Mrs. J. Ward
Motte (Aug.-Dec., 1870) describing events sur-
rounding the gubernatorial elections of Oct.,
1870, in the a Laurens and Newberry,

 
Pelot 3
S. C.; numerous, scattered references (1860-78)
of an economic nature concerning S. C. and Mo
pertaining especially to the price of land,
real estate, livestock, crops, and household
items.

There is little of great value in the let-

 

° 2

ters before 1860. Most of this early corre-
spondence consists largely of family gossip,
or relates to efforts by members of the Pelot
family to obtain teaching positions. The
Pelots, like the Mottes, were first of all
farmers and landowners: but indications of

 
Pelot 3
their participation, in a small way, in the
business of education are noticeable throughout
the letters. Included are: a record (1863)

of tuition-free scholars taught at Cross Hill
Academy, S. C.3; a report card (1884) of the
Newberry Female Academy, S. C.; a letter (1863)

 

recording James Pelot's attempt to secure a
position at the Citadel. Political matters
prior to the Civil War receive scant attention;
although an undated letter (Dec. 30) describes
abolitionist activities in Laurens and Cokes-
bury, S. C., and one ‘ea (Feb. 1, 1861) ex-

 
Pelot 4
presses southern enthusiasm for secession. In
money matters the Pelots were given to more
detail, recording such items as currency ex-
Change ratios (1860) and the value of crops
(€specially corn) and the prices of land, real
estate and foodstuffs at diverse periods in

 

both S. C. and Mo. There are several lists of
purchases of drygoods made in S. ©. during the
years after 1860. An undated letter describes
the mode and cost of travel from S. C. to
Waverly, Mo. A letter (Mar. 1, 1866) lists
the prices of farm ‘oe and livestock in

 
Pelot i)
Waverly, Mo.

The letters of James Pelot to his family
regarding his experiences in the Confed. Army
(5th Regt. S. C. Vol.) are mostly of value for

 

the period Sept. 1861-June 1862, at which later
date James reported briefly on his participatia

in the Battle of Williamsburg. The letters
pertain to the activities of Confed. and Union
troops in northern Va., in the vicinity of
Falls Church, Great Falls, and Alexandria. An
account is given (Sept. 15, 1861) of the action
taken by General “eo Evans' brigade in

 
Pelot 6
the battle of Bull Run. Mention is made of
movements of troops in the area under Generals
Longstreet. Beauregard and Evans, and of Jack-
son'é"ana Cocke's brigades. James wrote (Dec.
27, 1861) of the Battle of Dranesville, and ex-
pressed his opinion that the cause of this de-
feat for the South was the rash action of
General J. E. B. Stuart and the cowardice and
lack of discipline of his troops The letters
supply information (often camp rumor) regarding
the numerical strength of opposing armies,

tactics employed, and > and also de-

 

 
Pelot 7
tails of camp life - food, morale, discipline,
sanitary conditions, mail service, and fur-
loughs.

Five letters by W. H. Sullivan, a friend
of one of the Pelot sisters, also supply infor-
mation regarding camp life; and are good also

 

for accounts (Mar.-June, 1862) of attempts by
Confed. troops to dislodge Union forces from
Edisto Island, S. C., and for Sullivan's de-
scription (Dec. 27, 1862) of the battle of
Kinston, N. C. General Nathan Evans' part in
this latter engagement_is described and criti-

 
Pelot 8
Cized severly by Sullivan. By contrast, Sulli-
van speculates (June 29, 1862) over the ’ meaning
of General Jackson' victories at Richmond.
Military discipline "eal its influence upon
morale is also a subject of this letter.

The other letters of James Pelot, of a

 

military bearing, make mention (Aug. 25, 1863)
of details of the shelling of Charleston, S. C.
and (May 8, 1864) the devastation of coastal
plantations where before the Civil War rice

and sea-island cotton were cultivated in abund-
ance. In 1865, “~é appointed a member of

 
Pelot 9
a board for military conscription in N. ¢C.; his
bitterness over the waste involved, and his
sharp comments concerning the loyalty of the
citizens of Raleigh and members of the legis-

lature of N. C. he records in a letters, Feb.
7, 1865.

The letters emanating from S. C. during

 

the Civil War period - the most valuable of
which are undated - are filled mainly with
expressions of fear and disillusionment over
the approach of Union troops, details of pre-
parations made for this event, and of plans by

 
Pelot 10
various of the Pelots to flee S. C. for Mo.,
Texas, or Brazil. A letter (Mar. 28, 1865)
mentions the movement of troops under Conf eder-
ate Generals Wheeler, Johnson, and Young in

the vieinity of Cross Hill, s: C. Later let-
ters herald the arrival of the "Yankees! (May,

 

1865) at Laurens and describe incidents of the
behavior of the Union troops. There is one
good account (undated) of depredations in the
area by Federal troops.

For the period of Reconstruction and afte
the letters of Mrs. Motte (of Laurens and New-

 
Pelot 11
berry, S. C.) to her son Robert in Missouri
are more informative than those of the Pelots.
The Motte letters cover a wide range of topics:
the price of land, real estate and. livestock;
the behavior of the freedmen; the Union League
and military occupation (letter of Dec. 26,

 

1867); elections (including remarks regarding
Samuel Tilden, Feb. 13, 1877); the appearance

of new industry (cotton mills, etc.) in Spar-
tanburg, S. C. (July 18, 1876). Mrs. Motte
reports on the riots and fighting between Negro

PELOUZE, Henry Layfette. Letters and Papers.

Henry Layfette Pelouze, a none too literate
mechanic usually engaged in the manufacture of
fonts of type, was apparently a native of
Brooklyn, but he also traveled in numerous sec-
tions of the country in an effort to sell type.
He spent more time in Richmond, Va, than any
other place, remaining there more or less con-
tinuously from 1860 until 1883.

The letters of this collection were generally
written by Henry L. Pelouze to his wife, Jane

number written by her brother, Winfield Hanford
Tuthill and by Pelouze's sister, Harriett,
apparently the wife of Harry L. Hartshorne who,
in 1870, was Pelouze's partner in the Richmond
Branch Foundry. Various other members of the
family also wrote letters in the collection,

Henry L. Pelouze also had at least two brothers
Edward and William. The father was aldo named
Edward. and Henry Pelouze had at least three
children to reach maturity: Frank, Jennie and

Belle,

of the family then easy L's were rei award
Pelouze in 1850 (August 23) while engaged in the
business of making scales for weighing gold in
San Francisco. The three letters from Edward,Jr.
during this period give numerous and interesting
detailgsof life in San Francisco.

From 1854 until 1860 Henry L. Pelouze was

generally travelling between Brooklyn and
Cincinnati, Chicago and various places in the
middle west before going to Richmond, Va. to

potiie more or less he ts60"6 in 1860. While

and naturally he often expressed regret that
war was coming. Pelouze left Richmond some time
in 1862 and then apperently began selling
merchandize to Union soldiers following move-
ments of troops and appearing as near pay day
as possible. By 1865, May 27, he was again in

Richmond, having started his foundry business
once more. During this period his letters con-
tain interesting comments regarding the amount

of business, the_high rents and gene activi
ty in Richmond. It was during this same period

that his letters were,for a time, concerned

 
Pelouze, Henry L, : 5

letters, which had usually been written to his
wife, almost ceased and his correspondence be-
gan to reflect his political ambitions. He
entered thé race for Congress but withdrew to
become a candidate for postmaster in 1881. He
was termed a "Ring" candidate in one letter of
the collection, Pelouze was apparently unsuc-

cessfull in his political ambitions.

Pelouze claimed to have cast type for the
Richmond Examiner in April 1861 and at the same
time to be expecting orders from the Whig and
Enguirer. In one undated letter Pelouze made the

of the Magnolia Weekly in Richmond: "Mr, Smith
has given up the idea of Publidhing the Mag-
nolia I believe at least& for Some time as he
can not raise the money. he promised to make it
all right with us in regard to what Expense we
have been to but I don't beleave a word he. says
it cramp us very badly."

Almost as interesting and valuable are the
numerous letters written by Winiffeld Hanford

Tuthill while serving in the federal army.
Tuthill, considerably more literate than his

brother-in-law, wrote detailed and interesting

and St. Helena's Island, §.C.; and Fort Pulaski,
Ga. Tuthill died about July 4, 1864 at Anderson-
ville, Ga.

The collection affords an interesting insight
into the every day affairs of a northern
mechanic's family during the Civil War and
immediately afterwards. The letters show that

the family, as was characteristic of the period,
made considerable effort to get rich quick.
Moreover, these Brooklyn people were none too

in-law served in the federal army, The

This collection consists almost exclusively
of private, personal letterspassing between the
members of several successive generations of re-
lated families. During the first generation the
families of F. D. Ingersoll and Jeduthan Stevens,
residing mostly in New England, are the princi-
pal correspondents.

On April 3, 1862 John R. Pendell married
Mary Jane Stevens, who was a schoolteacher at
East Brookfield, Mass. They became the parents
of at least seven children: Carrie, Jennie,
Lina, Charles D., a i Leeman, and Lyman.

Little is known of the adult lives of the child-

ren. Leeman resided in Douglas, Arizona. Char-
les ¥. was a printer in Binghamton, N. Y. Ly-
man was editor and publisher of the Aroostook
Republican, a newspaper in Caribou, Maine.
Financially, Pendell was never a success.
After teaching for a time, he entered the Baptist
ministry. Later he worked as a book seller for
about twenty yearg,and then became an insurance
salesman. To his wife he frequently complains
of his debts, taxes, and small income. Over the
years the family lived in a number of places,
including Worcester, wy and South Worthington

 

 

 
Pendell, John R. 3
and Rochester, N. Y.

On May 5, 1861, James Pendell writes to his
brother John R. that he wanted to enlist in the
Union Army but was rejected because of deafness.

An orthodox minister, Pendell, in most of
his letters, is primarily interested in expound
ing and promulgating his conception of Biblical
piety. He constantly urges the younger men-
bers of the family to acquire a better educat-
ion than he had received and helps them in this
regard.

There are discussions of the presidential
elections of 1884 and 1888. Pendell is a staun

advocate of temperan- ce and votes the Pro-
hibition

ticket. His sons, while approving the temperance
crusade, do not think that by electing the Pro-
hibition candidate an effective panacea for all
the evils of intemperance will be achieved. But
they also seem to have very little use for the
Other major parties. For them the Democratic
party is completely"taboo," as having had Rebels
and traitors as its leaders, while many of the
supporters of the Republican party are hypocrites
praying and preaching dry on Sunday and then
voting wet on the following Tuesday.

Dudley D. Pendleton belonged to the

Pendleton of Revolutionary fame. His father
livedyin Jefferson county, Virginia( now
West ‘irginia) where Dudley D. was born. The

Pendleton family was almost untraceably
connected with the Nelsons and Pages.
Dudley D. Pendleton was a well

educated man( probably attending Washington
College in Lexington, Va.). In 1859 he began

 
Pendleton, Dudley D. Historical Sketch 2

teaching mathematics and Latin in Washington
College. Evidently he enlisted in the Confeders
ate army at the outbreak of the war. He served
for a time with the Rockbridge company but

in May 1862 he became Acting Adjutant Gen-
eral to his uncle, William Nelson Pendleton

( Brig. Gen.), and seemed to have retained

the position until the war ended. Pendleton
was a man of culture whose main interesté

were books and horses. The letters were

written chiefly to his mother, Mrsg. Hugh

William Nelson Pendleton, famous as .
an Episcopal minister and as Robert E. Lee's
chief of artillery, was inextricably

connected with the Pages and Nelson's of
Va. His father, Edmund Pendleton, Jr.( neph-
ew of Edmund Pendleton of Revolutionary
fame) , married first Jane Byrd Page by
whom he had one daughter. After her early

death he married Lucy Nelson by whom he
had eight children to reach maturity.
William Nelson Pendleton (b. Dec. 836 , 1809)
was the fifth child of this union.

The education of the future general,

William Nelson Pendleton , was begun by
his elder brother, Hugh, and was continued
at West Point which institution he

entered in 1826. He was graduated fifth in
his class June 4,1830.

 
Pendleton, William Nelson Historical (3)
Letters and Papers Sketch

 

On July 5 , 1831 he married Anzolette
Page who was a grand daughetr of Governor
John Page of Rosewell, distinguished in
the Revolutionary era. It seems that six
children were born of this union: Susan,

Lucy, Robin, Alexander Swift, Sandie and
Mary.

William Nelson Pendleton began army duty
September 1830 at Fort Moultrie, 8S. C.
Later, a short interval was spent at

 
Pendleton, William Nelson Sketch (4)

 

Augusta, Ga. before he was ordered to West
Point where he was assistant professor of
mathematics during 1831. He next served at
Fort Hamilton , N. Y. during 1832.

In 1832 he resigned his commission and
became professor of mathematics and

natural scienceat Bristol College in Penn.
where he remained until 1837 when Bristol
College ceased operations. Thereupon Pendle—

ton went to Newark College in Deleware
as professor of mathematics, though at

 
Pendleton, William Nelson Sketch (5)

 

that time he almost declined the offer
having previously decided to become an
Episcopal minister in Va. While at Newark
College he preached at two small churches
near the village. Bishop Meade of the Va.
Episcopal Church started an Episcopal

high school near Alexandria, Va. in 1839.

At the Bishép's request Pendleton became
headmaster of the school; he remained so
until 1844 when he opened a private school

in Baltimore and “o as rector of two

 
Pendleton, William Nelson Sketch (6)
nearby churches.

In the autumn of 1847 he became regular
rector of All Saint's Church in Frederick,
Md. Six years later he became rector of
Grace Church in Lexington, Va. Two years
after that he became agent for the American

 

Sunday School Union in addition to his
rectorship in Lexington. For two and one -
years he travelled in order to present the

Sunday School Union to the Episcopal

Church. @

 
Pendleton, William Nelson Sketch (7)
At the outbreak of the Civil War
Pendleton took charge of the Rockbridge as
Captain, later becoming colonel . By July
of 1861 in view of his superior military
training he was made Chief of Artillery

 

to General Robert E. Lee as Brigadier
General. He remained Lee's Chief of Artillery
for the duration of the war. His military
Career was so distinguished that he was
admired at home and abroad. He frequently

preached to the “eo: on Sundays ; his

 
Pendleton, William ‘elson 8

forceful sermons and pious character attracted
many to his services. After the war Gen, Pen-
dleton again became rector in Lexington, Va.
In 1875 he was enabled to go abroad through
the kindness of his admirers in the United
States and in Europe. He died in 1883 in Lex-

 

ington, Va.

Col. Abraham Penn, Sr. (1743-1801) was a
cousin of John Penn (1740 or 1741-1787 or 1788),
of N. C., signer of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, some of whose papers are in this
dept. Col. Penn was a delegate from Henry Co.
to the Va. Gen. Assembly in 1777, 1779, 1787-

1788, 1788, and 1789.

Penn, Abraham, sr. 2

 

lists an Abram Penn of Va. who appears to be
the man for whom this collection was named.
Heitman's Penn was a Capt. in the Va. Militia
Ps 1776; a Col. in 1780 and 1781; and died in
1801.

Col. Abraham Penn, Sr. seems to have been
a planter. The Penn family seems to have been
engaged largely with tobacco, in both its

azricultural and industrial aspects.

This collection consists of personal letters
and Va. land indentures, mostly relating to the

Penn family.

discussing Gen.H. F. Lee, a Confederate sol-
dier scheduled 4 be shot for desertion, and
several deserters from the 24th Regt., and one
from another regt.

Some of the later Civil War letters express

pessimism about the outcome, e. g., that of Feb.
19, 1865 by P. L. Young, which says that the Cc.
S. Peace Commissioners did nothing.

On Mar. 2, 1865 Thomas Green Penn says that

tioms are numerous. Pickett's Division, C. S.

nouncing the Radical Republican Party, the
Negro Republicans, the Custom House Republicans,

Democratic presidential candidate Horace Greeley,
and President U. S. Grant. He praises the
Democrats and the Reformers.

 

 
Penn, Green WwW. 23
There is a good letter of Nov. 18, 1874, from
New Orleans about the political life in that
turbulent city, particularly "the great insur-
rection of the Democrats." Our correspondent
denounces the Republican Gov. of La., William
Pitt Kellogg, as a usurper. The riot consisted
of fighting between the White League (anti-
Kellogg) and the Metropolitan Police (pro-

 

Kellogg). But Kellogg was restored to power
without opposition on Sept. 17 by Federal troops.
On Sept. 25, 1875, Negro teaehers in La.

A letter of April 5, 15377, discusses Father
Abram Joseph Ryan (1838-1886); Hayes’ election,
La. Gov. Francis Tillou Nicholls, and the
writer's brother, Judge John Paris Childress.
Childress is also mentioned in a letter of April
15.

Fannie A. C. [Childress?] has an undated
original poem called "The Greatest-Victory of

the War '*The Handkerchief Battle.'" It is a
satire on Gen. Nathaniel Prentiss Banks and the
U. S. Army.

Perhaps the chief value of this collection

 
Penn, Green W. ie

lies in the light shed upon the following fam-
ilies: Childress, Hairston, Kennerly, Penn,
Reamey, Redd, Rives, Saunders, Shelton, Staples,
Stovall, Sublett, Waller, Wingfield, and Zent-
meyer.

Four items, typed copies, pertain to John
Penn, signer of the Declaration of Independence
and delegate in the Continental Congress from
N. C. (1775-1780).

The first copy contains an extract of a

letter of ca. Jan. 1776 from John Adams to
John Penn. An anonymous note at the head of
this letter states that the letter was printed
in John Taylor of Caroline's An Inquiry into

 
Penn, John 2
the Principles and Policy of the Government
of the U. S. (1814). (In 1783 Taylor married
Lucy Penn, daughter of John Penn). The
Colonies, says Adams, can now elect their own
choice in government.

There are two copies of Penn's will, dated
Mar. 1, 1784. Mentioned are his son William,
his daughter Lucy (Penn) Taylor, and his son-
in-law, Col. Taylor, of "Hazlewood" plantation,
