Bandinel Family. Papers

 

The Bandinels were a family of Italian
descent who had long been settled on Jersey in
the Channel Islands, These papers represent
three generations of the family in the nine-
teenth century: James Bandinel (1783-1849),
writer on slavery and longtime clerk in the

Foreign Office; his son, the Rev. James Bandinel
(1814-1893), Anglican clergyman and author; and
the latter's son, James Julius Frederick Bandi-
nel (b. 1845), a consular official in Manchuria

 
Bandinel Family 2
who was probably a merchant there,

Two other related families are also signifi-
cantly represented in the collection. James
Bandinel (1783-1849) married Marian Eliza Hunter,
daughter of the Rev. Robert Hunter (d. 1815),
and most of the manuscripts between 1763 and
1815 belonged to this Anglican clergyman.

 

Bandinel's sister Margaret and son James
(1814-1893) married into the Le Mesurier family
of Guernsey in the Channel Islands for whom
there is a diary of 1794 and letters during the

 
Bandinel Family
first half of the nineteenth century.

The lives and careers of the two Anglican
clergymen, Robert Hunter and the younger James
Bandinel, are the subjects of a considerable
body of manuscripts. Hunter particularly had
some interesting and highly placed associations
derived either from family connections or his
clerical and educational work. Bandinel was a
High-churchman notable for his work with William
Palmer (1803-1885), theologian who was one of

the initiators of the Oxford Movement. There is

 

 
Bandinel Family 4

 

a small number of manuscripts about the elder
James Bandinel's work at the Foreign Office but
considerably more of a biographical nature, Of
rather limited use are the papers of James
Julius Frederick Bandinel in Manchuria, the
better material dating from 1887, 1894-1895,
1900, and 1904. These matters are discussed
below in more detail. Information and notes
about the families are filed in a folder at the
beginning of the collection,

James Bandinel (1783-1849) married Marian

 
Bandinel Family |
Eliza Hunter in about 1813. Before the Bandi-
nels appear in the papers with letters in 1812
and references in 1808 , the manuscripts are
those of Mrs. Bandinel's father, the Rev. Robert
Hunter (d. 1815) about whom there is a biogra-
phical notice in The Matriculation Albums of

the University of Glasgow From 1728 to 1858

 

 

 

(Glasgow, 1913), p. 70. He was the son of
James Hunter of Sanquhar, Scotland, and the
first cousin of Samuel Hunter (1769-1839),

editor of the Glasgow Herald whose career is

 

 
Bandinel Family 6

 

described in the Dictionary of National Biogra-
phy. Robert Hunter attended the University of
Glasgow where he received the degrees of M, A.
in 1766 and D. D. in 1813. He served as rector
of two parishes in Dorset: Burton Bradstock,
1777-1811, and Okeford Fitzpaine, 1811-1815.
Letters to Robert Hunter, his wife, and

 

 

children dominate the papers from 1763 to 1815.
Writers among the Hunters besides Robert
include: his wife Marian (Anderson) Hunter,
daughter of John Anderson (1718-1778), and
granddaughter of Samuel McCall, both of whom

 
Bandinel Family 7

 

were merchants at Glasgow; John Hunter (1/1lo6-
1781), Presbyterian minister at Stoneykirk,
Scotland, and his son, Samuel Hunter, the edito
and Robert's daughters, Marian (Mrs. Bandinel),
Mary, and Jemima Ormsby, and his son, George
Rivers Hunter (1796-1872) who attended Glasgow
and Oxford and who also served the parish of

Okeford Fitzpaine, 1820-1872. There are five
letters from Mrs. Hunter's brothers, John and
William Anderson, who were in India. John
Anderson was on General Eyre Coote's staff and
praised him highly in 1782.

 
Bandinel Family 8

 

Education figured prominently in the papers.
There are numerous references to the University
of Glasgow (see the subject card for specific
dates) when Hunter was a student there in the
1760's and others throughout his life. There
are a few letters from professors and students.
During the 1770's-1790's Hunter taught private
pupils, some of whom he took to the continent,
and several letters can be found from some of
them and their parents. The students included;
John Campbell of Blythswood (1774); Joseph
Digby (1786-1860), grandson of the Fifth Baron

 
Bandinel Family
Digby and later a vice admiral (pupil in 1799);
William Windham, the statesman; William Campbell
of Netherplace; Col. Douglas of Rose Hall; and
Henry Grady of The Grange, Limerick.

The Church of England is represented in Hun-
ter's career and in letters from other minis-
ters: S. Sawkins, curate at Burton Bradstock;

 

John Blair, prebendary of Westminster; and
Matthew Weddel of Cliffe, Yorkshire.

The Church of Scotland is represented during
1763-1770 by the letters of William Cuninghame,
Presbyterian minister at Sanquhar, and others.

 
 

Bandinel Famil 10
On May 10, 1782; Archibald Douglas reported

Lord Graham's opinion of appointing Henry Dundas
speaker of the House of Commons.

James Bandinel's letters of 1812 to Marian
Hunter are personal but include two references
to his clerkship at the Foreign Office
(June 2 and 1812). Several references to Lady

Arabella Hervey and her parents, the Earl and
Countess of Rosebery, indicate Bandinel's close
acquaintance with them,

One letter of 1817 and several of 1820

 
Bandinel Family ll
concern the Bandinel’s son James (1814-1893)
who would later become an Anglican priest and
author. A biographical sketch of him appears
in Frederic Boase, Modern English Biography,
IV, 256. The Queen Caroline Affair was noted
briefly in 1820. In 1828 the Directors of the
Thames Tunnel acknowledged Bandinel's assis-

 

 

tance. The manuscripts of the 1820's are limit-
ed in number.

Manuscripts of the 1830's are similarly
limited but contain some useful items. On

 
Bandinel Family 12
July 15, 1835, John Davidson, the African
explorer, discussed his forthcoming trip from
which he never returned. Young James Bandinel
attended Wadham College, Oxford, and his life
there is described in letters of 1833-1835.
Several members of the Le Mesurier family
corresponded, and they are listed in the Auto-

 

graph File. They were children or close rela-
tives of the Rev. Thomas Le Mesurier, rector of
Newton Longville and later of Haughton-le-
Skerne, who married Margaret, the eldest sister

 
Bandinel Family 13

 

of James Bandinel (1783-1849) in 1800. He was
a brother of Paul Le Mesurier, M. P. See the
description of the volumes for Thomas Le Mesu-
rier's diary of 1794. The death of his son, a
naval lieutenant, at the bombardment of Acre,
was reported on Nov. 5, 1840, A daughter,
Julia, related (Dec. 30, 1839) difficulties

between the younger and elder James Bandinel,
the latter's separation from his wife, and his
relationships with Lady Arabella Hervey and
Lady Mary Shepherd, daughters of Neil Primrose,
Third Earl of Rosebery. Henrietta Le Mesurier

 
Bandinel Family 14
described (Sept. 20, 1830) social life at Lord
Nugent's estate, Lilies, and several persons
there: the Duke of Sussex, Dr. Augustus Bozzi
Granville, and Mrs. Kemble who talked about her
actress daughter, Fanny Kemble. Mrs. Bandinel's
brother, William Anderson, was still in India

(1835 and 1838).

 

Several manuscripts of the 1840's concerned
the career of James Bandinel at the Foreign
Office. In 1842 Lord Aberdeen appointed him a

member of the commission to revise and

 
Bandinel Family * |S

 

consolidate the instructions issued to the navy
on the suppression of the slave trade. On

Nov. 23 and 28, 1843, Bandinel appealed to Lord
Aberdeen for a living for his son, and he
reviewed some of his projects at the Foreign
Office since 1837 - the Niger Expedition, the
slave trade, and other matters. Included is a

minute of Lord Glenelg, who upon retirement as
colonial secretary, discussed African affairs,
such as the proposed treaties with various
chiefs, the Niger Expedition, Guinea, and
Gambia, Late in 1845 Bandinel retired because

 
Bandinel Family 16

 

of ill health, and Lord Aberdeen acknowledged
his work and his efforts toward abolition of
the slave trade, Bandinel died on July 29,
1849, of Asiatic cholera. On Oct. 11 his son
noted that his father had served forty-seven
years at the Foreign Office.

Other papers of the 1840's concerned the
clerical career of James Bandinel (1814-1893).
His marriage to his first cousin, Julia Le
Mesurier, daughter of the Rev. Thomas Le Mesu-
rier, took place in Jan., 1845. His

 
Bandinel Family i?
appointments as deacon and priest occurred in
1840 and 1841 respectively. A number of letters
in 1848 between father and son revolve around
attempts to get a better ecclesiastical appoint-
ment for the latter. Rev. James Bandinel had
been serving at Marshwood, Dorset, under the
supervision of the Rev..William Palmer (1803-
1885), a theologian prominent in the Oxford
Movement. Bandinel's doctrinal views and his
relationships to Palmer, for whom he did writing
and to the Rev. Robert Montgomery, religious
poet, were both discussed. Bandinel applied in

 

 
Bandinel Family 18
vain for the secretaryship of The National
Society in November-December. In June, 1849,

he was appointed curate of Didcot, Berkshire.
His association with Palmer had caused difficul-
ties in getting a position in 1848.

Other letters of the 1840's concerned: the
work of the Rev. Alfred Radford Symonds,
diocesan secretary at Madras and later principal
of the college of the Society for the Propa-
gation of the Gospel (May 8, 1847); the death
of Marian (Anderson) Hunter at 91 (June, 1848);

 

 
Bandinel Family 19

 

and the views of Dr. William Stevens (1786-1868
on cholera and work on his book about the mind
and the pineal body (Oct. 27, 1848).

In the 1850's Bandinel continued to seek
ecclesiastical advancement, and there are let-
ters of recommendation from William Palmer and
Benjamin P. Symons. In 1856 he obtained the
curacy of Coggs, Oxfordshire. He continued to
write, and his works were noted by Francis
Rivington, his publisher, and others. On

Dec. 16, 1858, Rivington noted the decline of

 
Bandinel Family 20
quarterly reviews due to the newspapers. Henry
E. Napier, the historian, discussed Bandinel's
works, despots, and convents (Dec. 21, 1851).
The Rev. Alfred R. Symonds reported on the
Diocese of Madras (Nov. 22, 1854) and stated his
doctrinal views. William Palmer recommended
TT ae to the church at Crediton (Oct. 24,

53).

On Dec. 4, 1862, Bandinel was appointed to
the parish of Emly, Yorkshire. There are few
manuscripts in the 1860's,

 

 
Bandinel Family _ 21
Papers in the 1870's are more numerous. On
Oct. 28, 1879, Dean A. P. Stanley gave his
opinion of proposed legislation on the Church
of England, perhaps concerning convocation.
Mrs. Bandinel and a daughter went to Italy in
1877-1878, and one of their letters (May 12,
1878) had information on the Bandinelli family.
James Bandinel's (1814-1893) son, James Julius
Frederick (b. 1845), is the dominant figure in
the papers in the latter part of the collection.

In 1875 he married Jane Gill at Newchwang, a

 

 
Bandinel Family 22
treaty port in Manchuria, and the certificate
gave his profession as a merchant's clerk.
Documents record his appointments as vice consul
for the U. S. (1875), Germany, Sweden and Norwa
(1879), and for the Netherlands (1880).

A memorandum of Feb., 1887, describes a tour
to distribute flood relief in the region near

 

Newchwang and includes the story of the decline
of one of its ports.

The principal papers from J. J. F. Bandinel's
career are those of 1894-1895 during the

 
Bandinel Family 23

 

Chinese-Japanese War. According to a letter of
May 11, 1895, he sent copies of his reports to
the family, but only a few memoranda of events
are among these manuscripts. Apparently Bandi-
nel wrote various persons and inquired about
the conduct of Japanese troops toward noncom-
batants, A number of letters report on this
question and include references to the Chinese
troops. Many of the writers were probably
missionaries. There is a copy of two letters
from Prince Katsura of Japan.

 
Bandinel Family 24
Three letters from the summer of 1900 have
news of the situation at Newchwang during the
Boxer Rebellion. These letters and others
that year were written by Mrs. J. J. F. Bandine
Three of his letters in 1904 report on Newchwang
during the Russo-Japanese War.
A diary of 1794 (2 volumes) records travels

 

in Germany, Denmark, and Sweden: Vol. I

(301 pp.), July 17-Sept. 21, Germany and Den-
mark; Vol. II (66 pp.) Sept. 21-Oct. 9, Sweden.
The diary is unsigned. However, on pages 84-85
the writer stated that he and his brother, a

 
Bandinel Family 25

 

member of Parliament, were Pittites and that
he had known Pitt when they were lawyers to-
gether. The Rev. Thomas Le Mesurier is identi-
fied as the brother of Paul Le Mesurier
(1755-1805) in the latter's obituary in the
Gentleman's Magazine where it was also stated
that Thomas was once a lawyer. Paul Le Mesu-
rier was in the House of Commons in 1794 and
was a supporter of Pitt (Namier and Brook,

The House of Commons, 1754-1790). So the
diarist was apparently Thomas Le Mesurier whose

 

 

 
Bandinel Family 26
wife was a Bandinel and whose daughter married
the Rev. James Bandinel.

Le Mesurier traveled with a "Mr. D." who was
not identified, Their route through Germany
included: Frankfort on the Main, Hanau,

Fulda, Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar, Cassel, Brunswick,
Hanover, Celle, Harburg, Hamburg, Schonberg,

 

Lubeck, Eutin, Kiel, and Eckernférde. They
had entrée at the various courts, and he des-
cribed visits with the rulers at Gotha, Weimar,
Cassel, and Brunswick. At Brunswick he talked

 
Bandinel Family

with the Duchess about the possible marriage o
her daughter Caroline with the Prince of Wales,
later George IV, a match of which she dis-
approved but which later took place. Karl
Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, was a
noted military leader, and Karl August, Grand
Duke of Saxe-Weimar, was prominent in German

 

political and intellectual life. At Brunswick
he also met the English author Aulay Macaulay.
At Hamburg he met the author Johann Georg
Busch and commented about Gottlieb Klopstock.

 
Bandinel Family 28

e route through Denmark included: Assens,
Nyborg, Roskilde, Copenhagen, and Elsinore. He
talked with the Danish statesman, Count von
Bernstorff,

The route through Sweden included: Helsing-
borg, Lund, Kristianstad, Karlskrona, Vexio,
JonkGping, Goteborg, Trollhattan, Vesteras, and
Stockholm. Le Mesurier visited the canal under
construction at Trollhattan and the University
of Lund, and he talked with Peter Bagge,

builder of the canal, and with Professor Johan

 

 
Bandinel Family 29
Henrik Engelhart at Lund.

Another volume contains two different parts
which begin at opposite ends of the book and
have labels on the appropriate outside covers.
One part is entitled "Poetry by James Bandinel
Sen."' (1783-1849) and includes thirteen of his
poems and his translation of Spanish ballads by

 

the Marqués de Santillana. The other part is
entitled "Relating to my Father & Mother." This
part is valuable for biographical and genealogi-

cal information about the Rev. Robert Hunter
and the Hunter family and about his wife

 
Bandinel Family 30
Marian (Anderson) Hunter, the Andersons, and
her mother's family, the "McCalls. John Anderso
and Samuel McCall were wealthy merchants of
Glasgow. Other information about the Hunters
(including the Irish branch) and’ Bandinels
appears in letters of Oct. 4, 1844, and Feb, 24,
27, 1872. Also included are comments upon the

 

Rev. Hunter's students, some of whom have let-
ters in the collection: William Campbell of
Netherplace, Lord Rivers, Henry Grady, William
Windham (the statesman), John Campbell of

 
Bandinel Family 31
Blythswood, Col. Douglas of Rose Hall, and a
traveling companion, the Second Viscount Lang-
ford. Part of this information was dictated
by Marian (Anderson) Hunter, and it was written
by her daughter Marian (Hunter) Bandinel (the
references on page 32 to the other Hunter girls,
Jemima and Mary, exclude them as being the
writer).

Another volume contains copies of poetry
written by various persons, Another begins
with a sermon by the Rev. Bandinel and includes

 

 
Bandinel Family 32
more poetry and a description of Madeira in

1824-1825.

7 items added, 9-17-70: Five letters of
William Hunter, 1790-1795, a former student of
the Rev. Robert Hunter and possibly a relative,
and two letters, 1801 and 1807, of kinsman
Alexander Kennedy, a surgeon with the army at

Hyderabad.

The Bank of Caswell was a small bank that
was located in the town of Milton on the Dan
River in northern Caswell County. It is listed
during 1906-1913 in the North Carolina Year
Book. In 1906 the capital was given as only

 

$5,000. The figures in the Daily Balance Book

also document the limited size of the bank.

Banks, Nathaniel Prentice MSS. 1850-1880
Historical Sketch, items
Nathaniel P. Banks, son of Nathaniel P. and
Rebecca Greenwood Banks, was born at Waltham, Mass
on Jan. 30,1816. The self educated youth studied
Latin and Spanish ,for he believed that the U.S.

 

and South America would some day be brought into
close contact. In early manhood he was recognized
as apower in the town meetings. He turned to law
was admitted to the bar, but never practiced.

‘ Banks first Public service was inspector
in the Boston customs e He was seven times

 
Banks, N.P. 2
candidate for the lower House of the Mass. leg-
islature before he was elected in 1849. In 1851
he was made speaker of the House. In 1853 he
was chosen president of the constitutional con-
vention in Mass. over which he preside: with tact
and self control.

 

Banks entered Congress in 1853 and served
in ten Gongresses, representing five party allig
ments. As a Democrat he opposed the Kansas— Neb
raska Bill. In the 34th Congress he was put for
ward as Speaker by the American Party, and the
ensuing strugglewas “6 the most stubborn in

 
Banks, N.P. 3

the history of the House. His election on the
133rd ballot was regarded as a defeat for slaver
and as the first victory for the Republican Part
Banks was considered as one of the ablest and, f
ficient Speakers. His decisions were prompt and
impartial, although he was Speaker during a per-

iod of bitter partisanship.

In 1856 he declined the nomination for
President from the convention of the North Am-
Teicans, the anti-slavery seceders from the Am-
ericans. In 1857 he cast aside the Americans to
accept the Republican eo as Governor of

 
Banks, N.P. 4

Mass. He served wisely and well 1858-60.
In 1861 Banks succeded G.B. McCellan as
President of the Illinois Ventral Rail Road.
In May 1861 Banks was commissioned Major-
General. His campaign in the Valley of Virginia
in 1862 was unsuccessful. He was a few months

 

later removed to Washington and put in chage of
the defenses there. He succeeded Gen.B.F. Butler
at New Orleans, and aided Grant in opening the

Mississippi. In 1864 panks was sent on the Red

River Expedition, altRouch he ainst
it. The object was to ili iin

 
Banks, N.P. 5
in Mexico.

In 1865 Banks returned to Mass. and was $e*T
immediately to Congress. He was Chairman of
Military Affairs at the time Maximilian was in
Mexico. He advised a bold stand in regard to the
Alabama claims, he promoted the acquisition of

 

Alaska, and supported a measure requiring all
naturalized citizens to renounce all allegiance
to their native land. His quarrel with Grant made
him support Greeley in 1872.

In_ 1874 he was elected to the Mass. Legis-
lature. In 1874 he was eo to Congress as a

 
Bamks, N.P. 6

Democrat; in 1876 he was elected as a Republican.
In 1878 he was appointed U.S. marshall for Mass.
In 1888 he was again elected to Congress on the
Republican ticket.
He died Septe 1. 1894.
Contents
The letters are valuable especially in the

 

history of the American Party. The relations
between local and national politics are shown,
and the use of patronage is interestingly illus-

trated.

 
Banks, N. P. i A

Letter or Nov. Looo from Henry W. Cush-
man to Banks about politics in Mass. He
feels that the state offices should be diyvid-
ed equally between the Democrats and Free
Soilers, and if the Democrats should be the
ones to furnish the speaker of the house,
Banks should have that office.

and requesting its repeal.

 
Banks, N. P, 3

90 items, added 9-12-63, are from the officia
papers of General Banks and contain details of
the first six months of his military command.
Banks left the presidency of the Illinois Centra
R. R. on May 6, 1861, to accept a commission
as major general of volunteers from President
Lincoln, thus ranking with Generals Scott, Fré-
mont, and McClellan. His political career as
a moderate radical had make him a possible
presidential nominee by the Republican Party
in 1860, and he was a favorite of Presidént

Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward. In this

 

 
Banks, N., P. 10
addition these two men stand as powerful shadows
in the background, while General Banks combines
his political talents and military power to

hold Maryland in the Union: In these months

he saw no military action, and his papers at this
time are a study in his dealing with disaffected
citizens of Maryland.

 

On June 11, 1861, General Banks became com-
mander of the Department of Annapolis, a forty-
square mile area controlling a vital corridor
from the Northern States into Washington. He

found great confusion. General Benjamin F. But-

 
Banks, N. P. EL

 

ler had left for Fortress Monroe, as Lincoln
tried to conciliate the disaffected elements
and hold Maryland. A printed page from the
Journal of Proceedings of the Maryland Senate,
June 5, 1861, reveals the divided opinion on
the Confederacy, adjournment of the Senate, and
outrages. (This clipping was probably used to
secure names when the suspected members of the
legislature were arrested in September).

The papers reveal informers and espionage at
work almost immediately after the war began.
Loyal citizens are recommended. Thomas Rawlings

 

 

 
Banks, N. P. 12

 

denounces Police Commissioner George Proctor
Kane as a traitor (Kane had helped save the
Massachusetts troops in the Baltimore riots
of April 19, 1861.) Montgomery Blair, the
Postmaster General, and General Eutler both
write to General Banks,

On June 12, 1861, in a letter to the U. S.
Attorney General, Edward Bates, Banks discusses
the question of a policy of posse comitatus.
Lincoln evidently doubted the wisdom of turning
the people of a county into a posse to aid the
sheriff. Panks states adequate measures will

 

 
Banks, N. P, 13
be taken to preserve peace during the election
on June 13, 1861.

On June 17, 1861, Stephen Hoyt reports to
Banks on Edward Bates. Secretary of War Simon
Cameron sanctions use of secret service funds
which are available, and hesitates to sanction
a Maryland home guard. General Winfield Scott
boasts he is "ahead of Jefferson] Davis," and
will continue so. Hoyt recommends Judge Bates,
a friend of Banks, to obtain the ear of General
Scott.

John Merryman of "Hawfields," lst lieutenant

 

 
Banks, N. P, 14

of the Baltimore County Horse Guards, had been
arrested on May 25, 1861, for his role in con-
fused military events in May. His trial had
evoked a famous appearance of Chief Justice
Taney. Merryman, still imprisoned, writes a
note to Banks, Other correspondence, June 18, .
1861, states Merryman is not as much of a se-
cessionist as one would think. John Howard
McHenry appealed to General John Gross Barnard,
Chief of Army Engineers, to intervene for Merry-
man; hence, Barnard writes to Montgomery Blair
on June 21, 1861, to do what he can for Merryman%

 

 
Banks, N. P,. 15

 

Blair writes to Banks on June 21, 1861, to look
into the case, as President Lincoln does not
wish useless severity, much less injustice.

Henry Winter Davis (1817-1865),the radical
congressman from Maryland, makes a number of
recommendations to Banks, but he does not ap-
pear in a prominent role in these papers.

Montgomery Blair became concerned over the
Missouri Military Bill, which provided for
raising militiamen through the county commis-
sioners who were mostly secessionists. He
believed this to be treason. On June 27, 1861,

 
Banks, N. P. 16

 

he called on Banks to issue a proclamation con-
demning the bill. The proclamation was to calm
the public mind disturbed by the thought of
Civil War.

Tightening control of Maryland resulted on
June 27, 1861, in the arrest of Police Marshal
Kane of Baltimore, upon orders from Wathington.
Banks did not, however, arrest the other four

 
Banks, N. P. 16-A

 

commissioners. Banks and Kane exchanged notes
on June 27 and 28, 1861. After fourteen months
imprisonment Kane was sent South. He returned
to become Sheriff of Baltimore in 1873 and
mayor in 1878,

Among letters of approval of Banks' actions
is one from Pennsylvania Congressman William
Morris Davis,

Montgomery Blair appealed to Banks on July

 
Banks, N. P, 17
1, 1861, to make a "flying trip" to Washington
while the House of Representatives was being
organized in order to promote the election of
Frank P. Blair, Jr., as chairman of the Military
Defense Committee.

The appointment of a marshal of Baltimore
city police was a problem. A copy of a letter

 

to Mrs. Jerome Bonaparte of Baltimore, with no
signature, may have been from Banks. The writer
lists suitable candidates for the position.
General Banks appointed Col. John Reese Kenly of
the lst Maryland Volunteers, acting police

 
Banks, N. P, 18
marshal, and Kenly's resignation on July 10
brought the appointment of George R. Dodge.
Drafts of Banks! proclamation to the citizens

of Baltimore announcing the appointment of George
Dodge are accompanied by copies of general orders
detaining troops in camp and naming advisors to
Marshal Dodge. Susan (Williams) Bonaparte
writes on July 11, 1861, of the illness of her
husband, Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, tells of

a N. Y. soldier begging at Catholic doors (which
she states are usually Secessionist), and men-
tions the visit of Henry May, Maryland Unionist,

 

 
Banks, N. P. 19
to Richmond,

William H. Seward expresses the confidence of
Lincoln and himself in General Banks to handle
cases of political prisoners, such as Charles
May, appointed by the Maryland General Assembly
as police commissioner.

Charles Howard (1802-1869), removed and im-
prisoned for sixteen months, was one of the
most benevolent and philanthropic of Maryland's
citizens.

Routine correspondence includes recommenda-
tions, denouncements of secessionists, press

 

 
Banks, N. Ps. 20
changes, and formation of a Maryland home guard.
On July 28, 1861, Schuyler Colfax congratu-
lates General Banks on his appointment as com-

mander of the Department of the Shenandoah.
Senator Colfax comments at length on the tariff
and Thaddeus Stevens as chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee. Mention is made

 

of a woman lobbyist for a rifle contract.
Benjamin F, Butler recommends his brother,

Col. Andrew Butler, to Banks on Aug. 7, 1861.
Closely related to General Banks' command was

the lst Maryland Regiment under Col. John Reese

 
Banks, N. P, a1
Kenly, who writes on August 11, 1861, of Con-
federate troop movements. He mentions Lt. Col.
Nathan T. Dushane, who later commanded the Mary-
land lst (See the Purviance-Courtenay Papers in
this department).

George Ashmun, Massachusetts Congressman
and close friend of General Banks, writes a

 

confidential political letter on August 14,
1861, Ashmun evidently had great political
influence at this time, so that his opinions on
political trends are worthy of note. Ashmun
states there must be a change in some depart-
ments of government, . ey the War and

 
Banks, N. P. 22

 

Navy Departments which are under public attack,
Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase is
predicted to have trouble securing "his loan"
from New York bankers without assurance to them
of a more energetic and effective government,
Samuel Bowles, able editor of the Springfield
(Mass.) Republican, is to begin an editorial
campaign pointed at an effectual change in
government personnel. Ashmun states he has
been cheering a greatly distressed President
Lincoln, who does not know of the great popu-
lar disaffection which is "not quite ripe."

 

 
Banks, N. P, 23

A number of references to the Roman Catholics
of Maryland is in the Banks correspondence. Coli
Fletcher Webster of the 12th Massachusetts
Regiment reports on Aug. 18, 1861, on Father
Wigett of Frederick and Washington, D. C., and
Father Wigett writes on Aug. 21, 1861, of his
expulsion from the camp of the 12th Mass. by

 

Webster. On Aug. 22, 1861, Surgeon George E,
Cooper recommends that General Banks permit
Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Md., be
allowed to proceed to Richmond to serve as
nurses, explaining the reaction of Maryland

 
Banks, N. P. 24

 

Catholics if they are not given passes,

General John Adams Dix succeeded General
Banks as commander of the Department of Annapo-
lis, A number of telegrams between them concern
shipping prisoners to the Tortugas and to meet-
ings.

Evidently the Maryland clergy was under

suspicion, as letters of Aug. 20 and Sept. 3,
1861, reveal. As the November election for
governor approaches, uneasiness is manifested

by the Unionists, and arrests of Democrats con-
tinue. Wm. Veers Bowie and others are imprison-
ed. Montgomery Blair eo" for Bowie.

 
Banks, N. P, 25
George R. Dodge, the police marshal of Balti-
more reports more arrests. These prisoners are
incarcerated at Ft. McHenry . Dodge also writes
of the Reverend Wm. H. Wilson, a "Peace Man,"
which he says is the latest "secession dodge,"
On Oct. 28, 1861, Dodge discusses allowing
Maryland soldiers to vote in order to secure mor
Union votes,

Sometime in late September a report to
General Banks which was forwarded to Washington
on the 30th of that month, was presemably writteyr
by Union agent Robert Carlisle. Carlisle had

 

 
Banks, N. P, 26
travelled through Virginia gathering informa-
tion. He describes the encircling camps at
Richmond and the 180,000 to 200,000 Confederate
troops around Manassas. Clothing and provisions
are scarce, especially salt. Prices are de-
tailed, and the manufacture of ordnance and
ammunition at Richmond and Manchester is des-

 

cribed. Sickness prevails among soldiers and
Civilians, and water supplies are very bad at
Manassas. U.S. prisoners from Bull Run are
in warehouses on the wharf at Richmond, as are
the Confederate wounded and the captured U. S.

 
Banks, N. P. 27

 

muskets and guns,

On Oct. 28, 1861, Lt. Col. George R. Dennis
volunteers to have the lst Regiment of the
Potomac Home Brigade do guard duty.

The Nov. 6 election brought comment from
Marshal Dodge as to precautions to maintain a
Union majority by requiring loyalty oaths of

disaffected citizens and then arresting those
in opposition. Benjamin C. Howard, Democrat,
was running against Augustus Williamson Brad-
ford, Unionist, for governor. On Nov. 2, 1861,
Governor Thos. Holliday Hicks, predicts the

 
Banks, N. P. 28
Union faction will win, as it did in what was
reputed to' be the most fraudulant election in
Maryland up to that time. Correspondence from
Banks! military command includes a report by
Col. Leonard of the 13th Mass. Regiment at
Williamsport on Jackson's forces near Winchester
Va. The artist, David Hunter Strother, a native

 

of Jefferson county, Virginia, and a Union
officer on Banks' staff, reports on Nov. 16
and 17, 1861, from a scouting trip up the
Potomac River Valley on Confederate troop
movements in Virginia. Ashby at Charlestown,

 
Banks, N. P. 29

 

Va., and Jackson at Winchester, Va., send
forage teams into Jefferson and Berkeley coun-
ties. Strother believed the Confederate forces
in the Shenandoah Valley to be in bad condition,
Union General Benjamin F. Kelley was at Romney,
Va. with 10,000 men. He was reported to be
receiving Confederate militia deserters. Stro-

ther found that the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
remained broken, but the Baltimore and Ohio R.
R. had been repaired. Rebellion west of Winches
ter, Va., was ended,

Evidently canal boats and tools had been

 
Banks, N. P. 30

 

seized by the U. S. Army, as the C. anc O, Canal
superintendent applied to General Banks for
this equipment or for news thereof.

Among the correspondents are Charles Carroll
Fulton, George Brinton McClellan, J. Morrison
Harris, and Charles Pomeroy Stone,

Files of General Banks' correspondence as

commander of the Department of Annapolis were
captured sometime in May, 1862, by General
Thomas Jonathan Jackson in the campaign around
Winchester, Virginia. A portion of these files
seem to be the manuscripts comprising this

 
Banks, N. P. 31

 

addition to the Banks Papers in this depart-
ment. A rare pamphlet. now at the Library of
Congress entitled, Secret Correspondence Illus-
trating the Condition of Affairs in Maryland
was published in Baltimore in 1863 — by Southern
sympathizers. This pamphlet is based on the
captured Banks' files and is evidently a selec-
tion from them of the letters sent by spies

and informers to General Banks! headquarters.
The pamphlet correspondence and the original
manuscripts of this addition supplement each
other, but are in no way duplicates. None of

 

 

 

 
Banks, N. P, BY

the material appears in the Official Records of
the War of the Rebellion, I, Vol. 1, but the
correspondence there also supplements the let-
ters and pamphlet. A Xerox copy of the pam-
phlet is with the Banks Papers. For biographi-
cal details, consult Fred Harvey Harrington,

Paris, France

 

The Marquis de Barbé-Marbois (1745-1837),
French statesman, is especially remembered as
the man who sold Louisiana to the United States.
At that time he was Napoleon's finance minister.

In the early 1780's he held diplomatic assign-
ments in America where he married Elizabeth
Moore of Philadelphia. During 1785-1789 he was
intendant of St. Domingue, now Haiti.
Barbé-Marbois's letter of June 29, 1786, was

 
Barbé-Marbois, Francois, Marquis de 2
written from Port-au-Prince. It concerned con-
traband and commercial relations between the
French West Indies and the United States and how
the European states might handle the problem of
American traders. The identity of the addressee
is uncertain. He may have been the Chevalier de
Brun (persons of that name and title are listed

 

in the Dictionnaire de la Noblesse). The addres-
see was in America, because Barbe-Marbois asked
him to check upon his wife's family in Phila-

 

delphia.

James Barbour (1775-1842), soné of Thomas Bar
pour was born in Orange Co., Va. Whilé serwing
as deputy sheriff, he acquired sufficient know-
ledge of law to be amitted to the bar. He sat i
the Virginia House of Delegates from 1796 until
1812, when he was elected governor. After the
expiration of his term in 1815, he was elected
to the U. S. Senate, where he was repeatedly
appointed chairman of the committee on foreign
relations. He served as Secretary of War for
John Q. Adams and in 1828 he went to Englard as

 

 
Barbour, James Sketch 2
minister to be recalled the next year upon
Jackson's accession. He opposed the democratic
party and in 1839 presided over the Whig conven-
tion at Harrisburg, which nominated Gen. Harrisa@

The collection is of little intrinsic value.
One letter deals with the building of a proposed
canal between the Potomac and Rappahanock, which
Barbour evidently supports. The other is a note
to a Mr. Rice to the effect that Barbour was
leaving Washington on the following day.

Barbour, John N. Papers, 1832-1881. Boston,
Mass. 56 items. Sketch

These letters and documents deal primar-
ily with the activities of the firm of Sulli-
van and Barbour in two quite different fields,
trade and commerce and the copper mines of
Lake Superior.

 

John N. Barbour was a prosperous merchant
of Boston, who, with his cousin John W. Sulli-
van, established the firm of Sullivan and Bar-
bour of Commercial Street. Most of the docu-
ments of 1832 through 1834, with a few of

later years, are “o" with domestic and

 
Barbour, John N,
foreign trade. Various products are received
from and sent to individuals and firms in Me.,
Mass., New Hamp., and even Dubuque, Iowa. The
financial and banking difficulties, especially
in Me., are a matter of concern,

In 1833, and especially in 1834, there are

 

exceedingly valuable and detailed documents
dealing with foreign commerce, chiefly with
cities in Italy. There is much material con-
cerning the points in the U. 8S. and South
America and the cities in Italy from which and

to which cargoes “6” the names of

 
Barbour, John N, 3
the ships and their captains, the cargoes,
prices, weight, insurance, rates of exchange,
comparative quality of goods and markets,
and economic conditions affecting trade and
prices,

A Mr. W. S. Fitzwilliam was the agent

 

between Sullivan and Barbour and the several
branches of Gower and Co. in London, Trieste,
and Genoa.

The variety of products mentioned is
amazing: spices of many kinds, cotton, wool,
hides, rags, a a oil, coffee, sugar,

 
Barbour, John N, &
shellac, gums, honey, nuts, silk, indigo,

rice, wheat, Indian corn, rye, oats, beans,
barley, steel, wax, camels hair, ginger, hemp,
senna, Persian berries, cocoa, dyes, shumac,
brimstone, wood. One letter of Apr. 30, 1834,
from Genoa speaks of the business depression
in the U. S. and its effect on commerce and

 

prices. One of Aug. 28, 1834, from A. A.
Gower & Nephews of London to Barbour discusses
the failure of the whale fishery in Davis
Straits and of the raisin and olive crops in
Spain and Italy and a effect on prices.

 
Barbour, John N,. 5.
One of June 14, 1834 from J. J. Gower & Co.
of Genoa speaks of the new product, refined
and crushed sugar, being refined in Boston,
New York, and New Orleans, and compares the
quality of the English and American product.
Beginning in 1837 most of the items are

 

concerned with prospecting for copper in the
region of Lake Superior, the attempts to lo-
cate claims, the formation of companies, the
difficulties involved, etc. The earliest is
a letter of Feb. 27, 1837 from Henry Leavitt
Ellsworth, who was y U. S. Commission-

 
Barbour, John N, 6
er of Patents, to Hon. Abbott Lawrence, a
member of the House of Representatives from
Mass., who was a Boston merchant and importer
and later minister to Great Britain. Ells-
worth writes about the assignments of Sullivan
and Barbour to be placed on the books of the

 

office.

Barbour was greatly interested in having
his claims located, staked, and properly en-
tered, and a Boston company organized. Ina
letter of Oct. 13, 1837 John N. Bolles wrote

to Barbour about the “St played by Sullivan

 
Barbour, John N, 7
in the origin of the “American Land Co., about
his own efforts in organizing the Ala. and
Miss. Land Companies, and the aid given by
Richard Fletcher, a member of the House of
Representatives from Mass. who later became
Judge of the Supreme Court of Mass., and

 

Samuel Dickinson Hubbard, a Representative
from Conn., later Postmaster General of the
U. S., as well as of the political influence
of a Daniel D. Brodhead, who had originated
the Miss. Land Co.

Evidently om \ influences played a

 
Barbour, John N. 8
large part in this whole matter. Bolles
speaks of a letter written for Mr. Butler of
New York by Gen. Dix, of Albany, who was John
Adams Dix, a brother-in-law of John Sullivan,
who was Secretary of State in N. Y. from 1833
to 1839 and later a Senator and Secretary of

 

the Treasury. Bolles mentions various influ-
ential men in Washington and New York and
suggests that Butler be made president of the
company. He mentions both C. and B. F. Butler
and probably means that Benjamin Franklin But-
ler should be om \ since Butler was a

 
Barbour, John N. 9_
prominent politician and interested in western
lands.

There is a good deal of correspondence,
chiefly in 1845 and 1846, between Barbour,
S. W. Higgins, the agent to whom Barbour en-
trusted his interests, Bela Hubbard, a geolo-

 

gist, and a few others. In them the many de-
lays and difficulties are discussed and
various men are mentioned, among them Gen.
John M. Stockton, Superintendent of Mineral
Lands in Detroit, who was undoubtedly Gen.

John Stockton of the ry Michigan Cavalry,

 
Barbour, John N. 10
Senator Porter, who was Augustus Seymour Port-
er, Senator from Mich., Dr. Houghton, who was
Douglass Horton, the "little doctor," whose
life was written in 1848 after his death by
Bela Hubbard, as well as various others in-
terested in one way or another in the con-

 

flicting claims and the problems of location.
On Nov. 28, 1845 Macy & Driggs, of the
Western Land Agency in Detroit sent to Barbour
as full a list as they could compile of the
copper companies and their officers. Sixteen
companies were a’ In that same year

 
Barbour, John N. 11
Barbour himself went to Detroit to investigate
the situation.

In 1880 and 1881 Barbour, acting as exe-
cutor of the estate of Seth Adams, wrote to
and received letters from Isaac Adams of Sand-
wich, N. H., relative to the burial and monu-
ment of his brother Seth. Isaac Adams was
the famous inventor of the Adams Power Press
and with hts brother had established in Boston
the firm of I. & S. Adams.

unsigned, are ae 3s One is an unfinish

The last seems to be in the handwriting of

Barbour. It was evidently written to someone
of political influence in the House of Repre-
sentatives, excoriating him for approving of
the appointment of Gen. Andrews as commander
of the Mass. militia. He speaks bitterly of

 

giving military power to "a paid agent of the
enemy. "

Which Gen. Andrews is meant is uncertain.

Aside from the men mentioned above there
were many others, citizens of New York, Bos-

various companies or interested in western
lands and copper. The most important, ap-

 

parently, were Thomas Hubbard of N. Y., Thomas

Hebert Cutzlatt Barclay (July 15, loas-Nov.
19, 1876) was born near Charlottesville, Albe-
marle Co., Va. (The ancient Scottish-English

Barclay family came to America in the 1680's.)
Thomas Barclay, born 1805 in Albemarle Co., Va.,

 

and James Turner Barclay born 1807 in Hanover
Co., Va., both attended the U. Of Va. James
Turner Barclay took his M. D. at the U. of Pa.,
lived briefly at "Monticell," and went to
Jerusalem as a Campbellite missionary for three
years. He taught at Bethany College after the

 
 

Barcla Robert Gutzlaff 2
Civil War, finally migrating to Alabama. Here
he wrote, taught, and preached. A daughter
Sarah contributed the sketches for his Syrian

works. Jaimess T. Barclay made two trips to
Palestine.

Quite probably his son was Robert Gutzlaff

Barclay, the missionary-physician whose career
parallets that of the father, J. T. Barclay, so
Closely. A letter from Dean William Pepper of
the U. of Pa. School of Medicine on April 28,
1941, places Robert's birth on July 15, 1832,
near Charlottesville, Va. (probably when J. T.

 
 

Barcla Robert Gutzlaff ts)
Barclay was residing at "Monticello"). Young

Master Robert and his brother, John Judson Bar-
Clay, were sent to Dr. J. Worster in Nov., 1832,
for an examination which resulted in an elabo»
rate phrenological chart of the two boys. Going
to Jerusalem in 1850 as a missionary (probably

with his father for a three years' stay), Robert
Barclay returned to Philadelphia to study at
Jefferson Medical College. He graduated in
1857, went to Beirut, Syria, to practice medicine
from 1859 to 1866. He served as American Vice
Consul. He returned to Philadelphia in 1866.

Barden, Graham Arthur. Papers. New Bern,
Craven Co., N.C.

 

Graham Arthur Barden was born in Turkey
Township, Sampson County, North Carolina, in
1896. He was educated at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill and while prac-
ticing law in New Bern was elected to the state

House of Representatives. After serving one
term in the state legislature, he was elected
to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1934.
He represented the Third District from 1935

 
Barden, Graham Arthur. 2
until his retirement in 1961. He died in New
Bern in 1967,

Barden's papers consist almost entirely of
his congressional office files. A small
group of papers relates to his term in the
state assembly and to his congressional cam-
paign in 1934. The original filing arrangement
used by his office staff has been retained when
ever possible, and the papers have been grouped
into five series with relevant categories des-
ignated within each series, An inventory

 

 
Barden, Graham Arthur 3
Filed in the Inventory File drawer describes
the arrangement in greater detail and lists the
contents of each box. A limited number of sub-
ject entries has been prepared for the card
catalog, but no autograph entries were made
citing individual items written by prominent
people,

 

 

The papers include extensive correspondence
exchanged between Barden and his constituents.
The letters relate to both local and national

matters. Barden was appointed to the House

 
Barden, Graham Arthur 4
Education Committee in 1935 and in the next
session of Congress was appointed to the Labor
Committee as well. He served on both of these
committees until they were merged in 1947. He
was chairman otf the combined committee in 1951
and 1952 and from 1955 through 1960. Numerous
files concern matters related to federal aid

to education and other issues associated with
education and to such topics concerning labor
as strikes, the Taft-Hartley and Landrum-
Griffin acts, labor-management relations, and
minimum wage legislation. Other areas in which

 

 
Barden, Graham Arthur

Barden had a particular interest are agricul-
tural development in his predominantly rural
district and the establishment of military
installations in North Carolina, especially

Thomas George Baring, First Earl of Northe-
brook (1826-1904), held a series of high offi-
ces at the Admiralty, in the Cabinet, and in
India, 1857-1885. He was viceroy and governor
general of India, 1872-1876, and first lord

of the Admiralty, 1880-1885. The correspon-
dence in this collection relates to his direc-
tion of the Admiralty Officé, to Britain's
Afghan policy in 1879-1880, to politics at the
turn of the century, and to other miscellaneous

topics.

 
Baring, Thomas George, First Earl of 2
Northbrook.

 

Several letters of 1880-1885, concern per-
sonnel at the Admiralty Office and its adminis-
trative organization. In March, 1882, George
Wightwick Rendel becomes a civil lord of the
Admiralty. Planning for his position and
duties, however, goes back to the previous min-

istry when William Henry Smith was first lord.
William Codrington, formerly secretary at the
Admiralty, writes to Northbrook about Smith's
plans for Rendel (Oct. 26, 1881). Rendel
would be consulting engineer, especially for

 
Baring, Thomas George, First Earl of
Northbrook.

 

the construction and arming of ships. He

would not head a department. Although Rendel
would work immediately under the controller, he
would have access to the first lord and to the
Admiralty Board even when the controller dis-
agreed with his proposals. Smith also thought

that R,ndel might be a means of quietly imple-
menting improvements in the management of the
dockyards. In November Northbrook receives
advice from Viscount Goschen, a former first
lord of the Admiralty (Nov. 7.1881). Goschen
concurs in the choice of Rendel, but hesitates

 
Baring, Thomas George, First Earl of
Northbrook.

 

to put both him and the controller on the
Board. In any case, there should be no reduc-
tion in the number of naval lords. In 1872
when Goschen was first lord, he wanted to pro-
tect the office of controller from changes at
the Admiralty Office that were caused by the
rise and fall of ministries. He mentions the
opinions of Hugh Culling Eardley Childers, his
predecessor as first lord, about his proposals
on organization. On March 3, 1882, Edward
Seymour, Twelfth Duke of Somerset, First Lord
of the Admiralty, 1859-1866, returns papers

 
Baring, Thomas George, First Earl of 5
Northbrook.
to Northbrook. Somerset agrees that the Ad-
miralty needs assistance with engineering and
the economical organization of labor, subjects
on which naval officers are not fully qualified.
Whether or not this assistance should be sought
by an increase in the size of the Board,
Somerset will not say. It appears from these
letters that Northbrook was seeking expert ad-
vice about administrative procedure at the
Admiralty Office.

Two letters of March 7 and 9, 1882, concern
the proper form of a ry Order in Council

relative to the Admiralty Board, but the nature
of the document is not indicated. The letters
are from Stephen Edward Spring-Rice, one of the
private secretaries to the junior lords of the
treasury, to Henry Francis Redhead Yorke, one
of the assistant private secretaries to the

 

first lord of the Admiralty.

There are four letters ffom Gladstone, Prime
Minister, in 1880 and 1882. Gladstone is glad
that Northbrook will revise Hunt's reactionary
scheme (unspecified) and will reintroduce com-
petition (George Ward Hunt was first lord,

1874-1877). The Prime Minister discusses
arrangements for two appointments--George Shaw-
Lefevre as first commissioner of works and
George Otto Trevelyan as secretary to the Ad-
miralty. Gladstone writes favorably of Tre-
velyan and of Thomas Brassey, Civil Lord of the

Admiralty, 1880-1883. On May 11, 1882, Henry
Campbell-Bannerman accepts the position as sec-
retary to the Admiralty, but admits that he
will “have the whole thing to learn." On Nov.
18, 1882, Gladstone concurs in Northbrook's

 

 
Baring, Thomas George, First Earl of
Northbrook.

proposed appointment of Frederick Beauchamp
Seymour as a lord of the Admiralty.

On Jan. 13, 1885, Thomas Brassey, Secretary
to the Admiralty, writes to Northbrook (12% pp.)
about pensions for widows, administration of
Greenwich Hospital, details of the preparation

 

of naval estimates, and recommendations of the
work of several staff members (George T. Lambert,
one of the private secretaries; Follett Pennell,
Deputy Accountant General; and C. D. Loveless of
the Greenwich Hospital branch of the account-
ant's office). On “~@ 16, 1881, the Earl

 
Baring, Thomas George, First Earl of 9

of Morley, Under Secretary for War, gives his
opinion on promotions in rank for naval cap-
tains after twenty years of service and also
on promotions for clerks in the commandants*
offices.

A detailed list of the personnel at the

Admiralty Office appears in the annual vobhumes
of Whitaker's Almanack. There are two lists
in each volume of which one list is elaborate.
The naval estimates are also given.

Several letters on politics date from 1900.

On May 4 Sir Edward Grey (later Viscount Grey
of Fallodon), a prominent Liberal politician,
discusses the events of that day in the House
of Commons. fhe ministry won the vote on the
army estimates for 1900-1901, but Grey reports
that even its own supporters acted coldly dur-
ing the debate. He thinks that the ministers
meant no harm, but they were inept in publish-
ing their conversations with Roberts and the
suggestion made to Buller (Sir Redvers Henry
Buller, a commanding general in the Boer War,
1899-1900; and =e Roberts, later

 
Baring, Thomas George, First Earl of 11
Northbrook.

 

First Earl Roberts, Commandér=in-Chief, South
Africa, , 1899-1900). On July 28 Grey writes
a letter that bristles with opinions of con-
temporary politictans (11 pp.). He criticizes
Campbell-Bannerman's departure from the House
of Commons on July 25, an action that left the
field to the anti-war party. Grey contends
that Campbell-Bannerman, leader of the Liberals
in the House of Commons, has failed and should
resign. Actually, Grey lacks confidence in all
the leading politicians, but he would feel

 
Baring, Thomas George, First Earl of 12
Northbrook.

 

better if Kosebery would lead a party with
Asquith as leader in Commons. Grey also states
his opinions of: Arthur Balfour, First Lord

of the Treasury; “ir Michael Hicks-Beach, Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer; William Brodrick, soon
to be secretary of state for war; Joseph Cham-
berlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies;
the Duke of Devonshire, Lord President of the
Council; Hichard Burdon Haldane, Liberal M. P.;
the Marquis of Salisbury, Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs; and George Wyndham, Par-

liamentary Under Secretary of State for War.
On Dec. 4 Lord Morley, Chairman of Committees
and Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords, dis-
cusses problems with the Tramways Act of 1870
and the question of local consent to tramway
construction.

An isolated letter relating to India is from
Sayaji Rao Gaekwar III, Maharaja of Baroda
(Nov. 30, 1900). He reports the dispatch of
papers and correspondence about his visits to
Europe. He protests against the inadequacy of

 
Baring, Thomas George, First Earl of 14
Northbrook,

 

the versions given by finished administrative
reports on Indian affairs. The Indian people
suppress their true feelings,and the result is
vexation for the Raja. The background of his
remarks is not apparent.

Included in this collection is an excellent

series of extracts (31% pp) from the letters of
Sir Nevtlle Bowles Chamberlain, Commander in
Chief, Madras Army, 1876-1881. His letters
date, Sept. 8, 1879-Feb. 12, 1880, during the
Second Afghan War. To whom this correspondence

is addressed is not certain. According to no-
tations on pp. 1 and 32, the extracts were sent
to Northbrook, and they are marked as being in
Lord Ripon's letter of Apr. 29, 1880. (Ripon
succeeds Lord Lytton as governor general of
India and serves during 1880-1884). At this
time British troops are intervening in Afghan-
istan, and Chamberlain is severely critical of
the war and of the policies that led to it. He
denounces the Afghan policy of Lord Lytton,
Viceroy of India, 1876-1880, and also attacks

 
Baring, Thomas George, First Earl of 16
Northbrook.

the actions of Frederick Sleigh Roberts, British
commander in Afghanistan. However, he admires
Roberts personally. Chamberlain argues that
Britain has been unnecessarily harsh toward
Afghanistan, a country whose friendship is need-
ed as a buffer between India and Russia. Persia;

 

he contends, lacks the geographic and political
qualifications as a substitute buffer state.

He also states that Indian finances are not
prospering despite contrary assertions by Sir
Stafford Henry Northcote, Chancellor of the
Exchequer. Chamberlain_also makes some inter-

esting comments about the effect of education
and the press on the awakening of Indian politie
cal opinion (p. 12). These extracts are excel-
lent, detailed statements of Chamberlain s
analysis and opinion on the Afghan situation and
British policy toward it.

In 1880 Northbrook is president of the Royal

 

Geographical Society. Sir Clements Markham,
its secretary, discusses arrangements for the
visit of Nils Nordenskiold, Scandinavian nat-
uralist and traveller: (March 20, 26, 1880).
Markham also recommends_an invitation to Philip

he can attend the meeting for his friend, Nor-

1783. William was evidently a relative of Pete
Barksdale, a Halifax Co. tobacco farmer. There
is considerable correspondence concerning the

purchase of slaves, which William negotiated fo
Peter. There are also some letters from Ran-

educated at Bedford Female Seminary, Edward at

a great deal of information. There are also a
few letters of a later period, and they too are

relatively unimportant. The most valuable por-

tivities in Petersburg and tobacco culture in

Grief Barksdale(1774-1850), from Rough Creek,
Charlotte County, Virginia, was a successful
merchant andplanter as well as an occasional
officeholder in the county. During the War of
1812, he saw active service as a captain in the

county militia. He fathered ten children, of
whom Charlotte(1813-1886), Claiborne (1820-1883),
Nancy (1829-1904), and Susan(1832-1863) are im-
portant in the correspondence of this collectio

 
Barksdale-Hannah Family 2

 

Charlotte married in 1837 Samuel Hannah(1/96-
1859) of Charleston, Kanawha County. In 1811,
Hannah had resided in Charlotte County, but by
1825 he was situated as a tobacco merchant and
slaveowner in Lynchburg. Sometime before 1837,
he had moved to Charleston, where he became
affiliated with the Northwestern Bank of Vir-

ginia.Between 1851 and his death, he had moved
back to Charlotte County. Further biographical
information is in Barksdale Family History and

Genealogy compiled by John A. Barksdale and

 

 
Barksdale-Hannah Family 3
published in Richmond in 1940,

The collection consists of 30 items written
between 1811 and 1870. Half of these are per-
sonal correspondence of Hannah, all but one of
which were sent to Hannah from either persons he
did business with or from friends and members of
the Barksdale family. The remainder of the

 

collection is correspondence of the children of
Grief Barksdale, either between each other or
with friends. The letters are best at showing
business conditions and interests, especially
relating to tobacco, of Hannah and those he

 
Barksdale-Hannah Family 4

 

corresponded with, There are also several items
of special interest in the collection. Two
letters from Hannah's tobacco agent in Liver-
pool in 1828-1829 are concerned with the import
duties levied by Great Britain on tobacco. An-
other letter of 1827 mentions slave hiring in
Richmond. There is also a letter from New Or-

leans to which is attached a commercial schedule
for that city for January 15, 1840. ‘Two letters
of 1844 are from a schoolmaster in Charlotte
Court House, and to one is attached the report

 
Barksdale-Hannah Family 5
cards of two of Grief Barksdale's children at
the school, There is also an advertisement from
a mercantile establishment in Farmville, Vir-
ginia in 1851, and a letter of 1870 from an
individual who went west and reported on con-
ditions in Arkansas to his friends back in
Virginia.

Papers, 1802-1347. Farnham, Surrey, England

Sir George Hilaro Barlow, First Baronet
(1762-1846), British administrator in India, had
a significant governmental career from 1779 to
1812. He was involved in the economic reforms
in Gya in the 1780's and was a sub-secretary in
the Revenue Department (1788-1796), Chief

 

Secretary to the Indian Government (1796-1801),
a member of the Supreme Council from 1801,
Governor General (1805-1807), and Governor of

Madras (1807-1812).

 
Barlow, Sir George.Hilaro, First Baronet 2

 

Barlow was promised a peerage during the
ministry of Spencer Perceval whose assassinatio
in 1812 prevented its accomplishment. There-
after he pressed his claims with successive
British governments until his death in 1846.
The manuscripts are primarily a record of his
petitions for the peerage. The basis for this

honor was his career in India, and the papers
also constitute a partial history of his admin-
istration there. The establishment of a legal
code for Bengal, the conclusion of the Mahratta
War in 1805, and the mutiny of 1809 in the

 
Barlow, Sir George Hilaro, First Baronet 3
Madras Army were prominently noted. the
memoranda, original correspondence, and copies
of correspondence provide both a contemporary
and a retrospective view of these matters and of
the controversies surrounding the curtailment o
Barlow's service in India. [In 1807 his pro-
visional appointment as Governal General was

 

cancelled, but he accepted the lesser office of
Governor of Madras. His handling of the mutiny
of 1809 provoked considerable opposition that

grew until his recall by the Court of Directors

of the East India Company in 1812. The

 
Barlow, Sir George Hilaro, First Baronet 4
struggles with his enemies in the court of
Directors and the defensive efforts by his
friends are included in the papers. Numerous
high officials in London and India are repre-
sented by letters and references. He served
with Governor Generals Cornwallis, Wellesley,
and Minto, and some aspects of their adminis-
trations are discussed.

Barlow's career is also discussed in corres-
pondence of 1844-1845 that was provoked by the
publication of Edward Thornton's History of the
British Empire in India. Histories by Sir John

 

 

 
Barlow, Sir George Hilaro, First Baronet 5

 

Malcolm, John Stuart Mill, and Horace Hayman
Wilson were also noted.

Several letters of 1841 and 1844 concern the
death and estate of John Henry Barlow, the
third son of Sir George.

Other manuscripts concern British politics,
and their connection with Barlow is uncertain.

The Reform Bill of 1832 established the Isle of
Wight as a separate election district. A draft
speech is for the nomination of Sir Richard
Godin Simeon, Second Baronet,for the new parlia
mentary seat. The speech dates prior to the

 
Barlow, Sir George Hilaro, First Baronet 6
election of Dec., 1832. A manuscript of July

5, 1841, is the draft of a speech nominating
William Henry Ashe A'Court-Holmes (later Second
Baron Heytesbury) to be reelected to Parliament
from the Isle of Wight. The last three pages of
a letter by John Charles Herries date sometime
during the 1840's. He wrote about the budgets
of 1840 and of other recent years.

1 item added, 5-3-67. A letter of Feb. 12,
1839, is addressed to Admiral Sir Robert Barlow
who is identified by the reference to his

Bernard was a private in the Union army,
having apparently enlisted in 1862 for nine
months. In December, 1862, he was atationed
at Baton Rouge. He mentioned the prevalence
of sickness among the troops, and his interest
in writing and receiving letters. In June, 1863
he participated in the Battle of Port Hudson,
and gives a graphic description of the march
and part of the fighting.

John Gross Barnard (1815-1882), Union general
was chief engineer on Grant's staff in 1864-1865,
This collection of two items concerns his duties
in that post. Both are manuscript copies of
originals. One is a collection of documents
exchanged between Barnard and Major General

Burnside between July 3 and August 6, 1864,
relative to the mining operations under the
Confederate breastworks at Petersburg, Virginia,
and the battle of the Crater on July 30. The
second item, an extract from a letter written

 
Barnard, John Gross x 2
by Barnard to his wife on April 2, 1865, reports
on the last days of the siege of Petersburg.
Barnard predicted the surrender of Lee's army
would occur shortly, because Sheridan's victory
at Five Forks on April 1 caused demoralization
and heavy casualties to the Confederates.

Barnby, George. Commonplace Book, 1746.
England,

 

This commonplace book (48 pp.), entitled
"Songs," is signed by George Barnby and is dated
April 10, 1746. Biographical information about
Barnby has not been found, An examination of
the contents indicates that he was copying or

recording songs that were prevalent in the
1740's, Among the forty-one songs are a number
that can be identified, and Barnby is not the
composer. “Blow, blow, thou winter wind" is
copied from Shakespeare's "As You Like It"

 
Barnby, George, Z

 

(11, vii). Other songs are duplicates of com-
positions that are printed in the Gentleman's
Magazine: "Can love be controlled by advice"
(printed Nov., 1742, as "The modest question");
"All setting day and rising morn" (Sept., 1743,
"The shepherdess"); "Why heaves my fond bosom,"
March, 1745; “God save great George our King,"*
Oct., 1745. Several songs are in the Universal
Songster (London, 1828): "Wheel of life"; "A-
way, away, we've crowned the day," (III, 27);
"Diogenes surly and proud," printed as "The
tippling philosophers." "What care I" appears

* Two versions of the @ anthem are in this

 

book.

 
Barnby, George, 2

 

as "The happy shepherd" in Rev, James Plumptre,
Songs (London, 1806). Love songs are the most
common, but others are humorous (as bawdy or
drinking songs, etc.), serious or meditative, o
patriotic. A couple of songs relate to hunting
and to social conditions,

The information in this sketch was provided

by Roberta Langford, a graduate student in the
English Department who used this songbook as
the subject of a term paper.

John W. Barnes was a private in the Confed-
erate army. Late in 18652 he was stationed near
Grenada, Miss., and during 1863 he took part
in the defense of Vicksburg. His letters
comment on camp life, rations, the welfare of

his friends, and inquiries about his crops and
affairs at home. He mentions the shooting of
deserters. He had only a limited education,
and was probably from the mountainous section

of Kentucky.

The collection deals with a law suit concern-
ing the estate of Richard Barnes, a wealthy tob-
acoo merchant and farmer of Culpepger county, Va.’
It seems that Rebecca Barnes, who married Jona-
than Beckwith, and Mary Barnes, who married
Younger Helsick, married against the wishes of
their father and did not receive a oroperty
settlement at the time of the marriage. On the

 
Barnes, Richard (2)
death of Richard Barnes, Beckwith and Helsick
Claimed the share which they felt belonged to
their wives. This was opposed by John Alexander,
who married Elizabeth Bafnes and Gerald Hove,
who married Sarah Barnes.

The collection is too scant to be of great
value. From the papers one is able to determine

 

the cause of the quarrel but whether all the
children shared equally in their father's estate
Cannot be determined. The statements of the

 
Barnes, Richard (3)

character witnesses and the information revealed
by the cross examination is interesting without
being especially valuable. One gathers that
Barnes possessed numerous slaves and a congider-
able amount of land, but the controversial nat-
ure of the material makes it impossible to use
it without supolémenting it with other less
prejudicial material.

Historical sketch. ,

The youngest son in a family apparently of
the English commercial aristocracy, Godfrey
Barnsley (b. ca. 1805, Peak, Derbyshire, England
brought the combined advantages of a classical
education and experience in a Liverpool commiss—
ion house to Savannah, Georgia (1824). As Americas

agent for Godfrey Barnsley, & Co., and Sager, Bro
&, Co., cotton and general import and export
brokers, he soon attracted a lucrative trade and

the people’ in Savannah, Mobile, New Orleans,
the upcountry of Georgia, besides maintaining
a frequent correspondence with brokerage firms
in New York and other Eastern cities.

Sometime in November 1828, Barnsley

married Julia, daughter of William Scarborough
of Savannah and Darien, Georgia. Over a period of

ten years, sven children Were born: Reginald
(b. May,1831; d. 1833); Anna (b. ca. 1832);
Harold (d.1858 ); George ( b. ? ); Adelaide

(d. October 1858); Julia( b. Jan.26,1837);

Lucian . 41 ). Constituting an intimate

but no small part of the collection is the
correspondence of these naive , well-meaning
children to a knowing , tolerant and ever-admonsi
ing parent; letters to each other, not only durii
the period of exuberant youth but also during the
grasping years of maturity; and detailed account

 

lists, amusing glimpses into Northern prep school
and Southern female academy life.

Barnsley possessed the means and dis—
position to provide his children with the

cultural prerequisites of their class and commun—
ity,favoring, according to English tradition, the
eldest son, Harold, and upon the latter's depart—
ure from America, George.

For approximately five years(1844-1849),
Harold Barnsley attended the preparatory school
of onéy Charles Greene, at Jamaica Plains, Mass—

achusetts. Indulging an urge to travel, he went
to sea in the fall of 1849, rounded ‘the Horn’,
‘left his ship at San Francisco, and arrived home

late in 1850, broken in health and in spirit. The

four years 1650-1654, he wasted either at Wood—
lands( the family estate ) or in a New Orleans
commission house. He left the Gulf port on Sept-
ember 16,1854, travelled north to Cincinnati, and
then eastward to New Bedford, Massachusetts, at 3
which place he signed articles for a whaling voy
age into the Pacific. When his vessel touched at
Manila,P.I., Harold began a two-year gkay resid—
enee, working intermittently as clerk in a general
store, and as assistant ship-—chandler. In 1856,

he could be found in Hong Kong,China, first en-

gaged in the routine duties of subordinate to a

government auctioneer, and later (1858) establish

ed im his own business as exporter and importer,

owner of at least two schooners. In the latter

year, the infrequent but lengthy letters cease.
Two years before Harold B. hadleft

New England for a seafaring existence, George and

Lucian Barnsley began an eight-year period (1846-
1854) of study at Charles Greene's. Upon their
return home in March 1854, George entered the

Second year class at Oglethorpe University from

 
he was graduated in July 1857.
As the youngest son, Lucian was given minor dutie
to perform in his father!s tsiness. Inflated by
his petty successes at the University, George re-
turned to Woodlands, and provoked both his par-
ent, and overseer by unwarranted criticisms and
unfortunate domestic transactions.

Entering the Eighth Georgia regiment upon
the first call to arms, George and Lucian survive
the engagement at Manassas. George soon became

up the atudy of medicine in Richmond. Lucian
wore the "grey" thoygughout the four years of
conflict.
After a brief excursion into Mexico in
1866, both boys attached themselves to a south—-
ern emigrant group bound for Brazil. Locating
in the district of Minas Geraes, their struggle

to gain a livelihood appears in a correspondence
covering the years,1867-1871.
Barnsley's three daughters were matricu-

lated at Montpelier Female Institute located

near Macon, Georgia. Unlike Adelaide and Julia
who attended Montpelier for at least eight years
(1846-1854), Anna returned, upon her mother's
death in 1845, to Woodlands .

Seldom able, or perhaps unwilling, t¢
grant himself even a short respite from a busine
which his English associates “left entirely to

fortune was lavished upon the development of this
retreat, which almost self-sufficing with its
slave( about 24) and white labor, blossomed into

stitutes the theme of an interesting corresponds

 

ence between Barnsley and John Connoliy, Irish
immigrant, and conscientious but not overly
energetic overseer who remained at Woodlands in

that capacity from December 1841- January,1858.

When Sherman's army encamped nearby in the fa

of 1864, the main buildings were still unfinished
Rather than expose his treasures, among which were
a table made for DéPedro II, and a gilt library
clock for Marie Antoinette, to the whims of an
invader, Barnsley, then at Woodlands, disposed of
them to unknown parties. It was at this time that

 

 

Julia wrote from Savannah(December 8,1864) : "I
have forgotten how to laugh." Barnsley departed
for Mobile and New Orleans to forget and to re-

coup his losses. To Julia , he left the custody
of Woodlands. Here the collection abruptly ends.

the probability of full scale war, and the
probable results of such a war.

Among the most interesting aspects of the
Barnsley collection is the picture of spiritual-
ism which is presented. Beginning in 185)
Godfrey Barnsley and his family were definitely
interested in seances and mediums. In 1867

 

a letter written by a medium for George Barns-

ley is in he papers. Godfrey Barnsley wrote

to his friend in Savannah, William Duncan, con-
cerning his adventures in Spiritualism.in the

period before the Civil War. Later, descendants

living at Barnsley Gar also had spiritualis-
tic experiences.

Barton, Clarissa Harlowe. Papers, 1869-1883
Washington, D. C.

 

Clara Barton (1821-1912) was named by her
parents Clarissa Harlowe Barton, but it was by
her shortened name that she became famous. Her
life of teaching, nursing, and Red Cross work
is treated in several biographies and a good

sketch in the D. A. B. (Vol. II, pp. 1d-21).

In Sept., 1869, she left for Europe to rest
and regain the strength she had expended during
the Civil War and postwar years. The diary

 
Barton, Clarissa Harlowe 2
included in this collection is a-record of her
experiences from Sept. 1 until Dec. 31. It
refers principally to her sojourns in Geneva
and Corsica.

After spending a few days in Scotland, Miss
Barton went to Geneva where she visited the
family of a young soldier whom she had nursed.
A clipping pasted in the front of this volume
states that she was delighted with Europe. The
diary, however, gives the reader a contradictor
impression. Miss Barton registers in it

 

 
Barton, Clarissa Harlowe 3
numerous complaints about the bad weather and
the physical discomforts to which she was sub-
jected during her travels. After spending three
months in Geneva, she decided to leave the rain,
cold, and fleas of that city for a less dreary
place in which to rest and write. She selected
Corsica and arrived there on Dec. 18. But she

 

again encountered an unpleasant climate and

unattractive living accomodations. The diary
ends on Dec. 31 when Miss Barton expressed the
hope that the next year would be one in which

 
Barton, Clarissa Harlowe 4
she could accomplish something and at least
complete the writing she had begun. The year
1370 did bring her new opportunities, for with
the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war, she
found an outlet for her renewed energy.

‘The diary contains few comments on the people
she met during her travels. Among the more

 

significant individuals whom whe mentions are
Clarence Horace Upton with whom she stayed in
Geneva when her previous quarters became too

unpleasant. Upton was U. S. consul in Geneva.

 
Barton, Clarissa Harlowe 5

 

In Corsica, she visited several times with Sir
Edwin Arnold, editor of the London Daily
Telegraph, and his wife Fannie Maria Adelaide
(Channing) Arnold, granddaughter of William
Ellery Channing. She also met Thomasina M.A.E.
Campbell whose book Notes on the Island of
Corsica (London, 1868) she “found too laudatory
of that island.

The records of Miss Barton's expenses during
her trip provide information on commodity
prices in Europe during 1869.

terms for G. A. R. engagements have been $75,
and that she is returning to Washington, D. C

Gertrude Williamson Baker was married to
Robert Thomas Barton on June 10, 1890. They
had two children: Robert Thomas Barton, Jr.
and Gertrude who married Arthur Maxwell Field.
Mrs, Barton was very active in women's work

in the Protestant Episcopal Church, especially
with the Junior Auxiliary. Many of the papers
comprising this collection concern her church
work at the local and state levels.

 
Barton, Gertrude Williamson (Baker) yA

Robert Thomas Barton, Sr. (1842-1917) was a
prominent lawyer in Virginia. His letters to
his wife refer to his professional affairs as
well as to personal matters. Rk. T. Barton, Jr.
was sent to the Mexican border in 1916 with his
unit of the National Guard. The elder Barton's
letters during that year contain comments on
the undetermined status of the Guard and Wood-
row Wilson's dilemma concerning clarifying this
issue without hurting his chances for re-

election.

 

 
Barton, Gertrude Williamson (Baker) ie
Mason Gaither Ambler discussed political and
financial affairs in West Virginia (March 24,
1910), while Robert Nicholson Scott Baker
commented on life at the U. S. Naval Academy
(Sept. 20, 1911) and his naval career (Feb. 9,
1917). Bishop Robert Atkinson Gibson's long
letter of March 12, 1915, contains an analysis

 

of a missionary project undertaken by his
diocese, Instructions for the performance of
one of her plays are included in a letter
written by Marie Elizabeth (Jeffries) Hobart

 
Barton, Gertrude Williamson (Baker)
(Feb. 3, 1908).

Among the printed material is an undated
pamphlet entitled Some Little Colored People
and Their Schools. Published by the Protestant
Episcopal Church, it notes the superiority of
missionary work to state programs in educating
southern Negroes.

 

 

 

Biographical information on R. T. Barton, Sr.

Ohio. 65 items & 1 yol Sketch 1

This is a collection largely of letters to
these two brothers-in-law. Several of the
letters are of particular interest.

A. R. McIlvain, a brother-in-law of these
two men and a member of the Pa. House of

 

Representatives, comments in a letter of
February 22, 1837 on the slow work of thet
House in taking care of the bills that have
come before them.

There are three letters from John C.Calhoun

 
Babton, Jesse and Mulvany, John R, 2

in 1837-9, In the first letter Calhoun says

he is sure he will be sustained by the whole
South and refers to the resolutions on the
subject of abolition that he has introduced in
Congress. The second letter contains a remark
by Calhoun about his own handwriting. The
third letter gives his opinion of the Whig
Party.

There are a number of letters pertaining to
Ohio politics. A letter of November 16, 1838,
from Benjamin Tappan requests Mulvany's support
in his campaign for U. S. Senator to succeed

 

 
Barton, Jesse and Mulvany, John R. 3
Thomas Morrig. A copy of Mulvany s answers to
questions proposed by a Committe of Democratic
members of the Legislature of Qhio indicates
that he favors the independent treasury bill
and the leading measures of the Administration,
but is opposed to modern abolition. Duff Green
pleaded in 1889 for the adoption of a U. S.

 

 

Bank "ss the great regulator of the currency."
e mentioned some demonstrations against
ackson and Thomas H, Benton. R. H. Miller, an

Ohio state Senator, wrote inj21845 about the

long session about to end and about the Whig

 
Barton, Jesse-and Mulvany, John R. 4
efforts to trample the Democrats of Ohio. Also,
a letter from Wm. P. Simpson in 1849 discusses
Ohio politics in general.

An item of interest to this period of U. S.
history ts a letter from P. H, Mulvany, an
ass't. surgeon in the U. S. Army during the
Mexican War, which gives some description of
life in Mexico and the military campaigns of
the war, Other interesting items are a pair
of letters from California in 1850 which give
some of the personal experiences of the gold
miners; they contain a good description of life

and conditions in that state.

 

Added 2-9-55:

Correspondence and papers of Jesse Barton

inst joining abolition societies, and comparing
Abolitionist and Whig viewpoints, in particular
on the question of the abolition of slavery in
the District of “ and in the territories

Oxford, Mass, 69 items. Sketch |

 

This collection, though small in number
of items, is interesting and valuable, especi-
ally for one interested in the development of
manufacture and trade before the Civil War,
in the trade carried on during the Civil War
between the lines in N. C. and Va., in the

treatment of Union men by the Union army in

N. C., and of prisoners in Norfolk, Va., in
the attitudes of both Confederate and Union
officers, in details of certain cavalry raids,
and in Clara Barton and her family.

 
Barton, Samuel R. 32
Stephen Barton, a captain in the militia,

moved, sometime before the outbreak of the

Civil War, from Oxford, Mass., to Bartonsville
N. C., where he bought timber and started the
manufacture and sale of plow handles and othe
lumber products. There are a number of items

 

dealing with his business, with contracts he
made with various companies, and with details
concerning a case in equity which was tried
before the Circuit Court of Southampton, Va.,
in 1858 and 1866 and before the Supreme Court
of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in 1862, in which

 
Barton, Samuel R.
Barton was the victor.

Stephen Barton, a loyal Union man, was
allowed to carry on trade between the lines.
He won the respect of both sides for his hon-
esty and fairness. But, while on a trip to
Elizabeth City, N. C., in 1864, he was ar-

 

rested by a Lieutenant Budd of’ the 20th N. Y.
Cavalry, his goods and money confiscated, and
he himself imprisoned and brutally treated in
Norfolk.

Barton's personal narrative, written in
Washington to Lt. Col. O. L. Mann on Mar. 6,

 
Barton, Samuel R. 4
1865, shortly before he died, gives a detailed
account of his experiences. Early in Apr.,
1865, all of his property in Bartonsville was
destroyed in a cavalry raid commanded by Capt.
George F. Dern of the 3rd N. Y. Cavalry.

Among the documents is an inventory of

 

Stephen Barton's estate.

Most of the items after 1865 deal with
the attempt of Samuel R. Barton, the son and
heir of Stephen Barton, to recover damages
for the burning of his father's property. In
this he was helped by his aunt, Clara Barton,

 
Barton, Samuel R, 5
the famous founder of the Red Cross, who had

been influential in the release of her brother
in his being brought to Waghington, and in the
trial before Gen. BenjaminfButler.of Lt. Budd
and one Isaac B. Hutchings / or Hutchens, a
detective who had been a companion of Lt.

 

Budd when Barton was arrested and who had,
with Budd, Kept some of the money taken from
Barton,

Among other efforts, Clara Barton got a
deposition in 1866 from Col. Joel R. Griffin
of the 8th Ga. “6 attesting Barton's

 
Barton, Samuel R. 6

integrity and supporting the cause of Samuel
R. Barton. This is one of many depositions
obtained over many years giving details of the
amount destroyed and its value. There are
others from various officers concerned with
the raid. One of the most interesting is

 

that of 1885 by Clara Barton» herself. There
are two printed copies of this and one in her
own handwriting. It not only describes her
brother's experiences but tells of her own
efforts in his behalf, especially with Gen.
Butler, and of her y of ever getting

 
Barton, Samuel R. 7
Justice after Butler's removal from Washingto

One of the most valuable parts of the letter

or deposition tells of her work for the wound-
ed.

 

The case dragged on for many years, fi-
nally listing the support of Ellen Spencer

Mussey, a prominent lawyer of Washington and
one of the founders, with Clara Barton, of
the Red Cross. As far as these records show,
the case was not settled.

In addition to these papers there are
others giving lists of goodswith their prices,

 
Barton, Samuel R. 8
accounts of various kinds with Samuel Barton,
a synopsis of the insurance business of the
S. R. Barton Company, various wills in which
Samuel Barton was executor or trustee, etc.

On the back of one statement about in-
surance is a note stating that Michael O'Brien
lost his right foot at the Battle of Cedar

 

Mountain, Aug. 9, 1862, and there is a later
list of 1901-1902 of the final settlement of
O'Brien's account.

One letter, written by E. Benton Frémont,
speaks of his father, Col. John Charles Fré-

 
Barton, Samuel R. 9
mont, and his reason for naming the Golden
Gate. Another letter of 1924, tells of a

visit to Death Valley and the mines in its
vicinity. ,,

 

Therdé,aiso two photographs, one of Ste-
phen Barton, and one of Samuel R. Barton,

which were transferred to the Picture File.
Aside from the names mentioned above
there are several others which appear in these
letters or documents. Clara Barton in 1885
speaks of Capt. J. Waldo Dewey, of the 25th
Mass. Regt., who was Chief Provost-Marshal in

 
Barton, Samuel R. 10
1864 of the Department of Va. and N. C., of
the kindness of Capt. Charles W. Flusser,
commander of the N. C. fleet, who was killed
in 1864 in the engagement between the U.S.S.
Miami and the Confederate ram Albemarle, and
of Lt. Col. George W. Lewis of the 3rd N. Y.

 

Cavalry, There is also a deposition of Jan.
4, 1866 by Col. Lewis.

Stephen Barton, in his letter of Mar. 6,
1865, speaks of Brig. Gen. George Foster Shep-
ley and of Col. Horace T. Sanders, later
Brig. Gen., both of whom seemed hostile to

 
Barton, Samuel R, as
him. He mentions also a James W. Pulford, a
Confederate soldier who had become a Union
supporter and who accompanied him to Elizabeth
City.

The Lt. Budd of the 20th N. Y. Cavalry,
discussed at length in the letters of Clara
and Stephen Barton, was probably Lt. Benjamin

 

C. Budd, a young man who became enadit. in
1863 and a lst 1t. on Feb. 1, 1864. The only
other Lt. Budd of the 20th N. Y. Cavalry did
not receive his lieutenancy until 1865.

In addition to those mentioned above are

 
Barton, Samuel R. 132
the signatures of Col. Franklin W. Kilpatrick

of the lst S. C. Regt. to a receipt for sup-
plies of Mar. 31, 1863; of Col. Horace T.
Sanders, who became a Brig. Gen. in 1865, to
a statement of Sept. 28, 1864, of the amount
of money taken from Stephen Barton; and sever-
al signatures of Lt. Col. Orrin L. Mann, who

 

was provost-marshal of the district of eastern
Va.

Among the correspondents are: Clara Bar-
ton, Samuel R. Barton, Stephen Barton, E.
Benton Frémont, Orrin i Mann, John R. Kilby,

 
Barton, Samuel R, _13
Franklin W. Kilpatrick, Ellen Spencer Mussey,
and Horace T. Sanders.

In his letter of March 6, 1865, Barton
reports a visit by three federal gunboats in
search of cotton. They are the Massasoit,
Thomas Collier, and Whitehead.

William Badkerville was a well-to-do plante
of Mecklenburg Co., Va. The earliest letters
in the set discuss the state of various crops

in that region especially tobacco, and mention
procedures for the curing of the latter.

this fertilizer in the United States. The
company's main operations were originally at
Philadelphia where its Delaware River Chemical
Works was located. A branch office was opened

 
Baugh & Sons Company

 

in 1888 at Norfolk, Virginia, and in 1903 the
Baugh Chemical Company was organized at Balti-
more, The Baugh Chemical Co. produced basic
agricultural chemicals, and Baugh & Sons Co, in
Maryland and Baugh & Sons Co. in Ohio distri-
buted those products in the mid-Atlantic states

and in Ohio and Michigan, respectively. The
combined annual plant capacity exceeded 600,000
tons, plants being maintained at Philadelphia,
Norfolk, Oneida, N.Y., Canton, Ohia and New
Bern, N.C, The company was considered the

 
Baugh & Sons Company _
largest amasser and grinder in the U.S, of
domestic and imported cattle bones, large
quantities being imported from South America.
In 1963 the Baugh Chemical Co.-was acquired

Copies of these sketches are filed with the
collection,

The collection consists primarily of photo-
graphs and of mats for advertisements or illus-
trations, There are also several printed

 

advertisements, three examples having been trans

ferred from the Advertising Collection.
Pictures that are dated are from the period of
1905 to 1932, but many are undated, Many of
the pictures were used in publications, and

 
Baugh & Sons Company 5
some of them are marked as having been in the
company's almanacs of certain years, Some of
the firm's publications are listed in The
National Union Gatalon. Some pictures and
printed material are large and have been filed
separately in an Oversize Folder.

Most of the pictures relate to the company

 

and to the use of its products, The pictures
include offices, factories, docks, machinery,
products, displays of products, personnel, deal-
ers, and farms. Photographs of crops are

 
Baugh & Sons Company

 

numerous, usually corn, potatoes, hay, and
tobacco. Farmers, workers, buildings, and
equipment are often part of the scenes. Farms
identified by place are usually in New Jersey
and Pennsylvania, with at least two from North
Carolina. Pictures of businesses who sold

fertilizer occasionally provide town or village
scenes, There are some pictures of families
and buildings in which the connection to the
company is not clear. Some of the factory
scenes are labeled for places, but the location

 
Baugh & Sons Company 7
of others is uncertain. There were extensive
facilities both at Baltimore and Philadelphia
and other plants elsewhere,

A list of all the pictures is in the Invento
File. Many pictures are numbered, usually on
their reverse sides, These numbers have been
used to organize the pictures.

Business and family papers of Thomas Baxter,
a commission merchant and businessman of Peters-
burg, Va. Most of the correspondence was writ-
ten during the 1850's and 1860's. Letters
prior to the war contain information on an un-

coUperative slave of the family, the secession
crisis, particularly in Virginia, and the re-
action of the Connecticut citizenry to the cri-

sis. Besides comments on civilian life during

 
Baxter, Thomas 2

the Civil War, there are descriptions of the
Confederate fortifications at Norfolk, Va., in
1861 and at Winton, Hertford Co., N. C., in
1862, comments on traitors in northeastern

N. C., the impressment of large buildings in
Greensboro, N. C., for eight hundred wounded
soldiers in 1864, and conditions in Plaque-

 

mines Parish, La. Following the war, many of
the letters contain information about Radical
Republicans in the South, black soldiers and

freed Negroes, and the schooling of T. H. Bax-

 
Baxter, Thomas 5
ter at Virginia Military Institute in Lexington,
Va.

The collection also contains fourteen news-
paper clippings of sayings and couplets,
several of which were written by Samuel H.
Marks, a businessman in Petersburg, Va., and a
commonplace book with entries dating from the
1820's and 1830's. There is one letter written
by George Wythe Randolph to Baxter in 1858.

The three letters of Sept.-Oct., 1861, to
Mary Baylor of Shepherdstown, Virginia (later
West Virginia), that constitute this collection
were written by E. R. Brown of North Mountain,

Virginia. Miss Baylor may have been the
daughter of Robert William Baylor (1813-1883)
of Jefferson County. See the Baylor family
sketch in J. W. Norris, ed., The Lower Shenan-

 

doah Valley ....

 

 
Baylor, Mary 2

 

Writing from Berkeley County, up the Potomac
River from Shepherdstown, Brown is concerned
about the condition of Miss Baylor's slave,
"William." William, Brown informs her, is in
the Hagerstown (Maryland) jail, and she should
go get him because his health could suffer from

the treatment slaves receive in that jail. The
second letter reports that William is still in
jail and will be sold within the next two weeks
to the highest bidder if he is not rescued.
Brown offers her assistance in crossing the

 
Baylor, Mary

 

Potomac through the lines between the Confeder-
ate and Union armies. The final letter is an
angry message in reply to an "impertinent"
letter from Miss Baylor. Brown announces that
William "may rot in the Hagerstown jail now
before I will do anything to help him." He

goes on to say that he did not value a Negro
as highly as she did although his father had
a large number of them and he was happy that
his family's wealth did not consist merely of

 
Baylor, Mary

 

Negroes. An envelope sent with the last
message bears a cartoon vignette of slaves
fleeing to Fort Monroe, Virginia, while a
Southern master dressed in a white suit and
with a whip attempts to stop them.

1787-1897. 1596 items and 1 vol. Sketch

 

The Alonzo Beardsley letters and papers
from Auburn, N. Y., are correspondence of the
law firm of Theotore Medad Pomeroy, William
Allen, and Alonzo G. Beardsley, formed about
1865. Various combinations of lawyers preced-

ing this firm have papers in the collection,
particularly John Porter. The most valuable
papers are those of T, M. Pomeroy, 1824-1905,
U. S. Congressman during the Civil War from
William Henry Seward's home town. They show a
cross. section of “o~ New York State com-

 
Beardsley, Alonzo 4G, 2
munity. A good picture of the workings of Re-
publican political patronage in New York is
given.

The letters begin in 1801 with those of
Thomas Masters. Most of this early group be-
long to John Porter of Auburn, attorney, judge,

 

 

state senator, and law partner of N. Y. Governor
Enos Thompson Throop. Assemblyman John McFadden
is involved in a suit over the sale of oxen.
The Porter letters merge about 1840 into those
of Attorney Wm. Allen, which give a picture of
social life and “eo Auburn covering

 
Beardsley, Alonzo G. 3
temperance, lectures on phrenology, and court-
ing. The Beardsley letters begin about 1842.
Allen, as Secretary of the Auburn Literary
Society, corresponds on Oct. 18, 1847, with
Professor Samuel Miles Hopkins of Auburn Theo-
logical Seminary concerning a lecture before

 

the society. Reference is made on Oct, 26,
1847, to a lawsuit iMvolving Alonzo Cornell,
Governor of New York. Letters of Amzi Wood,
partner of Alten, appear in 1848. Dr. Amariah
Brigham, head of the State Lunatic Asylum,
writes in Jan., “oO an accident

 
Beardsley, Alonzo G. 4
which prevents his giving testimony. Congress-
man Harmon S. Conger writes a business letter
on Jan. 320, 1849. Land litigation is evident
in Allen's increasing practice. He was agent
for the Camden Mutual Life and Fire Insurance
Co. in 1847-1849 and many insurance policies,

 

receipts, and papers continue through the
collection.

Charles Beardsley writes to Alonzo on Nov.
8, 1851, from New York City on law practice
there and on his library.

Letters from “6 Blatchford, New York

 
Beardsley, Alonzo G. 5
attorney of the firm of Blatchford, Seward,

and Griswold, begin Aug. 26, 1851, and continue:
with those of Clarence Armstrong Seward on
legal business through the fifties. About 1855
Allen joins Alonzo G. Beardsley, and from this
point the Beardsley papers continue in the col-

 

lection. Charles T. Porter comments on May 23,
1856, to Alonzo Beardsley on the assault on
Senator Charles Sumner, and foresees war, as
the Democratic party has sold itself "to the
devil." Business letters from the Eastern U. S.

are mumerous, “er collections,

mortgages, the Oswego Starch Co., and the manu-
facture and sale of agricultural machinery and
implements by Ross, Dodge, and Pomeroy.

The Pomeroy correspondence, giving an ex-
cellent picture of Cayuga County during the
Civil War, begins in 1861. It is notable for

 

details on political patronage in New York
during the sixties. Appointments and promo-
tions, civil and military, are numerous. Many

Sir Francis Beaufort (1774-1857), British
rear admiral, was the son of Daniel Augustus
Beaufort, geographer and vicar of Collon, Ire-
land. Sir Francis surveyed the entrance to the
Rio de la Plata in 1807 and the coast of Kara-
mania in 1811-1812. He was hydrographer to the

navy during 1829-1855.

An account book, 1796-1802, was kept by
Beaufort when he was a lieutenant on H. M. S.
Phaeton. His name does not appear on the

 
Beaufort, Sir Francis
volume. However, the Phaeton was noted, and
there is a reference on the first page to his
appointment as a lieutenant in May, 1796.
According to information in the Public Record
Office (ADM 36/11829), Beaufort was commissioned
on May 10 and is listed as third lieutenant in
the Phaeton's Muster Book for 1796. The other
lieutenants were appointed much earlier. The
volume also includes references to Collon
where his father lived.

The volume primarily includes accounts for

 

 
Beaufort, Sir Francis 3
1796-1799, but there are a few scattered later
entries. These accounts are his personal
financial records, and various personal and
professional expenses and items of income are
detailed. Of particular interest is the listing
of the considerable prize money that he re-
ceived from the capture of enemy vessels. His
purchases of books and also an account for the
“mess library" were itemized.

Erie during the War of 1812, to Secretary of
the Navy Benjamin Williams Crowninshield. wm,
Beaumont (1785-1853), famed American Army Sur-
geon and pioneer physiologist, had known Mac-
Donough during the War of 1812, had resigned
from the army in 1815, and now desired to re-
enter the service, this time in the navy. The
attempt was obviously unsuccessful, as Beaumont

One item added, 10-31-64. This is a report
of Gen. A.S. Johnston to Secretary of War Judah
Benjamin regarding the military situation in the
West as of February 8, 1862. Fort Henry has
fallen, and Federal operations against Fort
Donelson are to commence. Johnston has ordered
Gen. Hardee to make preparations to fall back to

 

Nashville to avoid being cut off from the south
bank of the Cumberland. Immediate withdrawal
from the line is deemed advisable. Johnston's
report is addressed from his headquarters at

Bowling Green, Kentucky.

l item added, 7-6-66: A letter, dated ca.
July 13, 1861, to Beauregard from Robert
Barnwell Rhett, Jr., editor of the Charleston
(S. C.) Mercury. Apparently, Beauregard had
written Rhett to protest the publication of
army intelligence information in the Mercury.
Rhett replied in this letter that the Mercury
was not read outside the Confederacy and that
even if copies did reach Union areas, their
arrival there would be so slow that any
intelligence information would be outdated.

This item was transferred from the Robert
Barnwell Rhett Papers.

1 item added, 9-11-66: an important letter
from General Daniel Harvey Hill to General
Pierre Beauregard. Hill, after a visit to
Richmond on May 9, 1864*, wrote to the commander
of the Confederate forces on the south side of

 

the James River to warn him of impending danger
for Petersburg. This remarkable forecast of
the movement of the Union Army was made five

weeks before General Grant appeared before
*June 9, 1864 (see card 29A)

 
Beauregard, Pierre Gustave Toutant 29

 

Petersburg; the armies were still fighting at
Spotsylvania north of Richmond. General Hill
analyzed Grant's reactions, the Confederate
forces which could be called upon for aid, and
stated he wished to save the country even if
he had to save "Mass Jeff" in the process.

On June 14, 1864, Grant surprised Lee by
appearing before Petersburg with his entire
army; Beauregard managed to hold his position
before the city against desperate odds until
help was finally dispatched to him.

 
Beauregard, Pierre Gustave Toutant 29-A
After a consultation with John M. Morgan of

the University of Toledo (Oct. 17, 1975), it
appeared that this letter was actually written
on June 9, 1864. Hill had not been to Richmond
by May 9, and he made a similar dating error

on a letter of June 10, 1864, now held in the
D. H. Hill Papers in the Southern Historical

 

Collection. See also O.R., Series I, Vol. 36,
part 3, p. 896 for continuity with a Hill
letter of June 11, 1864.

Watson Gilder, to decline to contribute to a
series on the great battles of the Civil War.

there, and the extent of the destruction and
pillage of Government property and report his
findings.

A letter of Apr. 3, 1867, from Francis D. Lee

 
Beauregard, Pierre Gustave Toutant

 

an architect of Charleston, S.C., who during the
Civil War served as a military engineer on
Beauregard's staff, gives Beauregard a brief
outline of his trip to France in Oct. 1866, wher
he met with the Minister of Marine, Emperor
Napoleon III, and M. De Lome, distinguished

naval engineer. His visit with the Emperor was
very satisfactory, and he told Beauregard that
the Emperor frequently alluded to him in a very
warm manner. He said the Emperor gave him the
impression that he preferred his designs over

 
Beauregard, Pierre Gustave Toutant

all others, but that later he was informed by
the Minister of Marine that the works then under
construction at the arsenals could not be re-
placed by his designs. His designs were re-
tained by the French Government, and he still
expected to be notified one day of their accep-

 

tance. He thanked Beauregard for his making
his trip to Europe possible. He said that be-
cause of the extreme poverty of the inhabitants
of Charleston there was no opportunity for him
to practice his profession there and that he

 
._Beauregard, Pierre Gustave Toutant 38

 

was to leave in a few days for Mobile, New
Orleans, and Memphis, seeking a location as an
architect. He settled in St. Louis later that
year.

A letter of June 7, 1867, from Gen. James
Longstreet to Beauregard is about their mutual

interest in a railroad venture in Mexico. lLong-
street asked Beauregard if his company could
help defray the cost of a trip to Mexico City
which he wished to make in the interest of their
railroad company. He wanted to join the U. S.
Minister to Mexico, “oe. D. Campbell, at

 
Beauregard, Pierre Gustave Toutant 39
Monterey and travel with him to the capital to
press their interest in securing a charter for
a railroad to run to Mazatlan.
