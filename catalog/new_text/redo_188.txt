The central character in this collection is
Archibald Erskine Henderson though many of the
letters were written by John H. D. Faimof Wil-
liamsboro, N. C., evidently a cousin of Archi-
bald Henderson, and Leopold Henderson,a brother.

Judmgge Leonard Henderson and great-grandson of

NorthkCarolina from 1859 to 1861, served throug
out the war in the Confederate army, taught
school ashort while after the war and practiced
law in Oxford, N. ©. and Yanceyville, N. C.

-His practice in Yanceyviglle must have lasted
for several years. The firm name was Dickey and
Henderson. Henderson was married December 18,
1873, but the letters do not reveal the name of

“his wife. There is evidence of T.J. Henderson 1

have been A. E. Hende gon's son.

Samuel Henderson was apparently from New
York. He served in the U. S. Army during the
Civil War and was captured during the Battle of
Cold Harbor, Va. on June 4, 1864, The item
constituting this collection is a copy made by
him of a diary that he kept while he was a pri-

soner at Andersonville, Ga., and at Florence,
S. C. He commented on living conditions, food
rations, and attempted escapes. Henderson
listed several men whom he helped in prison,

 
Henderson, Samuel 2
some of whom were from the 14th Regiment of New
York Heavy Artillery. He appears to have been
acquainted with these men before they were

captured and may have been a member of this
regiment himself.

The papers of George consist for the most

part of numerous conveyances of land in Wilkes
county, and of forms of legal documents which
undoubtedly served him as models in his office
of justice of the peace. The few documents

the ownership of which was disputed, and which

Hendrix was commissioned to survey. Approxi-

Anthony Jacob Henkel matriculated at the
University of Giessen in 1688, was ordained
in 1692, and emigrated to Pennsylvania in
1717, where he ministered to the Lutherans
until his death in 1728. His grandson,

Jacob, moved to Rowan (near Davidson) county,
N.C. where he lived until Indian depredation
drove him to West Augusta County, Va. (now
Pendleton County, W. Va.). His son, Paul,
the great Lutheran home

missionary of his generation, did not preach
his first sermon until he was in his twenty-
seventh year. Encouraged by the Rev. John
Andrew Krug of Frederick, Md., he decided to
study for the ministry and was ordained in
1792. He traveled through Virginia, North

Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Shia, and
Indiana preaching, f orming congregations, and
seeking pastors to take charges. He was one of

the founders of the N.C. synod in 1803, of the

 
Henkel Family

s
(3) Sketch

Joint Ohio Synod in 1818, and of the Tennessee
Synod in 1820. His residence in New Market, Va.
became a seminary in which he trained four of
his brothers and five of his sons for the
ministry. In his latter years his position was
that of a patriarch, a paralytic stroke forced

 

him to retire from active service in 1823, two
years before his death.
Henkel's sons continued his work. Solomon

(17727-1847), was a distinguished physician at

 
Henkel Family

(4) Sketch
New llarket. The other five were ministers.
Philip (1779-1833) and David (1795-1831) were
leaders in the Tennessee Synod; Andrew (1790-
1870) and Charles (1798-1841) of the Joint Synod
Of Ohio. Amnrose (1786-1870) combined preach-
ing with printing. In 1806 he and Soloman

 

established at “ew Market the first Lutheran
publishing house in the United States. ‘+t
contahued in existence for over a century,

supplying Southern Lutherans with books and

 
Henkel Family

(6) Sketch

 

and periodicals. ‘he greatest undertaking was
the first English translation of the Christian
Book of Concord, or ~ymbolical Books of the
Evangelical Lutheran hurch. Philip's sons,
Eudebius and lrenaeus, and David's sons,
Polycarp Cyprian and Socrates, became prominent

 

 

clergymen and leaders in the Tennessee Synod.
The Henkels were noted for their orthodoxy and
bitter opposition to the General Synod. With

them begen the confessional movement which

 
Henkel Family 6

 

ultimately spread through almost the whole
Lutheran Church in America.

The collection contains notes for sermons,
account books, and notes for articles and
lectures of various sorts. These are in German.
In addition to this the collection contains
the correspondence of the Henkel family,

covering the period 1812 to 1910 (See inventory
in the Inventory File. ). The early letters
are for the main part addressed to Solomon
Henkel and deal with the printing business at

New Market.

The yearly meeting of of the synod was an event of
importance - looked forward to with expectation
and diseussed long afterwards. The denomination
which the Lutherans feared most was the
Presbyterian, which ran them a close race in
Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee Valley.
Socrates succeeded Ambrose as head of the family
the printing business, and editor of the
Lutheran Standard. Polycaro “yprian and his son

served as chaplains in the Confederate army and

Henley, David Letters. 1791-1860

Washington, D. C. Sketch. 47 pieces

- David Henley was born in Charlestown, Mass.

on Feb. 12, 1748 and died in Washington, D. C,
on Jan. 1, 1823. He was appointed brigade-major
to Gen. Heath on Aug. 5, 1775 and on Jan. 8, 1776

crossed from Cobble Hill and set fire to the

 

houses in Charlestown that were occupied by
British soldiers. He was made deputy adjutant-
general on Sept.6,1776 and commissioned codbdnel
of a Mass. regiment on Jan.1,1777. He was in

command at Yambridge when the troops that had

Henley, Yavid

been captured at Saratoga were brought thither.
Gen. Burgoyne brought charges of cruelty against
him: for his treatment of the British prisoners,
but he was exofnerated by a court-martial.
After the war he held various government

 

positions, and at the time of his death he was
a clerk in the war department. From 1791 to
1800, at least, he was agent of war and in
charge of Indian affairs in Tennessee.

The David Henley papers form an@ exceptionally

valuable collection of manuscripts, concerni
the period 1791-1800. It seems that the Crees
were the most hostile to the whites and that
the Yhoctaws possessed qualities, which
Benjamin Hakins believed if properly directed,

 

would convert the tribes into an agricultural
people. *he letters contain a great deal about
the exchnge of prisoners, reparations for
murders and inroads of both whites and Indians,
compensation for stolen horses, the attempts

of the commissioners for Indian; affairs to keep
the whites from making inroads on the Indian
villages, and encouraging the trade between the
Indians and the whites. The settlers in East
and middle Tennessee were very anxious to

 

establish a post road to the South Carolina
border and to Natchez and to make it possible
for the travellers to journey in comparative
safety. The whites were particulary interested

in establishing a trading post at Muscles Shoals

which was outside their territory. One of the
most valuable sections of the collection is that
dealing with the establishment of the Indian
treaty line ers the Kentucky trace to the
gaps of the Cumberland and along Campbell's line
to the Clinch. The commissioners were beset ~'

 

with difficulties and with the compaints of the
whites who would be on the Indian side of the
line. The collection contains letters from

information it contains on Indian affairs and
on the personality and character of some of the
leading men connected with the early history of
the state of Tennessee.

When this collection was recatalogued,
several items were transferred to the William
Augustine Washington Papers. At the same
time, items from the former Revolutionary
Collection and from the Virginia County

Papers were transferred to the Henry MSS.
The items in the Henry Papers are a

miscellaneous lot including two commissions

for John Middleton (June 24, 1785; Aug. 10,

 
Henry, Patrick 2

 

1786) and one for Thomas White (Aug. 5, 1777).
Land grants signed by Henry are for William
Duvall (Oct. 20, 1786), Daniel Literal (Apr. 17,
1786), and John Stogdell (Sept. 20, 1786).

The Duvall land grant was originally a part

of the Don Preston Peters Collection. The
Literal grant was formerly catalogued in the

Virginia County Papers, and the White
commission was transferred from the Revolutimary
Collection.

Among the three letters is one from David

 
Henry, Patrick 3

 

Mason to Henry (May 13, 1779). Writing from
Charlotte Town (now Charlotte), N. C.,
Mason explained that a report sent by Mason
had not been delivered to Henry because, so
the messenger maintained, General Moultrie
had stopped its delivery. Mason informed
Henry of the progress of his march to S. C.
and the number of men and equipment under his
command.

On Oct. 20, 1785, Henry sent a printed
circular letter to the members of the Court

 
Henry, Patrick 4

 

of Pittsylvania County, Va. The letter
concerns the administration of taxes and
pensions in Va.

In an undated printed letter addressed
to Joseph Lewis de Beaulieu, Henry listed

Robert R. Henry was born before 1789 and
reared in Albany, N.Y., the son of __ Henry
and his wife Elizabeth (Vernor). He entered
the mercantile business as a member of the
firm of Vernor and Henry in Albany, and upon

the failure of the business he moved to St.

Mary's, Ga., in 1818. His children remained

in Ga., Charles Seton Henry becoming a Judge
of the Supreme Court of the Eastern Distriet
of Ga. His three daughters, Charlotte 8.,

 
 

went. Robert R. 2
Isabella S., who married Dri: John H, Hardee,

and Francis S. who married John N. Lewis, all
resided in Savannah, Ga. Robert Henry's papers
fall into three divisions from three places:
St. Mary's, 1822-24: New York City, 1824-ca.
1832; Lancaster, Pas, 1833-1840, He was resid-

ing in Savannah in 1847.

In 1822, while living at st. Mary's,
Robert R. Henry noticed irregularities in the
revenue service as administered by the Collec-
tor of the Port, Archibald Clark. Henry

 
Henry, Robert Re 3
gathered character recommendations from N.Y.
from DeWitt Clinton, Martin Van Buren, Eliph.
Nott, Robert Troup, State Senator Ambrose
Spencer of Albany, John Taylor, and his brothe
John Vernor Henry. He wanted the post of
Collector at St. Mary's, and opened his

 

campaign with Wm, Harris Crawford, Secretary
of the Treasury,and Henry Clay, Speaker of

the House, copies of whose letters to Henry
are in th papers. He also sent news of revenue
malpractiées. (presumably including smuggling

 
Henry, Robert R, 4

and illegal deals in Negpoes) to Representative
Daniel Cook, James McLean, Andrew Jackson, and
President James Monroe. He began to make
Charges against W.H. Crawford as wellas
Archibald Clark. Evidence was sent Jan. 7
1824, from Albany, N.Y. to J. Q. Adams,

 

>

Secretary of State. Henry sent a memorial to
the House of Representatives through Henry
Clay. Presumably investigations by Crawford
thru Mr, Hatbersham of Ga. and then by a
district attorney of Ga. were made. The recorée

 
Henry, Robert R, 5.
were carefully “kept by Henry, but there is much
repetition in the various letters and memorial¢
giving rise to confusion,

About 1828 Robert Henry begins his second
set of accusations after he has been made
Inspector of Potash and Pearlashes in N.Y. 6ity

 

He writes to Assemblyman Benjamin F. Butler,
Sept. 11, 1828, referring to the illness of
Ambrose Spencer, needed changes in inspection
laws, and other irregularities. By 1830 he is
sending a long memorial to Andrew Jackson,

 
Henry, Robert R. 6
attacking Martin Van Buren and N.Y. Governor

Enos Throop as well as Geo. Seamen, Inspector
General of Potash and Pearlashes, for polit-

ical favoritism, frauds, etc. Many letters go
to N.Y. Assemblyman and Robert Lennox, Presi-
dent of the Chamber of Gommerce. In an unbound

 

volume of copies of letters, 1831-32, Henry

gives two letters written by Wm. Harris Craw-
forion Nov. 10, 1821, and on Sept. 1, 1823, 1
which Crawford explains about investigations
of the Henry charges, Crawford angrily tells

 
Henry, Robert R, 7
Henry that Rresident Monroe and Crawford are
not being separated as politigal friends by
Henry's tactics.

On May 26, 1831, Henry begins to mention
"Tammany Society" and the "Regency" as invol-
ved in the inspection service in New York.

 

Attacks are made on Martin Van Buren. About
1831 Henry also begins to write about flour
and meal. He states he is compounding a book
inwhich he will expose Van Buren, Enos Throop,
Wright, Bronson, etc, Finally he attacks

 
Henry, Robert R, _&
Jackson, to whom he has sent a long memorial
in 1830, Henry tries to get his charges
placed before the grand jury in New York.

On Feb, 24 and Mar. 5, 1832, again in
Savannah, Henry launches an attack on Ven
Buren and advocates Henry Clay for Presidant.

 

The estate of Benjamin Vernor of Lancas-
ter, Pa., concerns the remaining papers, in
which Henry is chiefly occupied in pressing
_ suit against the executors in behalf of his
cousin, Mary mw ¥ the Isle of Man.

has given the death blow to abolition, that
Christ did not disapprove of slavery, that the

institution exists by the dispensation of
Providence, and that the end of slavery would
shake the whole civilized world to its very

Herron, Ima Honaker. Papers. Dallas, Texas

 

Ima Honaker Herron, professor emeritus of
American literature from Southern Methodist
University, Dallas, Texas, was born in Farmers-
ville, Texas, March 9, 1899. Her forebears
had been pioneers to Collins County, Texas, in

the early 1850s;, sturdy, independent folk in-
fluential in settling the town of Farmersville
and in establishing Methodist churches. Her
parents and grandparents were booklowers and
the joy of learning was instilled in each child

 
Herron, Ima Honaker
and grandchild. Two sisters and a brother like
Ima became teachers.

Ima Herron graduated from Farmersville High
School and entered Kidd Key Junior College.
Upon completion of its program in 1919 she
entered S outhern Methodist University having
won one of its coveted scholarships. She

 

received her B.A: degree in 1921. After some
graduate work at the University of Chicago

she returned to Southern Methodist University
and completed her Master's work in 1926. She

 
Herron, Ima Honaker 3
studied under Jay B. Hubbell both at SMU and
at Duke University where she received her
Ph.D. degree in 1935.

She began her teaching career at Farmers-
ville High School in 1921. Two years later
she returned to Kidd Key Junior College as an
Instructor in English. In 1925, she became

 

Head of the English Department there. In

1927 she transferred to S.M.U. as an Instructo
in English. She remained at SMU becoming a
full professor in 1946 and departmental Chair-

 
Herron, Ima Honaker 4

 

man during 1951-1953. In 1962 she was named
E. A. Lilly Professor of American Literature,
a chair she held until her retirement in 1964
when she was honored with the title Professor
Emeritus. She was a very respected, enthusias-
tic, and exacting scholar and teacher who in-

stilled a love of learning and a sense of
scholarship into her’pupils. In 1955 she won
the Outstanding Professor Award. At that time
she was the only woman to have received that
award. She was also given the Alumni Associa-
tion's Faculty Achievement Award in 1962 and

 
Herron, Ima Honaker

 

its Woman of Achievement Award in 1965.
Although not a "Woman's Libber" she gained
early recognition as a professor of merit
among her male colleagues.

The Ima H. Herron papers consist of two
letters; two manuscript articles paying

tribute to Jay B. Hubbell and Ernest Erwin
Leisy, both pioneers in the teaching of
American literature; reprints of Herron
articles, and clippings and reports pertain-
ing to Southern Methodist University. The

This very interesting journal of a northe
school teacher describes her life in Virginia
as a teacher from, Oct. 1854, to June 1, 1855,
in the family of Bishop Wm. Meade at his home,
"Mountain View," near the Shenandoah River at

 

the western base of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
"Miss Alma" was probably a member or relative
of the Hibbard family from around Troy, N.Y.
(See pp. 23 and 45 of the journal). She had
lost two brothers by 1855. No other personal
details are given in tyediary. It is notable

 
Hibbard 71, Alma 2

for the detailed description of the household
of Bishop Meade, for the picture of Virginia
social life, and for the reaction of this
northerner to southern civilization. Miss Alma’
emotions develop from wonder &bt the strange

way of life to anger at "shiftlessness" and
lack of discipline. The last pages reveal a con

 

firmed abolitionist returning Morth.

The household at "Mountain View" consisted
of "Mrs. M.ceade)," "Mr, M.ceade)," the Bishop,
and many grandchildren. "Mountain View" was the
home of the three Meade sons, Philip N., Richarn

K., and Francis Burwell; and after the death
of Mrs. Mayy (Randolph) Meade in 1836 , "Mrs.
M.ceade2," a daughter-in-law, became the mis-
tress of the family. She was either the wife
of Francis Burwell or Philip Nelson Meade. The
children mentioned by Miss.,Alma include Molly,

 

Lucy, Clara, Sisie, Betteg Miss Ann, Henrietta,

Virginia food, meals, and a slaughtering receiv
much attention. "Mountain View" is pictured
with its gardens and magnificent trees, as are
the surrounding mountains, Berry's Ferry.on the

copal chapels to which the family drove for
services. The neighboring ladies who called
and the treatment of hired "blacks" receive
frequent mention. Miss Alma collects many
botanical specimens, She observes the cattle
drivers and the mountaineers as they pass.

 

While she accuses Mrs. Meade of whipping the
"blacks}' Miss Alma whips the Meade children.

Of interest is her description of Virginia
people and places. What at first glance was an
easy going, free, gossipy.neighborhood becomes

the Lord Fairfax estate, "Greenway Court," are
carefully noted,

Hickey, John Joseph. Memorandum Book, 1837-
1876. Jefferson County, Virginia, and Perryville
Perry County, Missouri

 

This memorandum book, 1837-1876, was kept
by a young lawyer, John Joseph Hickey, who
lived in Jefferson County, Va., in the vicinity
of Middleway (Smithfield) near Charlestown.

He was related through his wife Sally to Dr.

Samuel and Sarah P. Scollay. Members of the
Scollay family are mentioned throughout the
memorandum book. From 1837 ’to 1842 he practiced

law in Jefferson and adjacent counties in Vir-

 
Hickey, John Joseph 2

 

ginia. By Jan. 1, 1543, he had moved to Perry-
ville, Perry County, Missouri, near the Missis-
Sippi. Evidently the family was back in Va.
before 1860, and John J. Hickey became a mere
chant by the 1870's. His accounts are kept in
blank spaces in the memorandum book.

In 1838 his journal reveals his activities
in various courts held in county seats. Many
local residents are mentioned: Charles James
Faulkner, Anthony Kennedy, Thomas Timberlake,
Wm. B. Craighill, Wm. McSherry, Thomas Griggs,
et al. Much local news from fire companies to

 
Hickey, John Joseph

parties is noted. Hickey was reading extensively
in the law and in literature. On Feb. 29, 1839,
the Van Buren followers in Jefferson County held
a large meeting to elect delegates to the
Democratic Convention in Richmond. Hickey at-
tended this meeting in March as a delegate.
Judge [Henry St. George] Tucker was elected
chairman and many local politicians attended.

 

Hickey mentions Randolph Harrison, James Garland,
Thomas Ritchie, Langdon Carter, and Judge
Richard E. Parker.

Hickey notes in some detail the lecture of

 
Hickey, John Joseph 4
Ambrose Cramer on Sabbath School teaching, re-
lating a “laughable” anecdote of Dr. Benjamin
Rush.

The Missouri jeurnal begins on Jan. 1, 1843,
and mentions Hickey's wife Sally and two sons
John William and Joseph. The Hickeys were liv-
ing in a log house on a farm near Perryville,
where Hickey had started a law practice. Im this

 

section of the memorandum book (pp. 57, 59, 60,
62, 63, 64, 70, 72, 115) E. M. Holden, another
lawyer receives frequent and unfavorable mention

by Hickey. There is some mention of the Scol-

 
Hickey, John Joseph 5
lays and the sale of a printing office.

The remaining pages have brief sections of
a notebook (promissory), accounts, a letterbook,
docket books, and miscellanea from Virginia and
Missouri, See also a brief description of St.
Genevieve, Missouri (p. 59).

These are the letters and napers of Edward
Brodnax Hicks (d. 1858), Virginia lawyer, and
of his'son, David S. Hicks, Virginia lawyer,
planter, and land agent. The earliest Letters
to Edward B. Hicks are eddressed to him in

Mecklenburg Vounty, Va., but in 1813 he moved
to Brunswick County, whick place is the locale
of the remainder of the set. Vari9us items,
such as receints for Jockey Club dues, in-

dicate Edward's interest in race horses, which
interest is also indicated in the papers of
David S. Hicks. In 1821 Edwaré was the sheriff
of ’Brunswick County, and +m 1847 the Superin-
tendent of the Brunswick County Schools. His
interests were not all confined to that commun-

ity however; for in 1837 and for the next few
years, he was a partner in a plantation on
the Red River Arkansas, the resident nartner
being John W. Paup. He was also engaged in

 
Hicks, E.B. and D.S. Card 3

 

1852 in selling slaves in New Orleans.

There are ,two or three rather interesting
letters included in ‘the Edward B. Hicks mat-
ertal. One (Sept. 30, 1812) 1s from Lewis L.
Taylor, a captain in the War of 1812, written

while on his way with his men to Canada to
engage the British. Another, written in 1817
from Thomas W. Jones, and tells of the dis-
turbance caused at Princeton by the refusal of

 
Hicks, E.B. and D.S. Card 4.

 

the professors to take date Bank Notes. The
most continuous piece of corresnondence in the
whole set 1s that between Edward B. and John
Paup concerning their Arkansas land. Edward
died th 1858 survived by Rebecca, his daughter

and David S., his son.

The collection for that year 1s centered
in David S* Hicks, who was executor of his
father's estate. It is largely a mass of

 
Hicks, E.B. and D.8. Card

 

legal documents, correspondence, and notes,
in which are embedded from time to time with
cursory bitsof social corrsenondence. The
most continuous sertes here is the set of
letters from Leigh Page, a Richmond attorney.

David S, Hicks seems to have taken over his
father's law prautice. In 1870 he was engaged
with on€Turnbull 1n selling Brunswick County
land to Yankees and there 1s some correspondence

on this matter,

In 1878, David S. became the county judge
of Brunswick County. and in the same vear
the set shows hit as a partner in the Bruns-
wick Land Company, engaged in land negotiat-
fons in Texas. In 1896 he was made trustee

of this conpany, having all the land it owned
put in his charge. There is some consider-
able corresnondence in 1888-89 concerning

president. There are fifteen letters from
General Ewing. David S. had at least three
children, Rowena, Bessie, aid David S. Jr.,
whowas in 1894 engaged with Thomas B. Price

in the lumber business in Lawrenceville.

The most interesting letter 1s the David 8S.

cerning the Southern Negro Congressmen and
his hatred of them, as wel) as the Negro
Supremacy which he saw inevitable for the
South.

Included in this set are 13 volumes,

only four of rs can be definitely ident-
ified as Hick material. These are two
dav books of gah B. Hicks, 1821-28. There

is also an account book (evidently of a tan-

into the possession of the Kicks family

the legal practice of either Edward or David

On April 29, 1856, Rep. John A. Quitman of
Mississippi made a notable speech in which he
advocated repeal of the U. S. neutrality laws.

His speech was printed with an appendix as a
pamphlet in 1856, and one of these pamphlets

is in the Hicks Papers. The appendix consists
of a letter, dated April 25, 1856, to Quitman
from William L. Cazneau who negotiated a treaty
between the U. S. and the Dominican Republic

are also programs of the commencement exercises
at several schools. Several generations of

Monteagle, Grundy Co., Tenn,

 

The Highlander Folk School, which began in
1932, was chartered two years later as a general
welfare institution, The name "Highlander" was
chosen because it denotes Appalachian, referring
to the area in which the school is located. Don

West and Myles Horton were the founders of this
institution and in 1952 it was still headed by
Horton,

The school was primarily an educational

 
Highlander Folk School

 

institution providing courses for workers, which
included practical training in conducting the
affairs of a union, and workshops. Other ser-
vices were offered, though, such as camps as well
as extension and community work, for example a
nursery school, Recreational facilities were
also available, Eventually Highlander Folk

School became the Highlander Research Center, a
civil rights institution,

This microfilm contains material, both printed
and typescript, filmed from the Highlander Folk

William A. Hightower was the son of Joshua
Hightower who was probably a planter.
1859 and 1860 William was a student at Randolph-
Macon College. His sisters were enrolled in the
Danville Female College. Most of the letters
concern William's college life. He seemed to
be a serious minded boy and a good student.
Probably early in 1861 he left school and jotned
the Confederate army. His letters henceforth
show him on the marchand engaged in various

 
HIGHTOWER, William A Sketch (2)

skirmishes which he, however, looked upon as
major battles. For a time at least he was among
the troops under "Stonewall" Jackson's command.

phy from Uppsala University in 1898 and then was
a professor there. He was a contributing editor

for the Stockholm Dagbland, and in 1904 became
its editor-in-chief. After becoming a member
of the legislature in 1910, he expressed a mod-
erate viewpoint and supported laws concerning
freedom of the press and tobacco monopolies,

He held various positions in the legislature

Adams Sherman Hill was born in Boston in
1833. He was baptized Abijah Adams, but on act
of the legislature legally changed his name to
Adams Sherman, incorporating his mother's maiden
mame and his father's given name. He received

both undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard
and went to New York to practice law. In 1856,
however, he entered the field of journalism and
held positions with several newspapers for a

 
Hill, Adams Sherman 2
number of years. He was appointed to the fac-
ulty of Harvard as an assistant professor of
rhetoric in 1872 and from 1876 until his retire-
ment in 1904, he was Boylston Professor of Rhet-
oric and Oratory there. He published several
books in this field before his death in 1910,

 

He married Caroline Inches Dehon in 1868,

Hill's papers relate exclusively to his car-
eer aS a newspaper correspondent. Several of
the earlier items pertain to his job in the

home offices of the New York Tribune. Included

 

 
Hill, Adams Sherman 3

among them are a letter from Sarah Moore Grimke
concerning an article by her brother and others
from friends in Boston and elsewhere,

After the outbreak of the Civil War, he went
to Washington where he reported on war news.
Charles Anderson Dana and Sydney Howard Gay of
the Tribune staff in New York wrote to him to

 

send instructions concerning his articles. Hill
and other Tribune correspondents faced stiff
competition in gathering news, and the letters

sent from New York and later from Chicago con-

 
Hill, Adams Sherman 4
tained advice or criticism related to the con-
tents or dates of the dispatches sent from the
field. He appears to have cultivated contacts
within the government and military commands, and
letters from these men are marked "private" be-
cause of their confidential references,

Finding it difficult to restrain himself from

 

including in his dispatches comments contradic-
tory to the views adopted as the editorial pol-
icy for the Tribune by Horace Greeley, Hill re-

signed from the staff of this newspaper in: De-

 
Hill, Adams Sherman S
cember, 1963, and became a correspondent for the
Chicago Daily Tribune. About this time, he was
involved with Whitelaw Reid in a project that
appears to be related to documents to which they
were hoping to obtain access. His correspon-
dence with Reid concerns this matter. Letters
from Joseph Medill, Horace White, and Henry

 

Villard discussed his articles for the Chicago
paper. In 1864, he began to write for papers
in Massachusetts and received letters from

Samuel Bowles and Charles Hale in reference to

this association.

 
Hill, Adams Sherman af 6

A personal Letter from William Eaton Chandle
later to become Secretary of the Navy, speaks of
his family in Concord, New Hampshire (November
16, 1863). One from Schuyler Colfax refers to
political affairs, and a number of letters com-
ment on matters other than Hill's journalistic

 

responsibilities. Horace Greeley is often cri-
ticized for his personal and political views,
and Lincoln's administration was unpopular with
Hill and several of his correspondents.

This collection consists of a letter from
Gen. A.P. Hill to Carrie Redfield (Apr. 30,
1856). The letter is a very friendly one in
which Gen. Hill mentions many people with whom
Miss Redfield was acquainted. In 1862, Miss
Redfield wrote several comments on this letter,
including the comment that "Nellie" (Mary Ellen)
Marcy, who later married Gen. George B. McClella
was persuaded by her parents to decline a pro-
posal of marriage made by Gen. Hill.

Papers, 1831-1937

(Entered in the National Union Catalog of
Manuscripts as Hill, Hiram.)

 
Hill, Hiram and Otis G. Papers, 1831-1937.
Williamsburg, Hampshire Co., Mass.

 

The letters of this collection consist
primarily of the correspondence of the various
members of the Hill family, whose basic seat
of resi@ence was in and near Williamsburg, Mass.
Of the older generation there were two brothers,

Hiram, and Otis G.. The principal correspondents
of the second generation were the children of
Otis. G., one daughter Myra, and five sone:

Hiram Jr., Melvin, Henry, Arthur, who sends let-

ters home while attending Wilbraham Academy,

 
Hill, Hiram and Otis G. ee
and John, who also attended several schools,
with most of his letters coming from New Haven.
The most interesting letters, however, are
those passing between thebrothers of th older
generation. They seen to have had much in
common, their dairy farms perhaps adjoining each
other, and were often managed by jotmt counsel
and supervision. But in business and financial
matters they evidently had even more in common.
They must have had at their disposal considerable
funds, which Hiram undertook to secure profitably

for the future, making long and repeated journeys

 

 
Hill, Hiram and Otis G. -
throughout the Middle West, placing investments
primarily in real estate, consisting of new
farm land and town lots. Unfortunately some of
his letters on this adventure, written in the
middle 1850's, were not preserved. But some
years later there come letters from various
representatives and agents, who send in their
reports from such cities as Mansfield, Ohio;
Bement, Ill; Lawrence, Kansas; and various places
in Minnesota and Iowa.

In later years, the early 1870's, their main

investments were made in eastern banks and

 

 
Hill, Hiram and Otis G. A Se 4
midwestern railroads, especially the Logansport,
Crawfordsville and Southwestern Railway Co.
While the letters of the earlier period give
considerable information of things pertaining to
rural life, both in Mass, and the Middle West,
these later letters throw considerable light

on the ominous fluctuations and losses in the

 

business world during and immediately after the
nationwide panic of 1873. From the scant evi-
dences in the letters it would seem that the
Hill interests fared relatively well during

this financial upheaval.

 
Hill, Hiram and Otis 5

With regard to things of national interest,
including the Civil War and Reconstruction,
there is little that is worth mentioning. In
the spring of 1857, when Otis G. Hill represented
his district in the state legislature at Boston,
the essions became long and tedious. On Feb. 14
in his usual Sunday evening letter, this time
to his brother Hiram, he casts half-humorous
and half-bitter aspersions on the action of the
legislature, claiming that like Peter, it was
toiling all night but catching no fish and
perhaps the next astoundingfhing it would do
would be to re-elect Sumner to the Senate.

 

 
Hill, Hiram and Otis 6

 

The legal papers include: Will of Susanna
Hadlock, spinster, of Rockingham Co., New Hamp-
shire, which bequeathed her estate to her son
Jacob Hadlock; will of I. Wealthy Thayer of
Williamsburg; contracts; bonds; deed to Hiram
G. Hill for land he purchased in Williamsburg
Co.; and a document relative to a suit for
divorce by Charlotte M. Hill vs. Hiram G. Hill.

The printed material contains an official
program of the International Congress of Free-
thinkers which met in Chicago in 1893, and a

series of letters written by an unidentified
traveler in Japan in 1887.

HILL, Joel Edgar Letters 1872-1910
Stokes County, N. C, 267 pieces
Joel Edgar Hill was the son of Jacob F, Hill
of Wilson's Store, Stokes Co., N.C. Besides Joel
Edgar there were seven other children, Lou, Car-
rie(d. 1893), Frank, W. Lee, Fannie, James H.,
and Robert. All the ietters are addressed to
Joel E, and were written by his fabher, his
brothers and sisters, or by girls who were m1ld-
ly interested in him, In 1887 Joellived in Wash-
ington, D.C., and was apparently mail clerk on

the Southern railway.

 

The most interesting let-

 
ters of the collection are those written by the
father, suggesting that Joel E, see Z.B.Vance

or Ransom about a government position. The let-
ters comtain some rather acute political obser-
vations. Jesse Walling of Washington wrote nu-
merous letters some containing comments about
Julia Marlowe in Ignomar (jan. 19, 1891) and Jo-

seph Jefferson in Heir at Law (Dec. 20,1891).
W. Lee Hill studied medicine at the College
of Physicians and Surgeons, Baltimore (1892), He

was piysician for a time for the iron works at

 
HILL -3-
Cranberry, N. C., and later at Lexington and
Arcadia,

About 1896 Joel E, left Washington and appar~
ently taught school at Arcadia. The letters of
this section are of little practical value. One
Maude [ i, a student at State Normal
and Industrial College, Greensboro, N. C., tells
of hearing Dr. J. C. Kilgo preach (Mar. 8,1901).

John Kenna Hillers (1843-1925), one of Ameri-
ca's most important early photographers, was
born in Hanover, Germany, and came to the U.S.
in 1852. He served in the Civil War. Resigning
from the U.S. Army in 1870, he traveled to the
West where he joined the John Wesley Powell
Expedition in 1871. His career in photography
began on this expedition, and he became Powell's
photographer-in-chief in 1872. Hillers worked
the rest of his life for the Powell Survey, the
Bureau of Ethnology, and the Geological Survey.

 
Hillers, John Kenna 2

He was chief photographer of the Geological Sur-
vey from 1881 until his retirement in 1900, and
he continued on a part-time basis until 1919.

He was the first man to photograph the Grand
Canyon and most of the high plateaus of central
and southern Utah. During his career of twenty-
nine years he made several thousand negatives of
anthropological and geological subjects, many of
which are deposited in the National Archives and
in the Smithsonian National Anthropological
Archives in Washington, D.C. The Denver Public
Library has a large collection of Hillers' pho-
tographs and stereographs. He was an artist and

 

 
Hillers, John Kenna 3
an excellent craftsman. For biographical infor-
mation see: John K, Hillers, "Photographed All
the Best Scenery," Jack Hillers's Diary of ‘the
Powell Expeditions, 1871-1875 (Salt Lake City,
1972), pp. 9-13, 17.

This collection includes 40 photographs,
albumen prints. Thirty-three are landscapes of
which many, if not all, were taken in Utah.
Five of the landscapes are from California.
Seven photographs are of Indians, most, if not
all, in New Mexico. The photographs are not
dated, but eight of the landscapes have printed

 

 

 

 

 
Hillers, John 4°
headings for the “Geological and Geographical
Survey of the Territories, Second Division, J.
W. Powell, Geologist in Charge." John Wesley
Powell became director of the Second Division in
1875, and the organization was renamed the
Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky
Mountain Region in 1877. Thus, these eight

 

pictures were printed and mounted during 1875-
1877. Two other series of landscapes contain
pictures of some scenes from the same locations,
Boulder Creek, Utah, for example. Many of the
landscapes and all but one of the Indian photo-
graphs are mounted on boards that have identical

 
Hillers, John 5

Or Similar decorative borders around the images,
a further indication that the pictures date
contemporaneously.

The photographs represent at least five sep-
arate series which are itemized below.

Quotation marks have been used around the
titles of photographs that have titles printed
upon them. Titles or descriptions supplied
from other sources do not have quotation marks.

This series has the official identification
of the Survey printed on the boards in the mar-

gins above each image. Each image is surround-
ed by an artistic .gold border. The images are
variously 9 1/4 x 7 1/4-7 1/2 in. mounted on
15 x 13 in. boards. The photographs were not
numbered or captioned, but someone has pencil-

Series with Gold Border Around Images
But No Printing

The gold borders around the images are iden-
tical to the gold borders around the images of
the pictures on which the name of the Survey
was printed. In this series there is no

printing. These pictures were also not num-
bered and not captioned, but someone has
written captions on the front of the boards
using purple ink. Someone else has further
identified some of the photos with pencilled

 
Hillers, John Kenna 9
notations on the backs of the boards. The list
below uses these handwritten captions... The
images are variously 9 - 9 1/2 x 7 - 7 1/2 in.
with one 7 x 9 1/2 in. The boards are 15 x 13
in.

Series with Black Border Around Images

The images in this series are mounted on
boards that have a black decorative border
around the images that is very similar in con-
ception but different in detail from the gold
borders around the images of the above two
series. The images are 9 1/4 x 71/4 in.
mounted on 15 x 13 in. boards.

The tone of the images in this series is

 
Hillers, John Kenna 11
distinctly darker than those in the other
series that are clearly sepia in color. In one
case, a direct comparison can be made, for
there are identical views of Winslow's Cascade
in both this series and in one of the others.
These photographs are clearly not sepia-toned.
They are better described as purple-brown,
especially in the case of Winslow's Cascade.
Purplish tones were one result obtainable from
gold toning. The historical practice of toning
glossy albumen paper was the almost exclusive
use of gold toners, so it is most unlikely that
these photographs were toned otherwise, as by

 

 
Hillers, John Kenna 12

 

platinum toning. These matters are discussed
in: James M, Reilly, The Albumen and Salted
Paper Book, The History and Practice of Photo-
graphic Printing, 1840-1895 (Rochester, N.Y.,
1980), especially pp. 43, 77-78, 81.

The pictures were not numbered or captioned.

 

 

 

Someone has pencilled captions on the backs of
the boards, and these captions are used in the
list below.

Small Series, 1873

These ten photographs were made on the
Powell Survey during 1873. Most, if not all,

of them were taken in Utah and in the Grand
Canyon. The images measure 4 1/4 x 7 1/4 in.
or 7 1/4 in. x 4 1/4 in. They are mounted
upon 9 x 14 in. boards.

The photographs do not have captions or

 
Hillers, John Kenna 14
other marks of identification. They have been
identified as the work of Hillers by comparison
with prints and negatives at the National
Archives. The annotated photocopies used to
identify these photographs are filed in an
Information Folder placed with the pictures.
The numbers used below to list the photographs
are based upon the numbers in use at the
National Archives.

Mr. Joe D. Thomas, Chief, Still Print
Branch, National Archives, reported that the
Geological Survey destroyed some negatives that

were considered near duplicates or were of

California Series

These five photographs, albumen prints, have
either printed titles or else titles handwrit-
ten on the backs of the boards. The photo-
grapher's name is not indicated. Copies of

these photographs have been examined at the
National Archives, and they have been identi-
fied with the 57-PS negatives attributed to
Hillers. Mr. Joe D. Thomas, Chief, Still
Pictures Branch, of the National Archives, has

 
Hillers, John Kenna 19

 

written, however, that Hillers "may not have been the
actual photographer."

These photographs have been identified with
Hillers’ trip to California and Yosemite in 1892.
See Don D. Fowler’s The Western Photographs of John K.
Hillers (Washington, 1989) where Nos. 35, 37, and 43

are reproduced.
The images are 134 x 10 in. mounted on 14 x 11 in.
boards. The boards are gilt-edged. These photographs

are identical in size and mounting to two photographs
by William Henry Jackson. See his Yellowstone

National Park Series.

 
Hillers, John Kenna 20

The numbers assigned to the photographs are taken
from the negatives to which they relate in the
National Archives. The photocopies of these
photographs that were examined and annotated at the
National Archives are filed in an Information Folder
filed with the pictures.

Domed Mask Series

This photograph was made with the use of a
mask that was placed over the negative in order
to give the photograph a particular shape. In
this case, a domed mask was used that gave a
curved top to an otherwise rectangular picture.
The use of such masks is noted and illustrated
in Paul N. Hasluck's The Book of Photography
(London, New York, etc., 1905), pp. 157-159.
The rectangular photograph measures 9 1/4 x

 
Hillers, John Kenna 27

7 1/2 in., and the domed image measures 7 1/2 x

6 in. The photograph is mounted on a 13 3/4 x

Henry Washington Hilliard (1808-1892) was
born in Fayetteville, N. C. After teaching
English literature at the University of Ala-
bama, he moved to Montgomery where he practiced
law and entered politics. He served as chargé

d'affaires to Belgium, U. S. congressman, and
minister to Brazil.

Hilliard opposed secession and in a letter of
Nov. 30, 1860, to Harper and Brothers was

 
Hilliard, Henry Washington
optimistic about Alabama's prospects of re-
maining in the Union.

Other correspondence in this collection is
miscellaneous in content and concerns auto-
graph collectors (Feb. 23, 1884) and William
Sprague and Jefferson Davis (Dec. 5, 1868).

When this collection was recataloged, three

 

items which had been transferred from the
Charles Colcock Jones, Jr. Papers to the
Hilliard Collection were returned to their for-
mer location. These items are letters from

Hilliard to Jones.

written by and to John B, Hinkson while he was
a student at LaFayette College in Easton, Pa.
and later when he entered law practice in Media
Pa. Many of the letters were written by Hink-
son's parents, who discuss such things as
family affairs, money matters, and news in the
community. During the period, 1856-1860, the
father wrote of the hard times and the financ-
ial difficulty that he was having. A letter an

The papers are of significance mainly for the
light they shed on student life at LaFayette
College and at the United States Naval Academy,
1859-1860. Of special interest are the letters

 

written by H. DeHaven Manley, a midshipman at
Annapolis. Both boys write about their courses,
examinations, grades, friends, campus elections,
and activities and "pranks" of the students in
their respective institutions. Hinkson wrote

about a near riot ~~ 2 in Nov. ,1859,

in which faculty and students came to blows. A
newspaper clipping is included which gives a
description of the event,

In writing from Annapolis, Manley frequently
mentions activities of the Maryland legislature
and comments on the excitement created in the
city by the presence of the legislators and

 

their wives. In one letter (Jan. 10,1860) he
gives a description of the legislators.

12, 1858, mentions the Lecompton Constitution
and praises Thomas Hart Benton. He goes on to
say that Presidents should have the qualities
of such men as Webster, Clay, and Benton. A
letter of July 17, 1858, mentions politics and
the fight between the Lecomptons and the anti-
Lecomptons,

Hinsdale Family. Papers. Raleigh, Wake
County, North Carolina

 

This collection centers around John Wetmore
Hinsdale (1843-1921), a successful lawyer and
businessman, but other major figures include:
his mother, Elizabeth Christophers (Wetmore)
Hinsdale (d. 1885); his father, Samuel Johnson

Hinsdale (1817-1894), a pharmacist and amateur
scientist of Fayetteville; his wife, Ellen
(Devereux) Hinsdale, daughter of the wealthy
planter, John Devereux, of Raleigh; and their
six children: Margaret Devereux (Hinsdale)

 
Hinsdale Family 2
Englehard (b. 18/72); Samuel Johnson Hinsdale
(b. 1875); Elizabeth Christophers (Hinsdale)
Winfree (b. 1877); John Wetmore Hinsdale, Jr.
(1879-1971); Ellen Devereux Hinsdale (b. 1881);
and Annie Devereux (Hinsdale) Joslin (b. 1883).
The Hinsdales, in tracing their ancestry, ac-
cumulated genealogy on the following families:

 

the Lanes, Pollocks, and Devereux of North
Carolina; the Livingstons and Bayards of New
York; and the Johnsons and Edwardses of Con-

necticut,
The collection is arranged as follows:

 
Hinsdale Family 2A
correspondence (1819-1971); political corre=-
spondence (1930-1935); financial papers (1864-
1961); legal papers (1712-1926); miscellany;
clippings (1856-1973); writings (1784-1950):
printed material (1915-1970); genealogy; pic-
tures; volumes; and an oversize folder.

The central figure of the collection, John

 

(continued ‘on next card)

 
Hinsdale Family 3
Wetmore Hinsdale, was born in Buffalo, N.Y.,
but reared in Fayetteville, N.C. He received
his education at a boarding school in Yonkers,
N.Y. (graduated in 1858) and the University of
North Carolina (1858-1861). Letters during
these periods and Vol. I of his diary. concern
school life, visits to relatives on Long Is-

 

land, and his existence as a university stu-
dent.

Hinsdale's education was interrupted by the
Civil War. At the age of 18 he joined the Con-
federate Army as aid-de-camp to his uncle,

 
Hinsdale Family * 4
General Theophilus Hunter Holmes. He served
as adjutant general under General James John-
ston Pettigrew, whom he admired greatly, and
under General William Dorsey Pender, whom he
disliked. He later rejoined his uncle’ s staff.
Serving first in Virginia, Hinsdale partici-
pated in the Battle of Seven Pines and the
Seven Days' Battle around Richmond. Trans-
ferred to the Trans-Mississippi Department with
his uncle, he distinguished himself at the
Battle of Helena. During the last year of the
war, he was colonel of the Third Regiment of

 

¥ See alse Theophilus Hunter é.... Tapers in this Dept.

 
Hinsdale Family

Junior Reserves, also known as the N.C. 72nd
Regiment. He kept a diary during the period
1860-1864 which records his daily activities.
Besides excellent descriptions of the battles
in which he participated, he recorded descrip-
tions of men like Holmes, Pender, and Petti-
grew, Generals P. G. T. Beauregard, A. P. Hill,
Benjamin Huger, Stonewall Jackson, J. E. John-
ston, Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, J. B.
Magruder, Sterling Price, G. W. Smith, and
others, For the most part, however, the diary
consists of entries concerning daily military

 

 
Hinsdale Family 6
activities, his various love affairs, and his
busy social life.

Other sources of information in the collec-
tion on the Civil War include the C.S.A. War
Department Records book, a partially indexed,
bound collection of orders, circulars, and let-
ters from the War Department and Bureau of Con-

 

scription to General Holmes during the period
1863-1865. This is particularly useful for
learning about conscription policy as it ap-
plied to North Carolina; courts-martial of
deserters; impressment of Negroes, both slave

 
Hinsdale Family re
and free, to work on Confederate fortifications
and the Invalid Corps. Letters between 1861
and 1865 contain information about civilian
life during the war, particularly in Fayette-
ville, N.C., and Little Rock, Ark., what women
did for the war effort, and the fears and dis-
couragement of the civilians. Information

 

about Reconstruction appears in the letters
during the period 1865-1870.

Immediately following the Civil War, Hins-
dale attended law school at Columbia College
in New York City. Several notebooks from Law

 
Hinsdale Family 8
school are contained in the Volumes section.
Admitted to the bars of both New York and Nort
Carolina in 1866, and later to the U.S. Supreme
Court, Hinsdale returned to Fayetteville to
practice his profession. He married Ellen
Devereux in 1869 and moved his growing family
and law practice to Raleigh in 1875.

 

Hinsdale became an expert on insurance, cor
poration, and railroad law. The collection
contains 25 letterpress books, most of which
are indexed, covering the years 1886-1892, wit
a few breaks in the run (Hinsdale numbered them

 
Hinsdale Family 9
consecutively, and this run contains volumes
69-101, with volumes 77, 79, 87, 88, 93, 95,
and 96 missing). The letterpress books, be-
sides containing entries of an ordinary legal
nature, contain information on N.C. government
and politics, taxation, roads, railroads, and
finances. Hinsdale was a lobbyist for rail-
road interests both within and without the
state, numbering among his clients Enoch Pratt
and John Mitchell Robinson, both prominent
businessmen of Baltimore, Md,

Being a prominent lawyer, Hinsdale

 

 
Hinsdale Family 10
corresponded frequently with others in his pro-
fession, some of whom included: William Jack-
son Adams, Theodore Galliard Barker, Hugh Len-
nox Bond, Henry Ravenscroft Bryan, Char les
Manly Busbee, Fabius Haywood Busbee, Ralph
Potts Buxton, Julian Shakespeare Carr, Walter
Clark, Thomas Charles Fuller, Williamson White-

 

head Fuller, John Alexander Gilmer, John Wash-
ington Graham, William Woods Holden, Thomas
Jordan Jarvis, Bradley Tyler Johnson, Samuel
Fox Mordecai, Levi Parsons Morton, James Cam-
eron MacRae, * James Speed Pirtle, Theodore

 
Hinsdale Family 11
Dehon Rand, William Blount Rodman, Jr., Charles
Addison Russell, Daniel Lindsay Russell, Furn-
ifold McLendell Simmons, John Humphrey Small,
Jo Lane Stern, Henry Waters Taft, Charles Ran-
dolph Thomas, R. Emory Warfield, and Legh Rich-
mond Watts.

Volumes 99-101 of the letterpress books deal
exclusively with the Carolina Brownstone Com-
pany, in which Hinsdale was a part-owner and
president. The company either did not last
very long or it changed hands because it does
not appear in the N.C. list of corporations

 

 
Hinsdale Family 12
for 1902-1904.

In the late 1890's, Mrs. Hinsdale became
active in various women's clubs. She was a
founder of the General Pettigrew Chapter of
the United Daughters of the Confederacy in
Raleigh, a member of the Daughters of the Amer-
ican Revolution (see genealogy), and a charter

 

member and officer of the. Ladies' Hospital Aid

’ Association of Rex Hospital in Raleigh. There
are two minute books for the latter organiza=
tion for the period 1896-1902 that record the
activities of the ladies in fund-raising drives,

 
Hinsdale Family 1
social events, and sewing bees.

During the 1890's the focus of the collec-
tion switches from Hinsdale to his childreng
Letters are almost exclusively of a persona
nature, The courtship letters of Elizabeth C.
Hinsdale and Dr. Jack Metauer Winfree in 1903-
1904 and of Annie D. Hinsdale and Harold Vin-

 

cent Joslin in 1908 form a large bulk for this
period. Dr. Winfree was a prominent physician
and instructor at the Medical College of Vir-
ginia in Richmond, and his letters give an
interesting view of a medical practice at the

 
Hinsdale Family 14 -
turn of the century. Letters from the period
of the First World War discuss the various

ways that the family aided the war work from
one grandson's attempts to join a flying squa-
dron, to Ellen D. Hinsdale's belated decision
to join the American Red Cross and go to
France, to letters from a friend describing

 

what it was like to work in a war industry.
John Wetmore Hinsdale, Jr., followed his

father's footsteps, attending the University

of North Carolina in 1896-1899, and then

joining the law profession. He does not appear

 
Hinsdale Family 15
often in the collection until 1928 when, as
president of the Capital Club of Raleigh, he
became involved with plans to construct a new
club and office building. He served two terms
as state senator from Wake County in the 1930's
The letters in Political Correspondence, Clip-
pings, and a Scrapbook contain information on

 

this phase of his life. His pet projects in-
cluded a reorganization of the tax structure
by the introduction of a luxury tax, the re-
organization of the N.C. State Board of Health
and the N.C. Board of Examiners, and a proposal

 
Hinsdale Family 16
for the state to take over the maintenance of
county roads, These sections of the papers
also contain information on Hinsdale's politi-
cal race, the gubernatorial race of 1932, and
conflicts with the R. J. Reynolds Company.
Among other items of interest not mentioned
above are: a clipping section containing

 

Civil War reminiscences, information on wed-
dings and deaths, and law cases in which John
Hinsdale, Sr., became involved; an 1847 map of
Raleigh showing locations of buildings and
ownership of land; family photographs; writings

oversize rh trlo &

 
Hinsdale Family 17
by various members of the family; legal papers,
wills, and financial papers; school notes on
different subjects; and autograph books from
John Hinsdale, Sr.'s, years at the University
of North Carolina.

One volume of interest is the "Liverpool
Memorandum-Book" which contains a diary, mem-
oranda, and accounts for 1755 (with a few
scattered entries for other years). The anon-
ymous author of this volume lived near Hert-
ford in Perquimans County, N.C. Entries re-
cord travel in Bertie, Chowan, Perquimans, and

 

 
Hinsdale Family 18
Pasquotank counties. The diarist frequently
went to "town," and several references indi-
cate that his residence was close to it (Apr.
ye May 10, and June 27, for example). The
"town'' was apparently Hertford, for he twice
mentioned it in proximity to crossing or fer-
rying the Perquimans River (June 26-27 and

 

Dec. 28). Normally his trips to town did not
involve crossing the river, so he probably
lived to the east of it. He farmed, surveyed,

and in August he began a dam and mill. Many
family names mentioned are and were common to

 
Hinsdale Family 19
Perquimans County. This volume may have be-
longed to a member of the Pollock family, since
Mrs. Ellen Hinsdale was a descendent through
the Devereux line and since they resided in
Perquimans during the 1750's.

2 items & 3 vols. added, 11-23-77. These
three volumes and the items found within them

 

were originally cataloged in 1933 and 1937.
Two volumes are from John Wetmore Hinsdale's
legal practice: Claim Record, 1889-1890 (Vol.

15883: and Collection Book, 1870-1876 (Vol.

 
' Hinsdale Family 20

 

The third volume is especially interesting.
Labeled "Cotton Chopper Ledger," it is the Led-
ger, 1873-1875, of the Diamond Cotton Chopper
and Cultivator Co., a Fayetteville, N.C., firm
that produced a machine invented by J. B. Under-
wood of that city. It was first used on the
crop of 1873. The firm's name is identified by
an invoice found attached to an account on page
118 (now filed in a folder with the volume).
Postcards about business of the company were

attached to pages 6 (now in folder) pnd 14, |
These postcards were addressed to John W.

 
Hinsdale Family 21
Hinsdale,who had offices in both Raleigh and
Fayetteville and who lived in the latter city
during part of the 1870's, Hinsdale must have
been a principal figure in the company, perhaps
one of the owners, if not the owner. Lists of
persons to whom agencies were offered are at the
end of the ledger, so it belonged to the manu-
facturer, not an agent.

An advertisement describing and illustrating
the machine can be seen in the Raleigh Christian

Advocate, April 1, 1874 (and other issues). The

 

 
Hinsdale Family 22
machine “at one operation chops, bars both sides,
weeds and dirts the cotton." After chopping it
converts into "the shape of Harrow Sweep for use
between the rows."' It took the Gold Medal at
the Georgia State Fair and other awards.

There are 162 pages of accounts for customers
and agents. Sales are itemized. An especially
valuable feature of these accounts is the nota-
tions that evaluate the character, reliability,
financial circumstances, and nature of the busi-

ness or occupation of the customers. These

 

 
Hinsdale Family 23
notations amount to a credit guide to persons
all over the South, whose names are in the index.
Other records also appear in the volume.

ore

This collection deals almost exclusively with
family affairs. When the letters begin, 1870,
they are received by Mebane Hinshaw, in Randolph
Coes N. C. He seems to be in charge of settling
the family estate. Most of the letters of the
first half of this period come from the south-=

eastern corner of Kansas, in which his cousins,
represented primarily ee L M. Hinshaw, negoti=
set

ate about the final ement of the Hinshaw
estate in North Carolina. S. M. Hinshaw's let-
ters also mention the brevity of land deeds and

 
Hinshaw, Mebane. . 2

 

prices of land in Kansas, the town of Oswego,
crop failures, and opportunities for women in
Kansas.

During the second half of this period, after
1882, almost all the letters come from Mebane
Hinshaw's son, J. W. Hinshaw, (Willard) who is
employed as salesman and expansion agent for a

tree and plant nursery co. owned by Col. A. M.
York, who he says is a former U. 8S. Senator from
Kansas, but he is not listed in the Biographical
Directory of Congress. His work takes him to
various places, from which his letters come, ex-

 

 

 
Hinshaw, Mebane. 3

 

tending throughout Missouri, Kansas, Colorado
and northern Texas. To his father he writes
very little about his business, but keeps a run-
ning comment on farming opportunities and meth-~
ods in this new country. In the summer of 1883,
he was writing from Prairie Centre, Kansas, and
he expresses a preference for that state over

N. C. since he sees more equality in society
there and school terms run for at least seven
months, with teachers being paid forty to fifty
dollars per month. In 1885, he speaks of the
demands by Kansas farmers for girls to do house-

 
Hinshaw, Mebane.

 

work at $2.50 to $3.00 per week and board. He
repeatedly offers his financial help, even his
share of the family estate, to other members of
his family who might be in greater need of it
than is he. In his last letter, dated Sept. 28,
1901, he arranges to send the money for the re-
lease of a mortgage against the property of his

sister in Randolph Co., N. C. who is suffering
from repeated illness. Incidently, this letter
also had the following heading:

Greenwood Nursery & Berry Farm

Eureka, Kansas. J. W. Hinshaw, Proprietor.

 
Hinshaw, Mebane 5

2 items added, 7-7-0060: Letters to Mebane
Hinshaw from members of his family. Ina
letter dated Nov. 16, 1851, an uncle who had
moved to Indiana discussed family matters and
his personal affairs in Indiana. On March 27,
1870, several cousins in Iowa wrote Hinshaw

concerning the settlement of Zebedee Hinshaw's
estate.

 

13 items added, 8-26-66: Letters from
Mebane Hinshaw to his wife during his service
in Co. B, 6th Regiment of N.C. Troops. Hinshaw
was a Quaker who was forced to take up arms so

 
Hinshaw, Mebane 6
that he and his family might escape persecution
and punishment.

In his letters to his wife, Hinshaw dis-
cussed the punishment inflicted by the C.S.A.
Army upon a Quaker who refused to fight (Jan.
29, 1865), the low morale of the southern
troops during the closing months of the war,
and the increasing number of deserters from the
Army (Jan. 22, 29, and Mar. 1, 1865).

The Topic was a weekly magazine published
by J.W. Hinshaw. A manuscript copy of Vol. III

 

 
Hinshaw, Mebane 4 7
No. 7 (June 6, 1877) includes poetry, anecdotes
and incidents occurring at New Garden, N.C.

1 item added, 6-3-68: A receipt for ex-
penses paid by J. W. Hinshaw at New Garden
Boarding School (March 5, 1880)

2 items added, 5-31-82: Letter to Mebane
Hinshaw by John R. Ray, State Organizer for
the Knights of Labor, announcing that he would
be in Hinshaw's neighborhood soon after June
24, 1886, and asked him to let him know if he
would be ready to organize an "Assembly" of
the Knights of Labor; and a letter written by

 

 
Hinshaw, Mebane

W. B. Hinshaw on Dec. 17, 1889, from Central
Falls, N.C., stating that he had some Indian
relics such as arrow points, a rock hatchet,
and beads.

Randolph County, North Carolina’

 

Thomas Hinshaw operated a mercantile business
in Kemp's Mills, N.C., and was connected with
the Staley Mills in Staley, N.C. He may have
been related to Mebane Hinshaw, also of
Randolph County, whose papers are likewise

housed in this department.

Although the Hinshaw papers are primarly
comprised of family correspondence, there are
several notable items in the collection. On
Aug. 5, 1863, Hinshaw wrote an account of his

 
Hinshaw, Thomas 2
experiences in the Confederate Army. Being a
Quaker, he did not want to serve in the Army.
He was drafted, however, and was punished by
his regiment, the 52nd Regiment of N-C. Troops,
for not bearing arms after his conscription,
Hinshaw also describes his capture, treatment,
and subsequent release by the Union forces,

 

Other material relating to the Society of
Friends are two printed letters from the
Yearly Meetings in London in 1848 and 1851 and
a letter from Jacob Hinshaw, Dec. 9, 1914, who
condemns the modern tendencies prevalent among

 
Hinshaw, Thomas
the Friends in Indiana,

Additional subjects discussed in the
correspondence are the Salvation Army in
Indiana (Apr. 11, 1900), cattle prices (Nov.

15, 1903), the elections of 1914 (Dec. 9, 1914),
and the school system in Checotah, Oklahoma
(Dec. 23, 1923).

 

The eight bound volumes are ledgers, pre-
sumably from Hinshaw's mercantile firm. Three
volumes have been numbered since it was pos-
sible to ascertain their logical order in the
accounting system. The remaining volumes are
quite (continued on ‘6 cara )

 
Hinshaw, Thomas 4
confusing, but it appears that Thomas Hinshaw's
firm was the result of a merger or the succes-
sor firm to a mercantile business owned by a
F.T. Hinshaw. The volumes date from 1875 to

1884 and 1899 dealing with purely personal mat-
ters, the most significant of which reveals that
Hinson was proposing a reunion of James
Islanders who had survived from antebellum days

 

(1895, Apr. 10). There are also eleven legal
documents, mainly deeds and wills, dating from
1770-1913, many of which relate to Hinson's
landholdings on James Island. The most

 
Hinson, William G. 3
interesting of these is a contract of Jan. 6,
1868, by which Hinson hired twenty-seven Negro

laborers to help him to work his land in return
for a portion of the crop.

1918. Winchester, Va. 3349 it. & 2 v. Sketch

 

The collection starts with early wills,
deeds, and legal papers of Christman (or
Chrisman), Fravel, and Branson families cen-
tering in Hardy Co., Va., from 1797. In-

cluded is a late 19th century copy of a copy

of excerpts from a 1709-1711 journal of Ann
Butler Brayne, wife of Alexander Spotswood,
governor of Va., and Kate (Brayne) Berger.
These sisters were nieces of the Duke of Or-
mand and wards of Queen Anne.

An 1836 letter ry John C. Chrisman

 
Hite, Cornelius Baldwin, Jr, 2
tells of travel in the South and the poor
health of southern people in the summer (ma-
larialfever).

There is an 1843 letter from Florinda
(Tayler) Jones, 18t wife of William Strother
Jones from "Vayclause," near Newtown (Stephens-

 

burg), Va.

There are some Gales legal documents and
letters (1824, 1827, 1844, and 1865) in the
collection. Joseph Gales, Jr., married Sarah
Juliana Maria Lee, who was the daughter of
Theodoric Lee and i io Hite. An 1853

 
Hite, Cornelius Baldwin, Jr. 3
letter from the Soliciter of the Treasury men-
tions judgments held by the U. S. against
Joseph Gales, Jr. An 1859 letter asks Col.
Hickey for more copy to complete the publish-
ing of the Gales and Seaton state papers. An
1860 account for services rendered to Gales

 

and Seaton is included. A series of 1866
letters from Sarah Juliana Maria (Lee) Gales
Claims compensation for destruction of her
property by the U. S.

The main geographical locale is Win-
chester, Frederick 6 Va. The collection

 
Hite, Cornelius Baldwin, Jr. “
centers about Cornelius Baldwin Hite, Jr,
(1842-19--) whose father, Cornelius Baldwin
Hite, Sr., was killed in a hunting accident
at "Belle Grove," Va., in 1842. Cornelius
Baldwin Hite, Jr.'s mother was Elizabeth Au-
gusta (Smith) “Hite. Both families are much

 

intermarried and belong to "good," old Va.
families. The papers are interesting princi-
pally as background material for gouthern
reconstruction. The reader acquires a clear
picture of the struggles and hardships of
the educated white ¢ whose families

 
Hite, Cornelius Baldwin, Jr. 5
had owned much land and many slaves. Some are
totally unable to overcome their difficulties
and make a living for themselves, preferring
to live at all costs in Va. in semi- destitu-
tion. Others go to Texas, and the Midwest

and far West. There are many letters which

 

give excellent descriptions of the surround-
ings of the emigrants. Hite used his mother's
money in making bad investments, and, even
though he tried many occupations, he was never
able to make a living. He married Margaret
Lewis Marshall, “on of Chief

 
Hite, Cornelius Baldwin, Jr, 6
Justice Marshall in 1871. She had no money,
and also had to help "bring up" her impoverish
ed brothers and sisters. The Hites had no
children; and they, and Hite's mother, spent
their lives moving around.

family matters and the financial difficulties
of most of the members of the family. Hite

an interesting account of Tom Thumb playing
billiards. Hite travels about Texas vainly
trying to make a living, but he writes ex-
cellent descriptive letters of Dallas and

 

Sherman. A Feb. 20, 1876 letter gives a good
description of meals and service in a Sherman,

Samuel Hodgdon was a prominent Pennsylvania
patriot. After serving in the Continental
Army, he returned to Philadelphia where he
became in 1785 a commission merchant in

partnership with Timothy Pickering. This
partnership was probably dissolved when
Pickering moved to western Pennsylvania in
1785. Hodgdon was active in civic affairs and

 
Hodgdon, Samuel. 2

 

was a member of the Agricultural Society of his
city. He was appointed Quartermaster of the
U. S. Army on March 4, 1791, and held this
position until April 19, 1792.

Hodgdon attained the rank of colonel in the
Pennsylvania militia and served under Clement
Biddle, quartermaster of the state. The

letters in this collection, written by Biddle
to Hodgdon, concern supplies for the troops
engaged in suppressing the Whiskey Rebellion
of 1794 in western Pennsylvania.

was presumably the addressee of an undated let-
ter from Henrietta Maria Bowdler, the religious
writer. The letter may have been written in
1821, because Miss Bowdler mentioned having just

purchased Joanna Baillie's Metrical Legends pub-

Joanna Baillie's literary work, Miss Bagot, and

David Hoffman (1784-1854) was a lawyer, legal
educator, and author. He is listed in Who Was
Who in America.

He was the author of Views on the Formation

of a British & American Land and Emigration
Company, Addressed to the British Public (Lon-

 

 

 

 

 

don, 1848). This enterprise was the W icet
of a letter of Sept. 29, 1850, from Robert
Walsh, U.S. consul general in Paris.

W. O. Hoffman studied at the Dickinson Com-
mercial College's Branch at Cumberland, Mary-
land. These three volumes are exercise books
from his studies in bookkeeping and accounting.

They include a journal, daybook, and cashbook.
These volumes date from about the 1870's

or perhaps somewhat later. The handwritten

examples in the exercises are dated 1850's and

1870's, mostly the latter. The paper has water

 
Hoffman, W. O. 2

 

marks of 1850. The covers of the volumes were
printed by the Cumberland Daily News Co. Ac-
cording to the American Newspaper Annual (1891),
the Cumberland Daily News was established in
1871. The city directory of Cumberland in 1917
lists a William O. Hoffman, a concrete contrac-

 

 

tor. These facts indicate that the volumes
date from the postbellum rather than the ante-
bellum period despite the use of paper from

1850.

These few letters reveal that Whit and Moses

family were aspiring farmers who had, during
the war, managed to purchase their land and
several slaves, and that Mary C.Hoge was very
anxious for her sons' safety. Her letter

 

mentions the making of a quantity of clothing
for the two sons. Thomas P. Hoge's letter
chiefly refers to his efforts to have his

Hogs and Campbell. Daybook, 1772-1773.
Wilmington, New Hanover County, North Carolina.

 

This daybook from a mercantile firm in
Wilm: ington, N.C., contains entries from Oct.
19, 1772, to April 10, 1773. The volume lacks
any identification of its ownership. However,
it belongs with an account book in the Robert
Hogg Collection at the Southern Historical
Collection of the University of North Carolina.
The numbers written on the left of the entries
in our daybook cite the page numbers where
they were posted into a second daybook, 1771-
1775, listed as Vol. IV

ry the Robert Hogg

 
Hoge and Campbell 2
Collection. The posting of entries from one
daybook into another, instead of directly into
a ledger, suggests that the daybook at U.N.C.
was a controlling journal for the business as
a whole. Our daybook apparently represents one
part of the firm's operations.

The identity of the firm depends upon the

 

Hogg Collection at U.N.C. In that collection
the entries in Vol. III, Journal, 1767-1772,
can be traced into Vol. II, Ledger, 1767-1772,
so that these two books belonged to the same
company. Vol. IV, Journal, 1771-1775, belonged
to a separate firm. 6 fact is evidenced by

 
Horr and Campbell 4
entries in the two journals at U.".C., Vols.

III and IV, that represent business transactions
between the two companies to which the journals
belonged, Many entries are complicated by
transactions involving more than two parties,
such as when goods were handled by consignment.
However, simple transactions between the two

 

companies can be traced. For example, the
Journal, Vol. III, records a payment of #100

on March 31, 1772, to Hogg and Campbell (p. 359)
This transaction is recorded in the other
Jounnal, Vol. IV, on March 31 as a receipt of
#100 from Robert Hoge @ 74). The purchase

 
Hogg and Campbell ip _4
of shingles on April 14, 1772, Vol. IV,
demonstrates the same relationship. Therefore,
Volumes II and III belonged to the firm of
Robert Hogg, and Volume IV belonged to Hogg
and Campbell. Robert Hogg could have owned
both companies, but there were two separate
business operations. Our daybook accompanies

 

Vol. IV and was owned by Hogg and Campbell.
The daybook contains the names of numerous
prominent men among whom are William Hooper,
John Burgwin, Roger Moore, Thomas Henderson,
and Samuel Swann. Hooper's transactions are

 
Hogg and Campbell be

 

extensive.

Hogg and Campbell were among Wilmington's
most important merchants according to Hugh T.
Lefler and Albert R. Newsome, North Carolina
(Chapel Hill, 1954), p. 102. They also operated
stores in Bladen Co., Cross Creek, and Hillsboro

Another Hogg and Campbell vol. is listed in
the manuscript collections of the Archives of
