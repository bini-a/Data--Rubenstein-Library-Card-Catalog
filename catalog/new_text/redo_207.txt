Noel Edward Noel-Buxton, First Baron Noel-
Buxton (1869-1948), was the second son of Sir
Thomas Fowell Buxton, Third Baronet. He was
educated at Harrow and Cambridge. From 1889
until 1904 he was associated with the family

brewery. In 1900 he unsuccessfully contested
the parliamentary seat from Ipswich as a
Liberal candidate. He later served in the
House of Commons as member for Whitby, 1905-
1906, and North Norfolk, 1910-1918. He then

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 2
Noel-Buxton,.

 

joined the Labour Party and held the seat from
North Norfolk from 1922 to 1930. For two

short terms in 1924 and 1929 to 1930, he was
minister for agriculture and fisheries. He was
created Baron Noel-Buxton in 1930 and joined
the Labour peers in the House of Lords.

The collection spans most of his life and
represents many of his social and political
interests. However, the number of manuscripts
on any one subject is usually not large.
Family correspondence is extensive from the

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, “irst Baron 3
Noel-Buxton.

1880's, and numerous relatives are represented.
Many of these letters are undated. A biography
of Buxton is Mosa Anderson, Noel Buxton A Life
(London, 1952). His interest in foreign affairs
is discussed in T. P. Conwell-Evans, Foreign
Policy from a Back Bench 1904-1918 (London, 1932)

 

 

 

In 1895 Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton became
governor of South Australia, and Noel and his
sister, Victoria, went there for a visit. On
October 4, 1896, Noel wrote from Townsville,
Queensland, and reported on his travels there

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron
Noel-Buxton,

 

and.in the vicinity of Mareeba and Cairns.

On July 6, 1900, Charles Frederick Gurney
Masterman, Liberal politician and author,
wrote a long letter in which he discussed
Buxton's dealings with Hearns and Co. about a
studentship, the Christian Social Union, the
Commonwealth, the Ipswich election, temperance,
an outline for a social manifesto, Christianity
and Liberalism, and personal aims. Masterman's
strenuous career in Parliament and his ill

health were noted on Jan. 27, 1906, by Daniel

 

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, "irst Baron 5
Noel-Buxton,

 

Conner Lathbury, a journalist. In Dec., 1935,
Lucy Masterman, Charles's wife, noted her
political activity in the Dorset elections and
her work. on a biography of her husband.
Buxton's unsuccessful candidacy for the
parliamentary seat at Ipswich in 1900 is

represented among the newspaper clippings by

a section from the Sept. 29 issue of The
Elector for Ipswich and Woodbridge. It contains
Tetters to the electors from Buxton and two

other candidates-Sir Daniel Ford Goddard and

 

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 6
Noel-Buxton.

 

Felix T. Cobbold. A letter from Lord Rosebery
to Sir Hedworth Lambton, a Liberal candidate

at Newcastle, was also printed. On Oct. 4
Edward North Buxton, Noel's uncle, wrote about
the defeat at Ipswich and his interest in
getting Noel into Parliament later.

In 1904 Buxton resigned from the family
brewery in order to devote himself to politics.
A typed statement, undated and unsigned, is
an explanation of the writer's resignation
from the directorship of an unnamed establish-

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron
Noel-Buxton.

 

ment in order to take up politics. The
statement may relate to Buxton's resignation
from the brewery.

On March 5, 1905, Aneurin Williams, a
barrister of the Inner Temple, gave his opinion
of an article by Buxton's brother on Christ-
ianity and historical criticism. He also
stated what he believed had evolved to replace
traditional religion--the service of other
living things, expecially one's race,

In June, 1905, Buxton upset Ernest William

Beckett, a longtime Conservative M.P., ata
bye election in Whitby. He used a newspaper
cutting service, and there is an extensive
file of clippings about the Whitby election
from a variety of sources. Both free trade
and temperance figure prominently in the
clippings that date from June to Sept., 1905.
The folder of notes apparently has some speech
notes from this election.

On June 3, 1905, Edward Clifford congratulat-
ed his friend for his victory but complained

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 9
Noel-Buxton

 

about Liberals abusing their political opponent
a tactic less common among the Unionists.

On August 24, 1905,.Joseph Allen Baker, a
Liberal politician from London, noted the
attacks made on Buxton by the temperance people
despite his support of local control and his

agreement with Lord Peel's report. He
welcomed Buxton's entry into Parliament
because Of his Christian concern, a point that
appeared in other letters about his electoral

wins and defeats.

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 10

On Oct. 12, 1905, Bertram Robert Hawker,
Buxton's brother-in-law, wrote from South
Australia about the progress of educational
reform there, and he commented on the positions
of Premier Price and Treasurer Peake of the
Labour ministry. Hawker continued his dis-

cussion on Jan. 1, 1906, and also stated his
opinion of Frank Tate, a noted educationist
from Victoria.

In Jan., 1906, the Liberals had a great
victory in the parliamentary elections. How-

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 1l
Noel-Buxton

 

ever, some of the bye election results of
1905 were reversed by the voters, and Buxton
lost his contest at Whitby that was normally
a Conservative stronghold. Some possible
reasons for the defeat appeared in the letters
of sympathy received by Buxton at that time.
On Jan. 27 Daniel Lathbury noted the oddity
of author Hilaire Belloc's election from a
workers! district in Lancashire. On the 30th
Wilfred Lawson (later the Third Baronet)
commented on the national election and the

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 12
Noel-Buxton

 

Liberal victory in Cumberland where his father
was victorious.

On June 9, 1906, Sir Eldon Gorst,an assistant
under secretary of state for foreign affairs,
wrote to the Balkan Committee in behalf of
Sir Edward Grey, the foreign secretary. Gorst
explained the government's position on the
question of the proposed increase in the
Turkish customs duties. The European powers
consented to an increase of duties ina
protocol of April 25, 1907, and Grey was

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 13
Noel-Buxton

 

critized for it.

Edward Clifford, an evangelist residing in
London, was a friend of Buxton. After
Clifford's death Buxton wrote a character
sketch of him. The manuscript and a printed
copy of this sketch entitled "In Memoriam:
Edward Clifford" are filed with the folder for
articles and printed material. The manuscript
is dated Sept., 1907. Clifford was associated
with the Church Army.

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 14
Noel-Buxton

 

On April 22, 1908, Buxton discussed his
position on the Licensing Bill and the
temperance problem.

In July and August, 1908, Buxton negotiated
with Joseph Albert Pease for a parliamentary
constituency to contest. Pease became the

chief Liberal whip in 1908. Six letters

from Pease concerned the seats of Mid-Norfolk,

South Hunts, Huntingdon, and North Norfolk.
Twelve manuscripts are copies of official

Austrian and British diplomatic correspondence

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron L5
Noel-Buxton

 

of Dec., 1908, and Jan,, 1909. The printed
sources of some of the documents are

indicated. In 1908 Buxton and other represent-
atives of the Balkan Committee visited Turkey.
The Austrians objected to the activities of
British travelers, such as Buxton, in the

Balkans, and the diplomatic correspondence
about them included comment on Buxton.

On Oct. 27, 1958, George Edwards, general
secretary of the Agricultural Labourers' and
Small Holders' Union, reported to Buxton on

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 16
Noel-Buxton

 

the electoral situation in North and Mid-
Norfolk. He wanted Buxton, a tower of strenrth
to the union in Norfolk, to contest North
Norfolk. Buxton's notations on the letter
recorded some verbal remarks by Edwards. On
Feb. 11, 1909, Edwards tried to persuade Buxton
toaccept an office in the union. He noted the
possibility of Sir W. B. Gurdon's retirement
from Parliament and expressed the union's
interest in Buxton as a candidate in North

Norfolk.

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron iL?
Noel-Buxton

 

On June 9, 1909, George W. E. Russell, a
London politician, supported Buxton's work
about the Turkish atrocities against the
Armenians.

A few days later on the 16th, C. A. Millman,
agent for the South-East Cornwall Liberal
Association, asked Buxton to be a candidate
from that strong Liberal district. On the 22nd,
Joseph Pease informed Buxton of a possible
vacancy in Derbyshire because of Sir Alfred
Jacoby's serious illness. In that case the

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 18
Noel-Buxton

 

miners would probably run a Progressive Labour
candidate acceptable to the Liberals. However,
if they chose a Socialist objectionable to the
Liberals, the latter might put up a candidate
who would have a good chance to win.

On June 3, 1910, Sir Gerard Lowther, British

ambassador to Turkey, thanked Buxton for a
contribution to the Boys School Fund and made

a few general comments about the situation in
Turkey. On March 17, 1911, he counseled
patience toward the Young Turks and noted their

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 19
Noel-Buxton

 

sensitivity to any criticism. He avowed the
fairness of the Balkan Committee. He doubted
that the government would help with the school,
In mid-1911 the Maltsors of Turkish Albania
revolted. On August 28 Leland Buxton wrote
from Scutari, Albania, about the aftermath of
the revolt. Later on Sept. 3, and Oct. 22
Mary Edith Durham, author, also reported on
conditions in the district. She later wrote
Struggle for Scutari (London, 1914).
Anglo-German relations were the subject of

 

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 20
Noel-~Buxton

 

an article by Buxton, "England and Germany,"
that was published in the Nov., 1911, issue of
the Contemporary Review. A reprint of this
article is filed with the printed material.

On May 16, 1912, Travers Buxton, secretary
of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Rrotection
Society, wrote to Buxton about several matters
that he wanted brought forward during the
colonial debate-the House Rule Ordinance in
Southern Nigeria, the situation in the New
Hebrides, and race relations in South Africa.

On Oct. 22, 1912, W. Cecil Harris commented
on dissension within a committee headed by
Buxton, presumably the Balkan Committee of
which Harris was a member.

A small group of manuscripts concern the
First Balkan War, 1912-1913. A three-page

printed document of Oct. 12, 1912, in entitled
the "Manifesto of the Balkan Committee." It
was issued upon the outbreak of the war. A
broadside of Nov. 25 is entitled "Balkan War
Relief Fund, An Appeal." It includes a message

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 22
Noel-Buxton

 

from Buxton at Lozengrad. In the fall of 1912,
he and his brother, Harold, visited the Balkans.
A typed article (6 pp.) entitled "Balkan War
Relief Fund" has pencilled notations that it

was written for the Daily News. The date of

the article is Dec. 17. It is filed in the

 

folder for articles and printed material. A
statement of Buxton's account with the relief
fund is dated Dec. 24. On the 25th Lady
Victoria Buxton, Noel's mother, entertained
several prominent Bulgarians, including D.

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 23
Noel-Buxton

 

Daneff, one of the delegates to the London
Conference. Her letter, probably dated in
late Dec., recorded some of the Bulgarians'
comments on the war and the conference, On
Jan. 22, 1913, William Arthur Moore, corre-
spondent for the Times, wrote to Buxton from
the Bulgarian Army Headquarters at Dimotika,
a town south of Adrianople, Turkey. His letter
(9 pp.) is dated in 1912, but the events
described place the letter in 1913 when the
Bulgarian Army was encamped near Adrianople.

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 24
Noel-Buxton

 

Moore was on his way to Sofia and had recently
visited Drama in Macedonia. He discussed in
detail some of the war relief work in Macedonia
and some of the persons who were directing

it. There are five pages of notes on the
stationary of the Balkan War Relief Fund.

They concern the status of the fund and the
efforts being made to acquire donations.

Several manuscripts concern World War I and
its aftermath. On May 5, 1915, Baron

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 25
Noel-Buxton

 

Fitzmaurice wrote about his ill health, his
recommendation of Gooch for an under secretary+
ship in the Foreign Office (apparently George
Peabody Gooch), his skepticism about the
Gallipoli expedition, the lack of interest in
foreign affairs in the House of Commons, the

suggestion that a European congress in 1913
might have avoided the war, and the rumor

that Grey had been against such a conzress.

On Dec. 2, 1916, Sir Maurice de Bunsen,
diplomat, discussed terms suitable for a peace

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 26
Noel-Buxton

settlement with Germany short of a complete
Allied victory. On Feb. 8, 1917, Buxton
reflected on the relationship between reform

and law breaking and commented on the current
diplomatic situation. On May 23, 1917, Jessie
Brodie of the National Union of Women's Suffrage

 

Societies summarized her views on pacifism and
Christianity.

On July 28, 1918, Buxton commented on the
war aims debate in Parliament, the coming
election, and his position relative to the

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron a 4
Noel-Buxton

 

Liberal and Labour parties.

On Oct. 18, 1919, Hilda E. (Deichman)
Bismarck-Osten, Buxton's cousin, wrote from
Pomerania about the distressing economic and
political situation in Germany. She and her
Husband, Karl Bernhard, are listed in Wer Ist's.

In the summer of 1919 Rumanian troops
deposed the Communist regime of Bela Kun in
Hungary. They occupied Budapest on August 4.
At that time Buxton visited Budapest at the
request of the British Food Mission in Vienna.

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 28

A carbon copy of a report (7 pp.) by Buxton

is entitled "Events at Budapest, Aug. 5-7."

He discussed conditions in the city, criticized
the Rumanians, and suggested sanctions against
them. The report is filed with the articles
and printed material.

There is a statement (5 pp.), dated Dec.
31, 1928, of the expenditures made during
the year by the Noel Buxton Trust. Buxton
established this fund in 1919, and its income
was used for a wide range of educational,

The Reverend Anthony Charles Deane became
canon of St. George's, Windsor, in 1929 and
chaplain to the King in 1934. In 1935 he
published a volume entitled The Valley and
Beyond, a work on immortality. A typed,

 

 

unsigned article (19 pp.) is a review of this
book. It is filed in a folder for articles
and printed material.

In the printed material thereis a pamphlet
by A. Pelham Burn entitled World Order or

World Chaos that was published in 1936 under
the auspices of the Peace Maintenance Society.
In 1939 Lord Noel-Buxton (created Baron
Noel-Buxton in 1930) wrote a short statement

about the purpose of the war with Germany
and the need to avoid a peace settlement like

 

that of Versailles. His statement appeared
in the winter, 1939, issue of Service in Life
and Work, p. 49. Other articles by notables
also concern war aims. A copy of this issue
of the periodical is filed with the printed

material.

On March 11, 1940, Noel-Buxton wrote to The
Times about the need for a readable, portable
edition of the Bible. On March 14, Anthony
Charles Deane, chaplain to the King, explained

Bo

his ideas for an edition suitable for use by

troops in the field. He referred to his recent
article, "Religion and National Life," that

was published in The Times on Feb. 17, 1940.
Deane discussed the - neglect of religious
education in Britain. A copy of his article

is filed with the printed material.

On Oct. 6, 1944, Noel-Buxton commented that
both he and Gooch (apparently G. P. Gooch)
had moved to the right in their political
attitudes.

In 1932 Noel-Buxton and others visited

Ethiopia on behalf of the Anti-Slavery Society.
The Emperor assisted their investigation and
promised to end slavery within twenty years.

An unsigned copy of a letter of Feb. 24, 1945,
was probably written by Noel-Buxton to an

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron . 33
Noel-Buxton
Ethiopian diplomat. The writer renewed the
Society's interest in the abolition of slavery
in Ethiopia.

In a letter dated only June 27, E. Irlam
Briggs, artist, explained her painting
entitled "Macedonia" that Noel-Buxton had in

 

his possession.

In an undated letter Charles Roden Buxton,
Noel's brother, discussed several constituencies
that he was thinking about contesting.

Lady Betty Balfour wrote from Inverary Castle

 
Noel-Buxton, Noel Edward, First Baron 34

where she was on a visit. She gave her impres-
sions of another guest, Gertrude Margaret
Lowthian Bell, traveller and archeologist, and
recorded some of her views, including her
adverse opinion of the Balkan Committee. Lady
Balfour's sister-in-law, Lady Frances (Campbell)

 

Balfour, was a sister of the Duke whose family
seat was Inverary Castle. The letter is
Signed only "B.B.," but she mentioned inviting

miscellaneous group, 1906-1941, include clip-
pings on a variety of topics, such as politics,
temperance, the Balkans, woman suffrage, the
naval debate of 1914, World War I, Bulgaria,
Macedonia, and slavery in Ethiopia.

scenes in the Balkans. Most of the pictures
are undated. An empty envelope found with
the pictures was labeled "Horrors and War 1912,"
so some of them must date from the Balkan War
of 1912. A few pictures were dated as early

 

as 1905 and 1906, and others may also antedate
the conflict in 1912.

There are over one hundred miscellaneous
notes, some of which were made for specches,
About half of the notes are dated from 1903 to

are represented.

356 items added, 6-14-65. These manuscripts,

Wilson Norfleet died, an inventory and evaluation

James Lawson Norris was a patent attorney in
Washington who was very active in Democratic
politics. He was treasurer of the Democratic
Congressional Committee, 1888-1904, delegate
to the Democratic National Convention, 1892,
1900, and 1904, and member of the Democratic
National Committee, 1892-1896, 1900, and 1904.

The three letters from his friend Senator
Zebulon Baird Vance of North Carolina are about
the death of his father and political matters.
In his letter of condolence of Feb. Ty 1887,

 
Norris, James Lawson 2

 

Vance praises Norris's father highly and says
that he will attend his funeral if his physi-
cian feels that he has sufficiently recovered
from a surgical operation to do so. Letters
from Senator Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of
Kentucky to Norris and his son are of a per-

sonal nature. The other correspondent, Sen-
ator John Tyler Morgan of Alabama who had been
a Confederate general, writes about Democratic
party factionalism, especially between southern
and northern Democrats, his support of Senator

 
Norris, James Lawson 3

 

Arthur P, Gorman in the latter's efforts to
wrest party control from Grover Cleveland, and
personal affairs. Two of Morgan's letters were
written in July, 1903, from Warm Sulphur
Springs in Bath County, Virginia, and in the
second letter he describes the accommodations

there and at Hot Springs in the same county.
In July, 1905, he wrote from Bailey Springs in
Lauderdale County, Alabama. He mentions the
medicinal quality of the water there, his in-
vention for the perfect combustion of smoke

he felt that the country might "get through the

Captain Robert Norris was the master of
commercial sailing vessels that traded on the
Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the U.S. and at
some foreign ports in the West Indies, Panama,
and Mexico. His home port was Hyannis,

Massachusetts. His voyages are recorded in
accounts that he kept during 1845-1854 and 1859-
1860. With the exception of one sloop, his
vessels were all schooners. These ships

 
Norris, Robert 2

 

apparently carried a variety of freight.

The accounts for these voyages are recorded
in Norris's Account Book H, 1845-1854 (64 pp.)
and in three loose sheets, 1859-1860 (5 pp.).
There are three basic categories of accounts
for each voyage: disbursements, port charges,
and stock (or freight). Norris made detailed
entries for both disbursements and port charges,
and so there is a detailed itemization of
expenses. The stock account is usually summary
figures only. It records the proceeds from

 
Norris, Robert 3
freight shipments and the ports of origin and
destination. Unfortunately, the nature of the
freight is identified only occasionally. Some-
times the type of freight can be gleaned from
the port charges. Goods transported included
fish, cotton, lumber, molasses, tobacco, etc,
In one instance, June 8, 1854, Norris provided
a summary calculation of the expenses and pro-
ceeds of a voyage.

The ships, dates of the voyages, and ports
of call are listed below. Often one voyage

 

 
Norris, Robert
would include multiple calls at one or more
ports:

North Carolina. State Papers. . ‘|

Thirty-one manuscripts, 1785-1789, concern
the ratification of the Constitution of the
United States by the State of North Carolina.
In general these items reflect the contents of
the James Iredell MSS. in these years.

The papers* begin on May 19, 1788, with a
letter by John Lamb of New York, chairman of an
association called "Federal Republicans." He
urged a coalition of the states which had not
yet ratified the Constitution, together with the
need for amendments before the adoption of the
new plan. The letter is addressed to Willie

(Stex =

 

 
North Carolina. State Papers
Jones, Leader of the Opnosition to ratification
in North Carolina.

The state did not accept the new Constitution
in its convention at Hillsborough in Aug., 1788.
A campaign was then waged by the Federalists to
educate the state, so that the General Assembly
which met at Fayetteville on Nov. 17, 1788, re-

 

ceived many petitions urging the call of a new
convention to reconsider the Federal Constitution.
Twenty-six oversized items in this addition
(stored in the Picture Cabinet) are original
petitions from the counties of Camden, Carteret,

 
North Carolina. State Papers a

states. Many petitions condemn the "irregular"
course of the first (Hillsborough) convention in
regard to amendments to the Constitution. In
some cases the vetitions evidently had a blank
space left for the insertion of a county name.
The counties for the most part presented their
petitions to their representatives to the Genera

 

Assembly.

In Carteret County this movement seems to have
been led by Colonel John Easton and Caleb Bell.
The names signed form a roster of its citizens
in Nov. of 1788. An addition of names attached

 
North Carolina. State Papers. DoS Pee
Chatham, Dobbs, Duplin, Edgecombe, Hertford,
Hyde, Johnston, Lincoln, Martin, Mecklenburg,
Onslow, Randolph, Richmond, Rowan, Sampson,
Surry, and Tyrrell. These petitions state reasons
for ratification, the chief of which appear to
be weariness of anarchy and miserable misgovern-
ment, the fact that eleven states had accepted
the new plan, and the desire to participate in
the benefits derived from union. Camden County's
petition is concerned with the national debt and
public and private credit, while Randolph County
refers to the interest on the foreign debt of the

 

 
North Carolina. State Papers 5

 

to the petition comes from "Ocacock" and Ports-
mouth.

Chatham County sent its petition to the
Speaker of the House, John Sitgreaves.

Dobbs County petitioned with signatures of
members of the grand jury.

Edgecombe circulated four petitions.

Randolph County in the western part of the
state (presumably through the efforts of William
R. Davie) presented a very large petition drawn
up by militia companies.

This was also the method used in Rowan County

 
North Carolina. State Pavers 6

 

On the petition of Surry County are many
Moravian names. Of these, one, Gottlieb Shober,
was an extensive land owner (See Ephraim Kirby
MSS.in this department).

The petitions are valuable rosters of North
Caroline citizens in Oct. and Nov., 1788. There
seems to have been a large number of such

petitions, as some in this group are labeled No.
59 and No. 65.

A document dated Nov. 17, 1788, is a copy of
resolutions passed by the Senate of the General
Assembly, whereby a new convention is called to

 
North Carolina. State Papers. 7
reconsider “the new constitution heid out by the
Federal Convention as a Government for the United
States." Signed on Nov. 17 by the Speaker of
the Senate, Alexander Martin, it was also signed
by John Sitgreaves, Speaker of the House of
Commons, on Nov. 21, 1788.

Alexander Martin, as Governor of North

 

Carolina in 1789, received on May 5 a letter
from George Clinton (1739-1812), Governor of New
York. Clinton was the determined leader of
opposition to the Constitution in that state. He
sent the resolution of the New York Senate and

 
North Carolina. State Papers 8
Assembly on amendments to the Constitution of the
United States. The enclosure presumably was los
A document containing twelve amendments to
the Constitution is undated. The United States
Congress finally proposed twelve amendments to
the Constitution on Sept. 25, 1789. The undated
listing of twelve amendments in this addition
seems to be a copy sent to or made for North
Carolina for ratification. The first two amend-
ments in the MS. are those never ratified by the
states. The last ten amendments proposed became
the Bill of Rights of the Constitution (Amend-

 

 
North Carolina. State Papers. 9
ments I through X) ratified by the states on Dec
15, 1791.

The final item of this addition, a petition
to the Congress of the United States, is dated
Aug. 31, 1789. North Carolina was more than two
months away from ratification of the Constitutim
by its Nov., 1789, convention. Its elected del-
egates had not yet assembled. The coastal trade
of the state suddenly found itself treated as
foreign tonnage in ports of the United States.
Hugh Williamson, a leading Federalist and North
Carolina member of the Constitutional Convention

 

 
North Carolina. State Papers 10
of 1787, drew up a petition to redress this sit-
uation, which was a peril to local bankers, mer-
chants, and shipowners. This petition gives a
brief but vivid picture of the condition of
coastal trade at the beginning of the federal
period.

This collection contains the correspondence primarily
of C. A. Fink as President of the North Carolina State
Federation of Labor (AFL), but also includes some letters
of James F, Barrett, Public Relations Director of the
Asheville Central Labor Union. The correspondence and

newspaper clippings concern the issue of the invitation
by the U.S. Army to Dr. Ralph Brimley, Superintendent of
Forsyth County Schools, to share in a leadership mission
to Japan in 1951. The invitation was withdrawn allegedly

 
North Carolina State Federation of Labor.

 

after Fink and William Green, President of the American
Federation of Labor, protested the appointment because
of anti-union remarks Brimley had made in a speech. A
controversy ensued, particularly in the press and on the
part of North Carolina Congressmen.

Included also are the Proceedings of the North Caro-
lina State Federation of Labor for 1950 and 1951.

Since this collection has not been cataloged in
detail, only general subject entries have been made for
it.

Admiral Charles Stuart Norton (1836-1911),
U.S.N. is the recipient of nine letters from
his colleague, Admiral Charles Dewey. At the
time of the writing of these letters, 1878-1880
Dewey was naval secretary of the Light-House

Board of the U. S. Treasury Department and
Norton a lighthouse inspector stationed prin-
cipally in Charleston, S. C.

Dewey's letters refer mainly to routine
matters concerning the maintenance and con-

The collectio contains a letter dated June
14, 1870, from Norton to an unnamed General.
He asked the General to send him a printed copy
of a "Military Bill" currently pending in Con-
gress and his opinion as to whether or not he

thought it would become law. He said he was
especially concerned about the bill for its
provisions might affect his status in the ser-
vice. He said that although he thought he

 
Norton, Frank Henry
himself had been treated badly by the authori-
ties in Washington, he still preserved some
interest in the Army.

Norton said he was planning to write a book
about his reminiscences on Reconstruction,
particularly as it related to the military

 

administration in Mississippi after the war.
He indicated the work would endeavor to show
how the "sagacity of a few of our military
commanders baffled the defeated insurgents in
their ... efforts to revive ... the political

cause of the war." He was writing about that.
period of time when military rule was instituted
in Mississippi in the late 1860s after Missis-
Ssippi refused to adopt the thirteenth and
fourteenth amendments to the Constitution and
its enactment of Black Codes.

He said in order to write the work he would
need access to primary source material (e.g.
official records and correspondence). In
particular he asked about the whereabouts of the

 
Norton, Frank Henry

 

Army's 4th Military Division records, indicating
he either needed access to or have at his dis-
posal their records. Apparently Norton never
published such a work (a check of the National
Union Catalog Pre-1956 Imprints does not indi-

cate one) but there are several published works
to his credit.

 

The letterhead carried the business name
Star Foundry, Culbertson & Fisher, located in
Wheeling, West Virginia.

pet) ourse (1843- ? ) was a Civil War

volunteer from Chicago who enlisted in the
Union Army in July, 1862, and served through
the war until his discharge in July, 1865.
Following the war he seems to have been an

 

accountant in Chicago. gy,j.F.

The papers of J Nourse consist of a
diary (282 pp.) @xclusively devoted to his
experiences as a soldier from the date of his
enlistment on July 22, 1862, to his discharge

 
Nourse, James 2

on July 3, 1865, with one additional entry

at the end dated March 8, 1867, and a list of
dead (probably from his unit) which contains
some dates as late as 1878 at the beginning

of the volume. Nourse's unit is usually cited
as the “Chicago Board of Trade Battery"
(artillery), but its final or regular designa-

 

tion is "James H. Stokes' Independent Battery,"
although it is sometimes referred to as the
"Tllinois Battery" under either Captain James
H. Stokes or Captain George I. Robinson.

 
Nourse, James

 

For most of the period Nourse served, this
artillery unit was part of the Army of the
Cumberland - under the successive commands
of Generals Rosecrans, Grant, Sherman, and
Thomas - and is usually cited as part of its
Cavalry Corps. Nourse describes his part in

the Battle of Stone River or Murfreesboro
(Dec. 31, 1862 - Jan. 2, 1863), the Battle of
Chickamauga (Sept. 19-20, 1863), over a dozen

minor skirmishes in Sherman's eastward advance
from Tennessee to Atlanta, the fighting

 
Nourse, James 4

 

around Atlanta which followed its evacuation
by the Confederate Army (May - Oct., 1864),
the Battle of Nashville (Dec. 15-16, 1864),
and General James H. Wilson's Cavalry Raid
through Alabama and Georgia (March 22 -
April 20, 1865). He was not always in the

thick of the fighting. As a reporter he
seems to be of fair quality. The best battle
descriptions are those of Stones River and of
the fighting around Atlanta. Since he seldom

 
Nourse, James 5

 

failed to make an entry on any given day, the
diary gives an excellent sense of the flow of
events of a soldier's life in a rather
objective, dispassionate tone. He describes
day to day life in camp very well - stressing

the food, the weather, the frequency of drills,
recreational activities, his various degrees
of comfort and discomfort, the amount of

sleep he gets, how often he gets to go to
church, rumors, and news that he hears.

 
Nourse, James 6

 

Detailed portraits of other people, ranging
from privates to generals, are rare. He
seldom provides close description of the
landscape and does not stress information on
the technical aspects of his role in the
artillery unit. Nourse renders the route of

march in meticulous detail, showing a marked
awareness of place-names. His account
suggests that his attitude throughout the
experience remained that of a good patriotic

 
Nourse, James 7

 

Union soldier who wants to fight and kill the
rebels, although he never talks about reasons
or motives - personal or national - for the
war. He seldom expresses his own opinions on
politics or the execution of the war. Still,
for a man aged nineteen to twenty-one, he is

fairly perceptive in his observations of the
subjects he chooses to discuss,
An important consideration in dealing with

the diary is that we have no reliable know-
ledge of exactly who made this copy of it,

 
Nourse, James 8

 

except that it was acquired from persons who
got it from a member of the Nourse family.
Nourse mentions writing in a little notebook,
or a series of little notebooks, since he
states on the last day of 1863 that ‘he has
finished one such notebook. On December 18,

1864, he relates how he lost his "diary book"
during a rainy spell and later found it in
the mud. The book we have is obviously a
copy made by someone. We have no idea who
made the copy - perhaps it was even Nourse

 
Nourse, James 9

himself - nor do we know anything about its
degree of faithfulness to the hypothetical
original,

Memorable incidents from the diary include
the time a shell fell a few feet from Nourse
but failed to explode during a skirmish on
the way to Atlanta (May 27, 1864); the burning

 

of the public buildings and tearing up of the
railroad track and the skirmishing with the
rebels in Jonesboro, Georgia (Aug. 17, 1864);

 
Nourse, James 10

 

the taking of Selma, Alabama, with the capture
of 2300 prisoners (April 2, 1865) and the
plundering which followed (April 3-4, 1865);
and the bringing of recently-captured C.S.A.
President Jefferson Davis with his family

into Nourse's camp near Macon, Georgia

(May 13, 1865). But the best thing about the
diary is not its relation of any specific
incidents, but rather the picture it provides
of what it was like, day to day, from a

 
Nourse, James 11
personal point of view, to be an enlisted
man in the Union Army during the Civil War.
The author of this diary was Private
Benjamin F. Nourse. The diarist opens with
the words: “This day bro” John, friend Willie

 

and myself enlisted in the ‘Chicago Board of
Trade Battery.’” The Report of the Adjutant
General of the State of Illinois lists two

members of the Nourse family as privates in

 

 

 
Nourse, James nF
this unit: John A. Nourse and Benjamin F.
Nourse. Copies of the pertinent pages from
the Report are filed with the diary. B. F.
Nourse was one of the compilers of the
Battery’s sketch in the Report, and his diary
was one of those used in its composition.

Craven County, North Carolina

 

Romulus Armistead Nunn (1876-1966) was a law-
yer and prominent citizen in the community of
New Bern, North Carolina, whose career spanned
most of the first six decades of the twentieth

century. He was very active in politics, mainly
at the local level, and during the long period
of his practice before the bar he had several
important clients. Probably the most signifi-

cant was his close friend Senator Furnifold M.

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead Z
Simmons, an older man whom Nunn seems to have
always admired deeply. The best sketch of
Nunn's life is found in The National Cyclopaedia
of American Biography, Vol. 51, p. 559. The
collection consists of thirty-nine boxes of
Papers and seventeen volumes, The vast majority
of the collection portrays in great detail the

 

 

 

various facets of Nunn's career as a lawyer.
There is relatively little material touching on
purely political or intimate, personal matters,

although some of the few items about politics

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 3

 

are quite enlightening - especially those pass-
ing between Senator Simmons and Nunn, who acted
as the Senator's faithful lieutenant back home
among his constituents,

Nunn was born June 22, 1876, in Jones County,
North Carolina. From 1885 to 1891, he attended
public schools in New Bern. During 1894-95 he
was a student at Davidson College, after which
he enrolled at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill where he was a member of the

class of 1899, He studied law in private office

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead

 

including that of Senator Simmons. and A, D,
Ward, and was admitted to the bar in February,
1898, He then seems to have opened his law
office in New Bern, perhaps practicing in part-
nership with Simmons for awhile,

Among Nunn's most important clients in his
early career was Walter Francis Burns, a rich,

globetrotting businessman who hired young Nunn
to handle many of the details of erecting a
statue of his ancestor Captain Otway Burns in

the cemetery at Beaufort, Captain Burns was

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead é 5
commander of the privateer Snap Dragon in the
War of 1812, during which he “sailed the seas
from Newfoundland to South America, captured
many British merchant vessels, and made a for-
tune for himself." There is much in the collec-
tion about Otway Burns and his memorial statue.
Throughout his early career, Nunn also took care
of other, more routine matters for W. F. Burns
such as collecting rent on his landholdings
around New Bern. Their letters provide a de-

tailed picture of their business relationship.

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 6
Senator Simmons also gave Nunn much business in
the early years. Before 1906 most of their
correspondence concerns only routine errands
which the Senator wanted Nunn to take care of,
such as collecting rent from tenants, handling
offers to buy or sell land, disposing of details
of legal cases. Another major concern in his
early legal practice was his work as receiver
of the Carolina Paper Pulp Company, a local firm
which went bankrupt in 1910,

Shortly after he had achieved a start in his

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 7

 

chosen profession, Nunn married Elizabeth Guion
Nicholls of Thibodaux, Louisiana, on April 28,
1903. His bride was the daughter of General
Francis Tillou Nicholls, who was twice Governor
of Louisiana and a longtime Chief Justice of the
Louisiana Supreme Court. Rom's wife "Pink"
(this was her nickname) subsequently presented
him with two daughters - Elizabeth and Eleanor.
There is very little correspondence touching
Nunn's family in the collection. Occasional

letters from his sisters and brothers do show

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 8
up, including some interesting ones in the 1920's
and 1930's from or concerning his sister Etta,
who was a missionary in San Luis Potosi, Mexico.

In his early career, Nunn was also extremely
active politically, especially in promoting the
interests of Senator Simmons. He worked hard
for the Senator's re-election in 1906 and again
in 1912. The first significant letters illus-
trating Nunn's relationship to Simmons occur in
1906. In April of that year, Simmons wrote Nunn
to get to work for him and on April 21, Nunn

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 9
reported back to the Senator, "I caused resolu-
tions endorsing you to be passed in the pri- |
maries of the several city wards last night.'
Later in 1906, on September 28, historian ane
educator R. D. W. Connor wrote ” asking Nunn to
endorse him for the position of head of North
Carolina public schools, also requesting Rom to

 

"feel the pulse" of Simmons on the subject. The
character of Nunn's relationship to Simmons is
again illustrated in a letter of April 7, 1910,
in which the Senator requests Nunn to secure

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 10
publication of an article in North C Carolina
newspapers which will assure that "the people"
are informed about his success in obtaining a
$1.76 million appropriation for the state in a
river and harbor bill. Nunn was apparently one
of Simmons's most trusted lieutenants and also
must have been well known in state political cir
cles as a friend of the Senator.

In 1908, Simmons's choice for Governor was
Locke Craig, and Nunn headed Craig's campaign in
Craven County. The letters of 1907 and 1908

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 11
provide a good picture of Craig's unsuccessful
run in Craven County, with many exchanges be-
tween the candidate or his state manager at the
top level and Nunn at the county level. One

of Nunn's appeals requested the voters of Craven
County to reward Craig, as they had rewarded
Simmons and others, for redeeming North Carolina

 

from "radical" and "negro" rule (verso of letter
of June 20, 1908). .

In 1910, Nunn himself was elected to the
state legislature as representative from Craven

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 12
County, and his letters of this time form a full
account of the campaign from his point of view.
He seems to have run primarily on the basis of
his character and career, rather than on any
issue, winning the nomination by a margin of
about 750 out of about 1700 votes cast. Nunn
served only one term and apparently chose not

to run for re-election. There is much corres-
pondence in 1911 about his activities in the
legislature, such as letters from constituents

on certain issues and Nunn's replies to these

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 13
letters, But there is little hint as to his

own personal views and little to indicate what
he thought of the experience of being a repre-
sentative.

In the Democratic year of 1912, Nunn went to
the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore
supporting Senator Oscar W. Underwood for Presi-
dent. Letters of 1912 touch on the Underwood
candidacy and the Post- ~convention Wilson cam-
paign as well as Simmons's resounding victory

over William W. Kitchin and Walter Clark, in

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 14

 

a race which the Senator saw as an especially
strong attempt by his arch political opponents
to defeat him, After 1912, Nunn seems to have
been largely uninvolved in state and national
politics until 1918.

It was toward the community level that Nunn
channelled most of his energy. Since he was a

lawyer, community service undoubtedly helped his
business, and throughout his career, Nunn ap-
pears to have been involved in a great diversity

of community activities. Always interested in

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 15
education, he was from 1905 a very active mem-
ber of the Craven County Board of Education. By
1911 he was City Attorney, a position which he
held for many years. He was a member of the New
Bern Chamber of Commerce, belonging to its Board
of Directors for a time, and in 1909 he began

a long stint as Chairman of the Board of Trust-

 

ees of the Firemen's Relief Fund of New Bern.
For a time he was president of the Craven County
Good Roads Association and also was a member of

the U. S. League of Local Building and Loan

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 16
Associations. Nunn was one of the first stock-
holders in the New Bern Building and Loan Asso-
ciation and acted as its attorney. In 1916, he
was appointed to.a one-year term as president of
the Atlantic and North Carolina Railway Company,
whose ninety-six mile railroad ran from Golds-
boro through New Bern to Beaufort. In the mid-

 

1910's, he also became involved in creating the
New Bern Drainage District and led in organiz-
ing a local chapter of the National Farm Loan
Association. The collection contains correspond
ence concerning all these activities, covering

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 17
some of them in great detail. One of the hall-
marks of the Progressive Era was a trend toward
formal organization and bureaucratization both

inside and outside government to solve problems
created by industrialism, national markets, and
other forces of the twentieth century. Nunn's

diverse organizational activities were in tune

with the times,

The coming of World War I had a marked effect
on Nuhn's activities. In late 1917, for example,
he went to Washington on behalf of local fisher-
men to talk to the Food Administration about its

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 18

 

regulations pertaining to fish off the North

Carolina coast. In addition, the governor ap-
pointed Nunn to the county board for advising

draft registrants about their rights and duties
under the Selective Service Act, He was later
made Government Appeal Agent on Selective Ser-
vice matters. On other fronts, Nunn made speec

es in drives for Liberty Loans and for member-
ship contributions to the American Red Cross.
As for politics, in 1918, he again worked hard
for the re-election of Simmons, but his largest
effort seems to have gone into managing Samuel

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 19
M. Brinson's race against Charles L. Abernethy
for the Democratic nomination to Congress. In
this first race Brinson prevailed when Abernethy
withdrew, and Brinson defeated the Republican
candidate in November, But in 1920, the two of
them went at it again, and Nunn was again Brin-
son's manager in a very heated campaign against

 

Abernethy. This time Brinson defeated Abernethy
by a 2-to-l margin. The collection gives a
fairly clear picture of Nunn in the war years
and -as’ campaign manager for Brinson.

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead

In the early 1920"s the focus shifts to Nunn's
role as City Attorney. Letters indicate that
he had heavy responsibilities pertaining to the
issuance of large amounts of City of New Bern
bonds for schools, water, streets, and overall
“public improvement." In 1923, the death of
James Augustus Bryan and the settlement of his
estate brought Nunn the legal business and
friendship of Colonel Charles S. Bryan, son of
James A, Bryan and perhaps the longest and best
served client of Nunn's career. Nunn continued

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 21

 

to work for Bryan and to correspond voluminously
with him until the 1950's. The great bulk of
the Nunn-Bryan letters concern legal questions
such as the settlement of the James A. Bryan
estate, suits or threats against tenants who did
not pay their rent, land transfers between Bryan
and private citizens or sales of Bryan's land to

the federal government. Only rarely would the
two men discuss topics other than business. In
1924, Bryan, who was living in New York City,
suggested to Nunn that the South should consider

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 22
voting Republican since the Democratic Party
seemed on the verge of collapse nationally. Nunn
respectfully disagreed, pointing out the power
the Southern Democrats held in Congress and main
taining that the national party would make a
comeback (Letters: October-November, 1924).
There is a bit of irony in this prediction of
Nunn's, for as he forecast, the Democrats did
make a comeback - beginning in 1932; but Nunn
was not to reap much reward from it, since

Senator Simmons was defeated in 1930 for turning

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead

 

against the national party in 1928,

Govenor Angus W. McLean a Nunn Supe-
rior Court Judge in January, 1926, to fill an un
expired term. In Juneof the same year, he easil
won election to the bench in his own right. He
seems to have found much satisfaction in his
service as judge, despite the long hours, the

travel, and the meager salary. Correspondence
during his judgeship (1926-30) is abundant -
most of it concerning his campaigns of 1926 and

1930, specific cases he heard, requests

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead

 

for pardons and reduced sentences, and the prob-
lems surrounding prohibition. Some of the pro-
hibition cases he found extremely frustrating,

and at one point he became involved in a contro-
versy over prohibition with his friend the ven-
erable Josephus Daniels, editor of the Raleigh

News and Observer (Letters: May, 1929). Nunn was

Narrowly defeated for renomination in 1930. The
reasons for his defeat, Nunn felt, were to be
found in the combination of well-financed oppo-

sition plus his widely-known association with

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 25
Simmons, who was beaten by a landslide that year
due to his famous move of bolting the Democratic
Party in 1928. In January, 1931, at the age of
fifty-four, Nunn re-opened his law office in New
Bern.

But bad times lay ahead. It was the beginning
of the Great Depression and Nunn had trouble

 

finding business and even more trouble collecting
fees for his services. He lost a considerable
sum due to bank failures, and he was soon vir-
tually broke, unable to pay his taxes. He con-
tinued to work for Bryan, and their letters of

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 26

 

the 1930°s complain of personal economic woes.
Colonel Bryan often comments on the Depression,
the New Deal, the world situation. He agreed
with President Roosevelt on the necessity for
vigorous national action against the dire eco-
nomic situation, but he often expressed fear
about the expansion of federal power and the

huge sums of money spent by the federal govern-
ment. Nunn, for his part, seldom wrote about
national politics except when specifically asked
by Bryan, and even then he seldom revealed much

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 27

 

about the character of his opinions. Perhaps he
had lost his taste for politics above the local
level - given the loss of his seat on the bench,
Simmons's defeat, and his financial troubles.
Much of his business now came from people who
were forced to declare bankruptcy, or corpora-
tions forced into receivership status, such as

the National Bank of New Berne, the Neuse Lumber
Company, and his friend ex-Senator Simmons. In
addition, he became involved in the federally-
financed relief programs at the local level in
New Bern, serving as Chairman of the Central

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 28

 

Planning Committee for the city and county
whose job was to propose worthwhile projects
for FERA, PWA, WPA, and CCC. There are some
notable letters to Chairman Nunn, one being
from spokesmen from the Negro community in New
Bern requesting the addition of a black person
to the committee (April 2, 1935). In his per-

sonal affairs, his legal business, and his
community service, Nunn thus felt in a most
direct manner the impact of the Depression and
the expansion of federal power under the New

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead

 

Deal emergency effort.

By 1938 his law practice appears to have
picked up somewhat, and he managed the Craven
County campaign for the re-election of Senator
Robert R. Reynolds. His prime client continued
to be Colonel Bryan. From 1939 the volume of
letters drops off considerably with the Bryan
correspondence dominant, In 1942, he became
County Attorney, continuing in this office
until 1959. In the 1950's, he was apparently
still practicing law, and recognized as an

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 30
expert on North Carolina history, especially
concerning the judicial system and the early
national period. He died on June 14, 1966.
Boxes 1 through 18 of the Nunn collection
contain letters (1885-1959), from which most

of the material in the foregoing account was
drawn.

 

Boxes 19 through 25 consist of "Legal Papers:
1791-1949," The majority of these papers are
deeds and records of land transfers, some of
them concerning the interests of F. M. Simmons

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead a.
and Charles S. Bryan. Other documents included
are briefs for suits on behalf of Nunn's
clients or the City of New Bern. The precise
character of the legal papers at any given
time generally follows the direction of Nunn's
major concerns at that time, In the early
1920's, for example, most of them involve the
issuance of the City of New Bern bonds.

Boxes 26 through 34 contain material about
those cases of his legal career to which Nunn
seems to have devoted the bulk of his time.

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 32

 

In this section are twenty-two categories,
each of which deals with an individual case.
The folders under each category contain all
documents directly relating to the case -
letters, legal papers, clippings, other items.
Each category is arranged in chronological
order. Nine of the categories concern legal

actions other than bankruptcies, Among these
are the suit for establishing the New Bern
Drainage District, Ann M. Donnell's Estate
Papers, and W. B. Venters vs. G. H. Simmons

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 33
(the Senator's son). The other thirteen cate-
gories involve bankruptcies such as Craven
County vs. The National Bank of New Berne, the
F., M. Simmons bankruptcy, and the receivership
papers on the Carolina Paper Pulp Company. Some
of the categories contain quite a lot of infor-
mation about the persons, estates, or busi-
nesses involved.

Box 35 consists of "Financial Papers" and
"Clippings." The financial papers are bills,
receipts, and financial statements - many of

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 34

 

them addressed to Nunn as City Attorney and
thus relating to the city government of New
Bern, They range in date from 1900 to 1942.
The clippings cover a variety of topics impor-
tant to Nunn from 1900 to 1958. The decade
1900-09 includes newspaper accounts of Locke
Craig's gubernatorial race and other happenings
in North Carolina politics. The decade 1910-19
has clippings on the state legislature of 1911
(of which Nunn was a member), some of Nunn's
statements to the press as City Attorney, and

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 35

 

press accounts of Josephus Daniels’s handling
of the Navy. Highlights of the clippings of ©
1920-29 include accounts of the Brinson-
Abernethy campaign of 1920, information about
the City of New Bern bond issues, and news-
paper comments on Nunn's service as a judge.
The clippings of 1930-58 are less numerous but
provide the same kind of information.

Box 36, "Writings and Addresses," has
several discussions of historical and political
topics. For example, the typescript of

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 36

 

Stephen F. Miller’s "Recollections of Newbern

Fifty Years Ago," written in 1873, is a fine
piece of local history which provides an
account of the town and its prominent citizens
in the early 1820's. An address which Nunn
seems to have delivered before the New Bern
Daughters of the Confederacy in May, 1918,
reveals some aspects of popular feeling about
World Warl,, portraying that conflict as a war
for democracy with the German Kaiser's imper-
ialism as its cause, There are a couple of

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead Ped
speeches on the Abernethy-Brinson contests, A
lengthy speech by Nunn traces the biography of
Richard Dobbs Spaight the Elder, Governor of
North Carolina (1792-95) and later a member of
Congress. There are several copies of a fifty-
page manuscript by Nunn entitled "The Federal
Courts in North Carolina," which presents a

 

brief history of the court system in the state
from colonial times to 1927, with stress on the
federal courts and their judges, concerning
whom Nunn provides many biographical facts.

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 38

Part of Box 3/ contains printed material,
including a splendid political leaflet from
1869 attacking Radical Republican Governor
William W. Holden and also a vague, mysterious
invitation to a charter meeting of some organi-
zation in 1921 whose principles sound much like
those of the Ku Klux Klan,

 

Part of Box 37 and all of Boxes 38 and 39
consist of "Miscellany" and include, among
other things, material on Craven County public
schools and the New Bern Drainage District,

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 5?
ists of voters, geneg@logical data, and some
minor information on New Bern history. There
are folders on New Bern's Firemen's Relief Fund
and, in addition, on a proposed city manager
plan for the town which Nunn opposed. A small
notebook dating from 1890-95 gives the minutes
of meetings of a local service club for young

 

ladies called the King's Daughters, for which
Nunn's sister Etta was secretary. This part of
the collection also includes Nunn's "President's
Report" to the stockholders of the Atlantic and

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 40

 

North Carolina Railway Company (1917) amd "Real
Estate Records of Charles S. Bryan" (1933-41).
Of the seventeen volumes, eight are busi-
ness records of the Carolina Paper Pulp Com-
pany, for which Nunn became receiver in 1910.
Three other volumes are similar records from
1912-14 of the Mutual Aid Banking Company,
which also went bankrupt. There is a volume of
financial records of the "State Firemen's
Relief Fund for the City of New Bern, N. C."
(1908-19), The most unusual volume is entitled

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 41

 

“Slave Reports: Muhlenburg County.” It comes
from Kentucky and is dated 1839-60. In 1839
the Kentucky General Assembly seems to have
passed an act requiring that slaveowners regis-
ter their slaves with their home county and
provide descriptions of them. The volume con-
tains some of the original handwritten pages
from these records, pages which were saved when
the information was transferred elsewhere.

Nunn apparently acquired this volume somehow
and found it interesting. There are, in

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 42

 

addition, two volumes which seem to be a ledger
and a cashbook for the general store of Moses
D. Lane. In the North Carolina Year Book of
1914, Lane is listed as a merchant in Fort
Barnwell, and papers in the legal case file
"Moses D. Lane Mortgage" show that he was a
substantial landowner in Craven County.

Persons whose accounts are in these volumes are
listed among the farmers at Fort Barnwell in
Branson's North Carolina Business Directory for

1897. These two volumes may contain records of

 

 

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 43

 

transactions between Lane the landlord and his
tenants.

Rounding out the collection is an excellent
set of pictures. These include a Nunn family
portrait and a portrait of Senator Simmons;
several group pictures of members of the Senate
or House of Representatives of the North

Carolina General Assembly for different years;
about thirty photographs of New Bern - its
streets and vicinity; and several large pic-
tures relating to the Atlantic and North

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 44

Carolina Railroad, such as photographs of loco-
motives.

The photographs of New Bern include 28 street
scenes of which many were dated during Nov. 1911
to Feb. 1912. The purpose of these pictures
seems to have been to illustrate the poor con-

 

dition of streets in various parts of the town.
Although the focus was upon street conditions,
the photographs are good for views of houses and
buildings and also occasionally for the activi-
ties of people, including blacks. A list of thesg¢

photographs is filed & them.

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 45
These photographs were all made by the
Wootten Studio of New Bern. The owner of this
studio was Mrs. Bayard M. Wootten, a prominent
woman photographer in North Carolina who lo-
cated at New Bern and later also at Chapel Hill
Her work included a collection of western scenes

 

and folk scenes from the mountains of North
Carolina. By 1914-1915 she was in partnership
with George C. Moulton as the Wootten-Moulton
Studio. ,

The identity of the actual photographer of

these scenes is not entirely clear. Eighteen

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 46

 

are signed by Bayard Wootten, and ten are un-
Signed. Her signatures on Nos. 3 & 20 are
different from her other signatures. All of
her signed photographs were also signed by
George C. Moulton as taken on a certain date.
He did not write "taken by." He did not sign

or date any views not also having Bayard Woot-
ten's signature on them. Moulton was working
at the studio. Presumably either he or Mrs.
Wootten made the photographs, although the
studio may have included. other photographers.

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 47
In appearance and coloration these photo-
graphs resemble albumen prints. However, the
street scenes, the portrait of R. A. Nunn and
his family, and a photograph of a pine forest
(also a Wootten-Moulton work) exhibit "silver-
ing" on the edges of the images or elsewhere,

 

a characteristic, along with fading, of the
deterioration of emulsion-paper prints. At
this period there were many photographic pro-
cesses, but the extent of the. silvering suggests
that these photographs are emulsion-paper

prints.

 
Nunn, Romulus Armistead 48
There is a large collection of Bayard
Wootten's negatives and also some of her pho-
tographic equipment and papers in the North
Carolina Collection, Wilson Library, Univer-
sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Broadsides from North Carolina in the Broad-

 

side Collection include items with Nunn's name
on them, and some of them appear to relate to
his clients or other matters.

Haller Nutt was the son of Dr. Rush Nutt
and Eliza Ker, daughter of Judge David Ker. Dr,
Nutt moved from Va. to Miss., where he purchas-
ed a plantation near Rodney, experimented with
plant foods, and bred a new strain of cotton.
Haller attended lectures at the Univ. of Va. and
graduated in medicine in Lousiville. After

 

returning home he engaged in agriculture, work-
ing with his father to improve Whitney's

cotton gin, and became one of the most ex-
tensive planters of that(Go to Card 2)

area, He owned large estates in La. and con-
ducted his planting operations on scientific
principles. Consequently the amount of yield
per acre and the quality of his cotton were far
above that of his neighbors, As a young man he
served asa J, P. in Tensas Parish and came to
be practically the political boss of that par-
ish,

In 1840 he married Julia Aygusta Williams,
and in 1853 purchased the property near Natchez
called "Longwood" Here he soon began the erec-
tion of a large house, octagonal in shape and

Showing a decided Moslem influence, which was
designed by Samuel Sloan of Philadelphia. It
was dubbed "Nutt's Folly," and the Civil War
came on before it was quite finished. Most of
the furnishings that had been ordered either

did not get through the blockade or were con-
fiscated, The house remains today an unfinished

structure. Haller was Unionist in sympathy

and suffered tremendous losses, He died in 1864

The papers in this collection are almost ex-
Clusively promissory notes, bills for goods,
receipts, drafts drawn by Nutt on certain com-
panies, and account sheets for cotton sold.

The bills afford a- lengthy list of articles

 

purchased by a wealthy planter and his family.
There are tax statements for 1852 and 1854 which
reveal the valuation of part of his property

and the amount of land and slaves held in Ten-
sas parish. Receipts and letters from Jno, R.

 
Nutt, Haller, Sketch. 5
Thompson show that Nutt subscribed to the Rich-
mond Enquirer, Natchez Courier, and The Southern

Literar Messenger,
There are reports for Mary and Carrie Nutt

while they were attending a girls! school in
Philadelphia in 1860. These reports give not
only the scholastic standing of those girls,

 

 

 

but they also list the subjects taught and the
expenses,

The latter part of the collection contains
several items relating to the construction and
furnishing of “Longwood," One of them is a

letter from Samuel Sloan, and there are lists,
some of them undated, of materials and furnish-
ings ordered for the house,

Appleton Oaksmith was one of four sons of
Seba Smith, editor and writer, and Elizabeth
Qakes (Prince) Smith, writer and lecturer. fhe
first mention of him in these papers bears the
date 1851. In that year he won over a thousand

dollars in a suit against the steamer, Gold
Hunter. He acquired part interest in the he brig,
Mary Adeline, and became its master. On Sept.

25 he arrived in Nicaragua from San Francisco
with freight and pass sengers , and from there he

 
Oaxsmith, Appleton. Sketch. e.
was to sail to outer ports, possibly to Europe
or back to Cal. During June of the next year
a letter was written to him by men on board H.
M. brigantine Dolphin in the River Congo, ex-
pressing high admiration for the "daring and
intrepid conduct displayed by you on the late
occasion of your vessel getting on shore on
Sharks Point in the River Congo on the 19th of
June when assisted only by your two mates you
gallantly defended your vessel from the murder
ous attack of at least 3000 natives, who had
assembled for the purpose of plundering her
Valuable cargo." @

 

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch. i)

By 1855, Oaksmith had become a merchant in
jew York, owner of the Mary Adeline, and agent
for several other ships. He Tater acquired sev
eral other vessels, two of which were seized
on a filibustering expedition, and one of whic
was lost at sea.

 

 

On Sept. 24, 1855, Oaksmith married an
Italian, Isotta Rebecchini, in Portland.

When Walker became president of Nicaragua
in July, 1856, he "had to choose a new minis-
ter to the United States to take the place

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch, 4

Teft vacant by the return of Fatner Vijil. His
choice for the place was Appleton Oaksmith, an
American who had been in the country only a- 4
bout three weeks. He had come down on the same
steamer on which Father Vijil had made his re-
turn trip, and went back on the steamer that

followed, having been in Granada itself a lit-

 

tle less than a fortnight. There was a reason
why he should have been honoured so signally
by Walker on such a short acauaintance. He had
coSperated with Gofcouria in securing aid late
in 1855 and early in 1856, and among other
things had been the moving spirit in promoting

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch, 5
the big Walker meeting in New York City on

May 25, which has already been desertbed. He
was reputed to have wealth and influence, and
it was thought that he could assist in raising
& loan for the new government, this being be-
fore the arrangements made by Walker and Soulé.
Oaksmith was a native of Portland, Maine, had

 

visited Nicaragua in 1850, before the Transit
was opened, and had travelled extensively in
Central and South America and in Africa and *
the Orient. On Aug. 15 ,-18565 Oaksmith notified
Marey of his arrival in Washington and present
ed his credentials eo. Walker. Mar-

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch. 6
cy notified him, four weeks later, that owing
to the condition of political affairs in Nic-
aragua the President could not receive him,
Oaksmith on Sept. 18 asked for explicit reason
why he was rejected, and was told that if the
President deemed it proper to give explana-
tions they would be made only to the govern-
ment which had asked to have him received, As
no explanation could be made to a government
which the administration had refused to recog-
nize, the matter was closed..."_-william 0.

Scroggs, Filibusters and Financiers, 1916.

 

 

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch. m
Perhaps another factor responsible for
Oaksmith's being appointed Nicaraguan minister
to the U. S. was that he had promoted the gi-

gantic mass meeting in N.Y. which had cele-
brated the recognition in Washington of Padre
Vijil as minister to the U.S. Oaksmith was
empowered to act for his govt. not only in the
diplomatic capacity of minister to Washington,
but also as general financial and commer¢ial
agent for Nicaragua.

 

Oak emith not only had difficulty trying to
get his credentials Y a in Washington,

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch, 8
but John P, Heiss, who was charge d'affaires

for Rw¥as at the Nicaraguan legation in N.Y. -
refused to resign.

 

 

In Nov, 1856, Oaksmith wrote Walker that
he felt the work he had done in securing sup-
pliés, the promise of a bank to negotiate a

loan, services of a leading financial journal
to advocate the loan, and the organization of
an emigrant recruiting system would have in-
sured his reception as the diphomatic repre-
sentative of Walker's govt. rather than the
man who had been sent to succeed; and asked

 
Oaksmitn, Appleton. Sketch. g
Walker to send him $10,000, which was not more
than half of what he had spent on his expedi-
tion. Years later, Oaksmith stated that he was
not accepted as a minister of Nicaragua be-
cause he was not a native of that country.

 

At a large meeting held in N.Y. on Dec. 20
for the purpose of raising recruits, money,

and supplies for Walker, Oaksmith was one of
the speakers.

On Dec. 1, 1856, a contract was made be-
tween Oaksmith and Gen, J.A. Paez, who was

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch, 190
desirous to take a "foreign legion" back to
Venezuela, By the agreement, Oaksmith was to
furhish transportation for not more than a
thousand men and arms and ammunition to the
amount of a million dollars.

 

In 1859, Oaksmith and Wm.H. Davis contrac-

ted to complete the Springfield, Mount Vernon,
and Pittsburg R.R.Co. and during that same
year Oaksmith secured a deed to the Virginia
and Eagle paper mills in Wheeling, Va. It is
not clear whether or not he became the actual
owner of those mills. The next year they were

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch. ih
advertised for sale.

 

At this time he referred to himself as a
shipping and commission merchant in N.Y., but,
always a many-sided man, his activities were
not confined to those categories. He projected
a railroad in Ohio to be built according to

specifications in the agreement between the
Ohio Grand Trunk R.R.Co. and the New York Cen-
tral and Hudson River R.R. Gompanies, and be-
came treasurer of the Union,League of N.Y., an
organization working to try to prevent the
formation of a 6 confederacy and civil

 
Oaksmitnh, Appleton. Sketch, 12
war. He was appointed one of the three com—
missioners of that city to meet with repre-
sentatives of several Southern states in an
attempt to settle their major differences
peaceably. On Feb. 7, 1861, he wrdte Robt. N.
Gourdin of Charleston that the reason why he
and the other two commissioners had not reach-
ed Charleston was that it was feared such a
venture would hinder the work of the Washing-
ton Conference, ,

 

Back in 1859, Oaksmith had proposed to
Domingo de Goicouria that they end the suit

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch, 135
between themselves in order to push a suit a-
gainst the U.S. for losses suffered when the
government seized the Amelia, Magnolia , and
Massachusetts in 1855. Oaksmith owned the two
Tormer vessels and was agent for the latter.
Goicouria had advanced a large part of the
money used to purchase the cargoes of the first
two ships and had a lien on the latter vessel
for a large sum. In 1861, they agreed to com-
promise their differences.

 

 

 

This collection does not reveal very much
about the —- of Oaksmith and

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch. 14
Golcouria, the son of a wealthy Cuban merchant
who had learned something of liberalism while
in school in Europed Rs living in N.Y. at the
beginning of Walker's ascendancy. He offered
his services to Walker with the expectation
that when Nicaragua was conquered they would

try to liberate Cuba. Walker finally accepted

 

his services. In a clipping containing a poem
written for the Cuban cause by Oaksmith while
he was in London in 1873, Mrs. Oaksmith is
quoted as having written that her late husband
had great sympathy for the Cuban patriots and
lost a fortune in “~~ to render them

 
Oaksmith, Appleton, Sketch, 1d
assistance in the 1850's,

 

Before {864 ended, Oaksmith was indicted
as a slave trader (See typed sketch from The
Raleigh News that is at the beginning of the
collection.). He escaped in Sept., 1862 and
fled to Fla. and then to England. The charge

against him was that he had fitted out a ship
to procure Negroes in Africa and take them to
Cuba to be sold as slaves. Later he was to get
revenge against Richard: H. Dana, Jr., the dis-
trict attorney in this case, by being one of

those people who protested so strongly against

 
Oaksmitn, Appleton. Sketch. 16
his appointment as U.S. minister to England
that the Senate refused to confirm his appoint-
ment. Ten years later, President Grant par-
doned him of slave-trading charges. (See U.S.A
Prison Autograph Book, 1861, Fort Warren,Mass.
in the MSS. Dept. of Duke University Library
for a poem written by Oaksmitk on the day he
entered that prison. )

 

 

He is said to have engaged in the blockade
trade after his escape and was tried for sedi-
tion and convicted. He was committed to Fort
Lafayette, but was later pardoned by Andrew

 
Oaksmito, Appleton. Sketch. 17
Jonnson.

 

Avril, 1864, found Oaksmith in Havana with
his brother, Signey, but by 1866, he was in
England. In 1867, hts ex-wife wrote Pres.
Grant how her former husband had tried to es-
cape being detected, about his deserting her,

his forcing her to sign divorce papers, and
then illegally marrying his step-cousin,
Augusta. Meson of Porthand, Maine, and of her
desire for the custody of their children.

Around the middle of Dec., 1870, Oaksmith

 
Oaksmitn, Appleton. Sketch. 18
Joined with three other men to form a company
by the name of Wm. H. Frear & Co. It was to
carry on a general army and nawy furnishing,
contracting, and mercantile business, with its
chief office being in London.

 

Perhaps it was in 1871 that Oaksmith set-

tled at Hollywood, Catteret county, N.C. Soon
he was working to obtain a charter for the
Midland, N.C.R.R.Co., whose chief objective
was the completing of a continuous railroad
route from Beaufort Harbor to Memphis. Two of
his associates in this venture were two of the

 
Oakgmithn, Appleton. Smita. 19
men, Wm. G. Frear and Geo. F. Hoffman, with
whom he had been connected in England. When
the charter for this company was granted, Oak-
smith was named a member of the first board of
directors, and later became general mamager of
the company.

 

In 1873, Oaksmith sailed for England as
captain of the Proubadour. This was an ill-
fated voyage. Before he left, J.L.Morehead of
Charlotte wrote to him requesting that he try
to get a buyer in England for his plantation.
He said he was tired of free Negroes. This

 

 
Oaksmitno, Appleton. Sketcn, 20
may have been the voyage Oaksmith made to
Great Britain in the interest of the Midland
N.C.R.R.Co. During that year he had some con-
nection with the Lombard Exchange of London,

 

In 1874, he ran on the Democratic reform
ticket in oppoBition to the Ku Klux Klan for a
seat in the N.C.House of Representatives and
was elected. He opposed repudiation of the
state debt. During that same year he secured
the establishment of a postoffice at Hollywood
with his sister-in-law, Ellen Mason as post-

mistress.

 
Oaksmitn, Appleton Sketch. 21

Oaksmith wrote articles and poetry and
sometimes received reauests for copies of
poems, One of these was about his mother-in-
law, Eleanor P. Mason, who had lived in Eng-
land while he and his second wife were over
there and who died at Hollywood, N.C. on Nov.
15, 1874. One of his articles is entitled
"Southern State Debts and the National Curren-
cy System; Their Evils and Their Remedy. A
Financial Essay," 1873. .(See pamphlet Collec-
tion, Duke University Library, or The ‘South-
ern Magazine, Dec. 1893.) ~~

 

 
Oaksmitn, Appleton, Sketch. c ee

When Vance came out in 18”’6 for re-elec-
tion fo the governorship of N.C., Oaksmith
gave him his support and was chosen president
of the Tilden and Vance club in Morehead City.
In a letter to Tilden he expressed the view
that the only hope for the South lay ina
Change of government.

 

In April, 1876, Oaksmith tendered his re-
signation as general manager of the Midland
R.R.Co. He was still trying to collect from
the govt. for damages suffered when his two
ships were seized in 1855. (See Reports of

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketch co
Committees, lst sess., 44th Cong., 1875-6,
report no. 420.)

 

 

During that year he also found a document
signed by Richard Caswell and 185 other prom-
inent North Carolinians which he thought was
the original copy of the first declaration of
independence set forth in the Colonies. He de-
cided that it was written either late in 1774,
or in 1775, but Lyman C. Draper, to whom he
sent a copy, stated that it was impossible for
him to establish its date.

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. Sketecn, 24
Alvin Oaksmith of Patchague, N.Y. tried

unsuccessfully in 1877 to get his brother Ap-
pleton to go to Kansas with him. Although Ap-
pbeton was suffering from poor health he was
still trying different schemes for making mon-
ey. He said that he had lost fortunes in N.Y.,
Liverpool, and London. One of the schemes
which he had in mind was the establishment of
a cotton factory at Newport, N.c. At this
time, he was president of the Hollywood Agri-
cultural Association. In Nov., 1877 he went to

N.Y, to make preparations for the formation

 

 
Oaksmitn, Appleton. Sketen,. 20

of the Beaufort Marine R.R.Co. He succeeded

in getting both this and the N,C.Navigation Co-
organized, John W. Pelletier was made president
of the latter company.

 

The next year, Oaksmith failed to get a
contract for removing obstructions from the
Neuse. He recommended to Gov.-elect Thos. J.
Jarvis that a grand trunk railroad be built
across N. C.

The year 1879 was one of deepest tragedy
for him. On July 4, hbs four daughters were

 
Oaksmith, Appleton. sketch. 26
arowned; his first wife gave unfavorable in-
formation about him to a Northern newspaperman
and the article which followed was republished
in The Raleigh News of July 11; he was accused
of being the father of an illegitimate child;
his brother, Sidney, who had been associated
with an art gallery in Havana, died; he was

 

 

very much in need of money; his brother Alvin
wrote that he did not believe he could collect
any of the Nicaraguan claims since Walker was
not recognized by any government, and his and
his wife's health was very poor for a long
time after the  @ of their daughters.

 
OVaksmitno, Appleton. Sketch, ev
The birth of another daughter during the year,

however, probably brought some sunshine into
their lives.

 

After Vance went to the Senate in 1879,
Oaksmith sought unsuccessfully to obtain an
appointment through him. From this collec-
tion it. appears that his last years may have

been spent largely in looking after his land
and ralliroad interests. He died sometime be-
tween 1883 and 1897.

? items and 1 vol. added, 3-30-67, are from

the John R. Kilby Papers, where they were

 
Oaksmith, Appleton 49
obviously out of place. Appleton Oaksmith was
interested in Democratic politics in North
Carolina and kept a number of clippings, most o
which he mounted in a volume, 1880-1884. These
clippings analyze political organization from
the township level at Beaufort to the national
activities of the Democratic Party.

The document involved in this addition is a
proxy given Oaksmith for voting at any meeting
of the Democratic Executive Committee of
Carteret County.

Among the unmounted clippings are a eulogy

 

 
Oaksmith, Appleton 50
of James Rumley of Bauufort, N.C., made by
Oaksmith in 1881, statements concerning his
first wife from whom he was divorced, and
references to the death of his children by
accidental drowning.

A statement concerning the debt of Carteret
County incurred when it aided the Atlantic and
North Carolina R.R. begins the volume of
clippings. The plan of organization of the
North Carolina Democratic Party in 1880 is fol-
lowed by detailed lists of names of local and
state Democratic committees, of justices of the

 

 
Oaksmith, Appleton 51
peace, and of magistrates. Clippings follow on
the voting in various North Carolina counties
in 1880, the State Democratic Platform in 1882,
and the State Democratic Convention of 1884 wit
its platform. On the national level, the
Democratic Platform and the balloting for the
presidential nomination in 1884, Democratic

 

presidential nominations for 1864-1884, and the
composition of the First Congressional District
Executive Committee are noted in the clippings.
Appleton Oaksmith was elected permanent
chairman of a Committee of 100 on April 29,

 
Oaksmith, Appleton Sz
1884, to bring harmony among the Democrats of
Carteret County.

The party nominees in 1884, Alfred Moore
Scales for Governor and Charles Manly Stedman
for Lieutenant Governor, have brief biographica
tributes (pp. 52-55).

6 items added, 6-24-68: Financial papers
concerning Appleton Vaksmith's shipping inter-
ests and a document granting him full ownership

of the ship White Squall.

store at Hollywood. There are also several

pages of accounts for agricultural laborers,

The Wetmore family as-well as the Ogden
family is prominently represented in this
collection. William Wetmore married Anna Ogden,
daughter of Jacob Ogden of Hartford and later
of New Haven, Conn. After her death he married

her sister Jerusha. Wetmore, a native of
Middletown, Conn., was a successful businessman
in Hartford before he became in 1804 the land
agent of the Western Land Company of which

Ogden Family

 

Jacob Ogden, after suffering serious
financial reverses in Hartford, moved to New
Haven and established a hotel known by the name
of the Coffee House. According to a family
record it became the most popular and fashion-
able one in the city. His son Jacob, Jr.,

became a commission merchant in Havana and was
said to have invested $2000 and possibly six
Negroes as half interest in a coffee plantation
in Cuba. He left there to seek additional
financial help butdied at sea. The family

 
Ogden Family 4°
suspected he was murdered by some treacherous
friend to whom he had intrusted a large amount
of property. He had married Mary Harding of
Boston and left one child Sarah. His widow died
a few years later, and her mother surrendered
Sarah to the Ogden family in New Haven. She was
then nine years of age. In 1826, the year after
her grandfather died, she journeyed from New
Haven to Stow to live with her Uncle William and
Aunt Jerusha Wetmore. She described the trip in
a letter of Oct. 9, 1826, to her aunts in New

 

 
Ogden Family

Haven. She continued to write to her aunts,
detailing much information about the elder
William Wetmores and their children, and
expressing gratitude for what her aunts had done
for her and how she missed New Haven. Their
sons William and Henry developed Cuyahoga Falls
near Stow, and became successful founders and

 

operators of paper, flour, oil, and sawmills.
A print of Henry's house in Cuyahoga Falls shows
that its owner was affluent. William and his
wife Lydia are mentioned in William D. Ellis,

The Cuyahoga.

 

 
Ogden Family 6 |:
A description of the initial relationship of

the Wetmores with their Indian neighbors is
given in the sketch of William Wetmore in Volume
1 of the genealogy and also in The Cuyahoga.

A letter of Oct. 7, 1812, from William and Anna
Wetmore reveals that they then had reason to
fear the Indians in that area. They described

 

 

recent fighting between the forces of General
William Henry Harrison and the Indians and
British, and stated that the area east of the
Sandusky was then free of Indians. Wetmore held

 
Ogden Family ie
several offices in Ohio, including a judgeship.
In April, 1829, Sarah married Dr. Silas Reed,
a graduate of the medical school in Cincinnati
and a native of Ohio. After their marriage he
as well as she wrote to her aunts in New Haven
and to their brother, David L. Ogden, a
minister. Reed practiced medicine in Union Town

 

and Middlebury before they moved to Cincinnati
in 1832. Obviously from their letters they
rapidly became well acquainted in medical and
social circles and were well pleased with their

 
Ogden Family

 

prospects in that city. A cholera epidemic
occurred soon after they moved to Cincinnati,
and that led to his practice growing faster

than he had anticipated. In 1833 he started the
Western Medical Gazette. During the fall of
that year the Reeds lost their young son, and in
1837, Sarah died leaving a daughter, Isabella,
who had been born in 1834. The letters that
both Sarah and Silas wrote to the Ogdens after
the death of their son and the letters Silas
wrote to them after the death of his wife con-

 

 
Ogden Famil cd
tain length%y expressions of bereavement. All
of Sarah's letters deal largely with personal
and family matters, but Silas's letters often
contain information of broader interest as most
of the subject cards for this collection reveal.
In the fall of 1837, Reed's twenty-year-old
brother, who had come to St. Louis to join him

 

in business, died of dysentery. Both the noted
physician Daniel Drake, who became Reed's
friend, and Reed diagnosed Sarah Reed's final
illness as abdominal typhus.

 
Ogden Family 10
Dr. Reed decided to give up the medical
journal and quit his practice after Sarah died.
He became involved in the controversy over the
establishment of a second medical college in
Cincinnati.. He was a real estate and mill
developer in Shawneetown, I11l., on the Ohio
River. He also managed after a tough fight to

 

get the appointment in 1843 as head of the office
of Surveyor for two large states. Presumably
they were Missouri and Illinois.

 
Ogden Family il

 

On Apr. 16, 1841, Reed wrote to the Misses
Ogden that he had married Miss Henrietta Maria
Rogers of Gloucester, Mass., who was ten years
his junior and with whom he was highly pleased
as his wife and stepmother to his daughter.
There is a break in his letters in the col-
lection between 1843 and 1871, the date of his
last letter in the collection.

In addition to the two volumes of genealogy
that contain significant information about the
careers Of various families, there are two

 
Ogden Family 12
versions of David L. Ogden's memoir of his
mother, Jerusha (Rockwell) Ogden, and a letter
of advice written to Sarah F. Ogden on Nov. 22,
1814, by Joshua Thomas of Boston.

Multnomah County, Oregon

 

Egbert Samuel Oliver, educator and writer,
was born in Oregon, December 27, 1902. When
ready for college, he enrolled at the Univer-
sity of Washington in Seattle. He received
an A.B. degree in 1927 and an M.A. in 1929 in

English literature. The fall of 1929 he began
to teach as an Instructor in English composi-

tion at Willamette University, a small Method-
ist school in Salem, Oregon. In mid 1931-1932

 
Oliver, Egbert Samuel 2
he was asked to teach, with a day's notice, a
course in American literature. With no back-
ground in American literature he relied heavi-
ly on Pattee's Century Readings in American
Literature. The following summers he enrolled
in American literature seminars at the Univer-
sity of Washington and read everything in
American literature he could find. By 1938

he felt reasonably comfortable in American
literature and returned to the University of
Washington to work for a Ph.D. which he

 

 

 
Oliver, Egbert Samuel 3

received in 1939. He returned to Willamette
and expanded the American literature program.
From 1950 to 1955, Oliver was first an assist-
ant then later an associate professor with the
General Extension Division of the Oregon State
System of Higher Education. In 1955 Oliver
moved to Portland State University, Portland,

 

Oregon, as chairman of the English Department.
There he developed the American literature
program to where the number of upper division
and graduate courses in American literature

 
UlLlver, BODeEIT dSallluer
exceeded the number in English literature.

As a Fulbright lexturer to India during
1956-1957, he offered the first course in
American literature ever to be taught in any
Indian university. He returned as a visiting
professor to India in 1965 and 1971. Since
1972 Oliver has been Emeritus Professor of

 

English at Portland State University. Since

his retirement he has busied himself with

travel and the writing of local history.
Among his publications are as author

 
Oliver, -Egbert Samuel 5
Readings for Ideas and Form (1935); Studies

in American Literature (1965); American Litera-
ture, 1890-1965, an Anthology (1967); Oriental

These twelve letters were written by
Charles Ollier, English publisher and author,
born in 1788. Ollier entered the publishing
business in 1816 in partnership with his bro-
ther James. He made the acquaintance of Leigh
Hunt and published a mumber of the latter's
works, as well as many of Shelley's. Through
Hunt, Ollier met Keats and undertook to publish
that poet's first volume.(181%) The failure
gf the book caused Keats to reproach Ollier
for inactivity in pushing its sale and to

amily letters of three generation the
Ommanney family between Bedford, England, and
India. The earliest letters are to Edward
Lacon Ommanney, who rose to become a major-
general in service in India, from his father
Edward, and his mother. Major-General Ommanney
was already in India as a young man when the
first of these letters was written in 1830.
His father commented on the changes in

 

 
Ommanney Fdaward L 2
monarchs in France and England and also wrote
that his son Cornthwaite had left the navy. A
letter from the mother in the following year
stated that the family had moved from London to
Bedford to further the education of the two
younger sons remaining at home. Several of the

 

later letters contern the sorrow caused by
Cornthwaite, who became a disgrace to his
parents and brothers. The two younger sons in
1834 and 1835 were sent to Woolwich Military
Academy. By 1833 Major-General Ommanney had
married. After a “eo to England in

 
Ommanney, Edward L,
1841, he and his wife left their children (3
boys "and 2 girls) with the grandparents to be
reared and educated in England. Most of the
letters between the grandmother in England and
her son & daughter in India deal with the
children. In 1842 the grandmother described a

 

wedding, in Jan. 1843 she wrote that the loss

of ships was terrible and gave some details on
the sinking of a ship off the French coast, in
Mar. she wrote that her son Henry in Australia
hoped to invest in land there, in June 1843 the
children had some “sé in their hair and the

treatment was described, in Aug. 1843 she wrote
of trouble among the servants. From 1844 to
1846 the replies of Major-General Ommanney are
more interesting and set forth s plans to
send his oldest son to sea to if that life
wohld suit him,and his efforts to get positions

 

for his sons in the service of the East India
Co. In Apr. 1846 he wrote, his parents that his
brother George had died of cholera in service
in India. The letters resume in 1853 with the
major-general's wife writing about the opportu-
nities in New South r i Australia, and that

her son John was about to leave for Sydney,
Australia, on a "ship" because the steamers
were too uncertain and more expensive. The
major-general was still concerned with posit-
ions for his sons; he planned to send a third
son to Sandhurst and trusted that his wife

would be able to get a cadetship or two during
a visit to England. The final letters are
written by Col. Edward Lacon Ommanney (1834-
1914), the eldest son of Major-General Edward
L. Ommanney. He went to India in 1852. He

served in the Indian e and was appointed

Ommanney, Sir Montagu Frederick. Papers, 1870-
1906. London, England

Sir Montagu Frederick Ommanney (18542-1925),
British administrator and officer of the Royal
Engineers, was the son of Francis Ommanney of
York House, Worcester Park, Surrey. He was
educated at Cheltenham and Woolwich, commis-
sioned in the Royal Engineers in 1864, and

 

promoted to captain in 1878. During 1866-1870
he was on special duty at the War Office and
Admiralty after which he became an instructor
(1871) at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich.

 
Ommanney, Sir Montagu Frederick 2

His close connection with the Colonial Office
began in 1874 with appointment as secretary to
Lord Carnarvon, the Colonial Secretary. In 187
he became Crown Agent for the Colonies and
served until 1900. The Crown Agents acted as
the commercial and financial agents in England
for those colonial governments that did not

 

employ an agent general in London. During 1900
1907 he was Permanent Under Secretary of State
for the Colonies. Other positions included
office in the Royal Colonial Institute and
directorships in the British North Borneo

 
Ommanney, Sir Montagu Frederick .
Company and in the London Assurance Company.
The manuscripts concern Ommanney's career
with the Crown Agents and with the Colonial
Office primarily during the terms of three
Colonial Secretaries - Joseph Chamberlain,
Alfreé Lyttelton, and Lord Elgin, all of whom
are represented by one or more letters. A num-

 

ber of British colonies, especially South Africa
(1879-1906), appear in the correspondence.

On March 8, 1871, George Goschen, President
of the Poor Law Board, reported difficulties
with establishing a smallpox hospital, one of

 
Ommanney, Sir Montagu Frederick 4
which was the illness of Dr. Bridges (apparently
John Henry Bridges, Medical Inspector of the
Local Government Board).

The question of establishing an agent genera
in London for the Cape Colony was the subject
of Governor Sir Bartle Frere's letter of Oct.
18, 1879, to Sir Penrose G. Julyan who was one
of the Crown Agents along with Ommanney. Frere
commented about Premier John G. Sprigg and Capt
Charles Mills of the Cape's Colonial Office.

Sir Harry Johnston, Commissioner of the
British Central African Protectorate (Nyasaland

 

 
Ommanney, Sir Montagu Frederick 5
now Malawi) announced his forthcoming trip to
London on March 10, 1896.

Unspecified administrative changes were the
concern of Joseph Chamberlain, the Colonial
Secretary (letter of Apr. 5, 1898). Instruc-
tions and communications with the colonies were
discussed on Sept. 15, 1900, as was a trip to

 

Australia by the Duke of York (Sept. 15,16). On
Oct. 18 Chamberlain made plans for a trip to the
Mediterranean. He was grateful for the work of
Ommanney and the South African Department. during
the Boer War (June 4, 1902). On Sept. 16, 1903

 
Ommanney, Sir Montagu Frederick 6
he secretly reported his imminent resignation
from the Colonial Office, an event marked by
exchanges of commendatory letters on Sept. 17
and 21 and on Jan. 19, 20, 1904.

Lord Milner, the High Commissioner for South
Africa, acknowledged Ommanney's assistance
despite disagreement on. policy (Nov. 28, 1903),
and he criticized the work of Mr. Moor, probably
Sir Frederick Robert Moor, Minister for Native
Affairs in Natal, whose removal was desired by
Lieutenant Governor Sir Arthur Lawley of the
Transvaal. On July 20, 1904, Milner reviewed

 

 
Ommanney, Sir Montagu Frederick Y i
the financial situation of the South African
government and expressed anxiety that the
Liberals might come to power in London and then
upset affairs at the Cape.

On Dec. 24, 1904, Colonial Secretary Alfred
Lyttelton reflected upon the past year and also
commended Ommanney's reply to Hamilton. Sir

 

Montagu's assistance with the new constitution
for the Transvaal was acknowledged on May 8,
1905. South African policy was probably
Lyttelton's concern on Aug. 16, 1905, when he
commented on a draft document by Ommanney and o

 
Ommanney, Sir Montagu Frederick 8

 

Joseph and Austen Chamberlain's and Lord
Selborne's relation to it. The letter of Oct.
10 with reference to Milner and a policy matter
also probably relates to South Africa. Lyttel-
ton's letter dated only Oct. 10 was written in
1903, 1904, or 1905; it concerns Rhodesia and
the British South Africa Company.

Sir Donald Currie, Liberal politician, was
apparently being considered for some position
in Downing Street (Oct. 31, 1905).

On June 4, 1906, Lord Elgin, the Colonial
Secretary wrote about: an invitation from New

 
Ommanney, Sir Montagu Frederick 9
Zealand for a member of the royal family;
General Ridgeway'’s negotiations in South Africa
for the constitutions of the Transvaal and the
Orange River Colony; and the federation of New-
foundland about which he was having correspon-
dence with Lord Grey, Governor General of
Canada.

was an attorney whose chief interest seems to
have been land. . He also engaged in the mercan-
tile and sawmill business, and was connected
with Brightly Kennels and Brightly Stock and

 

Poultry Farm near Goochland, Va,

As early as 1900, Omohundro was the attorney
for the Tax Title Co, of Richmond, later the
Virginia Land and Title Co, He came also to
represent the Old Dominion Real Estate Co, For a
number of years the correspondence is concerned

 
Omohundro, Malvern Hill 2
largely with investigating the possibility of
acquiring delinquent lands in-.a number of coun-
ties in Virginia, the redemption of those lands
by former owners, and the disposition of such
lands, There is also much correspondence about
the repairs on rental property, the collecting

 

of rents, etc,

In 1911, and possibly earlier, there is
correspondence about the consideration being
given to changing the government of Richmond to
that of the commission form, A letter of that
same year from R. W. Massie, President of the

 
Omohundro, Malvern Hill 5
Massie-Morris Lumber Co, of Lynchburg, shows
that he was a partner of Omohundro in speculating
in land in Florida.

The papers relating to farming sometime give
prices of livestock and fowls.

There is material about meetings, etc. of the

about Liberty Loan drives and the American Red

Temair (Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland), and his
wife. He comments on theterm of John Poyntz
Spencer, “ifth Earl Spencer, as Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland, and contrasts it with that of Henry
Herbert, Fourth Earl of Carnarvon,

There are ten letters to Gmond from Sir Henry

Among other correspondents is George Otto
Trevelyan, Second Baronet, who, although Pres-
ident of the Scottish Liberal Association, opposes

 

Home Rule for Ireland (Apr. 16, 1886). William

O'Neal, Horatio G. Papers. Middletown,
Frederick County, Maryland

 

H. G. O'Neal, merchant, was a partner’ in the
firm of O'Neal, Richmond & Co. that operated a
general store at Middletown. He is presumably
the Horatio G. O'Neal who was county surveyor

in 1830 and who laid out the town of Point of
Rocks in 1835. Middletown is centrally located
in Middletown Valley between South Mountain and
Catoctin Mountain. Its central location in a
well cultivated valley encouraged a thriving

 
O'Neal, Horatio G.

 

business, especially in the early days before
stores were established in other places in the
valley. Middletown and H. G. O'Neal are noted
in: T. J. C. Williams and Folger McKinsey,
History of Frederick County Maryland (Baltimore,
1967), I, 321-323, 603.

 

The volume is oO! Neal, Richmond & Co.'s Day-
book, 1820-1823 (194 pp.), from their general
store at Middletown. The entries list customers
and itemize their purchases by name, quantity,
and price. Some customers are identified by

 
O'Neal, Horatio G.

 

trade, race, relationships, etc.

The Daybook is identified with O'Neal,
Richmond & Co. by a loose sheet found within the
volume. This sheet is for Lewis Michael's
account with O'Neal, Richmond & Co. on Sept.
23, 1821, and its contents are entered in the

Daybook on that date. There was an earlier
partnership known as "H. G. O'Neal & Co. or Old
Concern" (entry Jan. 4, 1821) and usually listed
as "Old Concern" in transactions scattered
throughout the volume. One of the loose fi-

 
O'Neal, Horatio G,.

 

nancial papers dated 1818-1820 also bears the
Same name for the company. A notation on the
first sheet indicates still another partnership
in 1819: "H. G. O'Neal, F. Richmond & J. Rams-
burgh." Francis Richmond whose transactions,
like O'Neal's, are numerous was apparently the

partner. The accounts are consistent from Dec.
11, 1820, through Jan. 5, 1823, with some
missing pages. There are random notations of
1819 and 1823-1824 on the end papers. The
entries for 1823-1824 on the last back endpaper

 
O'Neal, Horatio G. 5

 

have scattered dates and lack posting notations.
Their different form suggests either random
entries or another change in the ownership at
that time.

There are scattered entries for purchases by

Two of them are accounts from the store. The
third item is a brief itinerary, July, 1817, for
a trip to Ohio from Middletown by Joseph Rams-

burg and David Bowles. Their route as recorded
here was through Maryland and Pennsylvania to
near Wheeling, West Virginia. Washington,
Pennsylvania, is commented upon, and other
places are noted. This trip probably represents
emigration (or interest in it) to Ohio, which
was then being settled.

O'Neale, John. Papers. Laurens County, S.C.,
and Greene County, Indiana

 

John O'Neale (1773-1841), a Quaker leader
and farmer, was born near Mud Lick, Laurens
County, S.C. He lived in that county until 1817
when he moved northward with his family, set-
tling in Greene County, Indiana, by 1820. His

social views, particularly with regard to

slavery, were responsible for this migration.
The collection consists of: a manuscript

copy (164 pp.) of the "Memoirs of John O'Neale:"

 
O'Neale, John 2

 

a typescript of the manuscript; a printed pros-
pectus for its publication; and a letter of ex-
planation about the manuscript. This memoir
was apparently not published.

The "Memoirs" include a history of the family
in America and stories of the Revolutionary War
in South Carolina. Slavery was discussed in
great detail through most of the work, particu-
larly the slave trade, treatment, laws, and
attitudes toward slaves. Distressed at the
effects of slavery on his children, 0'Neale

 
O'Neale, John

to Indiana where he was active in a chure
on the White River. The hardships of the jour-
ney were discussed. Throughout the memoir there
are references to agriculture, morality, Metho-
dists, prophecy, establishment and maintenance
of the Quaker churches at Bush River, S.C., and
White River, Indiana, and the evils of war, li-

 

quor, and tobacco. There are several pages about
Priscilla Hunt Cadwalader, a Quaker minister at
White River, Indiana, including a poem dedicated
to her by Sidney Averile. The memoir concludes

 
O'Neale, John 4

 

with a poem by the author and an address by him
to the Benjaminville School in 1871. Three
pages, 80 and 117-118, are missing from the
memoir.

The memoir was apparently written in 1872 by
John's son Cary. The author refers several
times to John as his father, and a note written

by John to Cary (see page 149 of the manuscript
copy), was claimed to have been sent to the
writer of the manuscript.

This collection consists of two letters
written in 1862 by Charles and A. F. O'Neil to
their father John O'Neil. It is presumed that
these two men were brothers since their letters
were purchased together and Charles's letter
includes a reference to his brother "Frank".
Both men are named in the List of Officers of
the U.S. Navy; Charles is listed in Records of
Living Officers of the U.S. Navy and Who Was
Who in America (1897-1942),

A. F. O'Neil served for a time on the U.S.

1862, described conditions on his ship and the
progress of the war along the Mississippi River,
He praised his former captain, John Ancrum
Winslow, and the present commander, Lt. Wilson.
He deplored the conditions on his ship, however,
and expressed the desire to be transferred as

 

soon as possible,
Charles O'Neil began a letter to his father
on Oct. 8, 1862. After writing several pages,

he remarked that since he did not know when he
would be able to send his letter from his ship,

 
O'Neil, John
he would write to his father in the form of a

journal. The letter thereafter continues
intermittently until after Oct. 21. On Oct. 8,
he noted the movement of his ship, the Tioga,
during a cruise to the Bermuda Islands beginning
on Sept. 26. He described the islands and
commented on the Union and Confederate sentiment
bn the islands,

On Oct. 9, he commented on a dispute with
the British authorities on St. George's Island.

Exchanges with British ships is described

on Oct. 10;

The entry for Oct. 11 notes that a ship
passed by them unnoticed during the night.
Presumably, it was a blockade runner or Confed-
erate ship.

His ship and the others in Admiral Charles
Wilkes's squadron left Bermuda on Oct. 12. By
Oct. 15, their destination was still unknown,

 

though O'Neil speculated that they might be
headed for the Bahamas,
On Oct. 17, the ships reached the Bahamas

where they stayed until Oct. 19 when they left
for Havana. He described that city. He also

This collection contains material, mostly pamphlets,
relating primarily to the Order of Railroad Telegraphers
(AFL), various railroad companies, and telegraphers.

The nature of this collection is miscellaneous because
it contains mainly printed and mimeographed material

collected by the donor, H, L. Keller, in his capacity as
General Chairman of the Order of Railroad Telegraphers,
Division No. 93 in Plant City, Florida.

There are agreements between the Order of Railroad
Telegraphers and several companies, notably the Reading

Company, the Central of Georgia Railway Company, and the
Denver and Rio Grade Western Railroad Company. Mimeo-
graphed schedules of wages and rules for the Atlantic
Coast Line Railroad Company as.well as for the Charleston
and Western Carolina Railway Company are two of the
earlier items in the collection. Included also are a
contract in 1949 between the Western Union Telegraph
Company and the AFL, and a pamphlet concerning laws
affecting railroad telegraphers.

These manuscripts apparently constitute a
complete set of minutes and reports from the
general conference in 1860 of the Original Free

Will Baptist Church of North Carolina. The
conference met on November 8-10, 1860, at Post
Oak Meeting House in Craven County. The records
include both the conference minutes and the re-
ports by letter from each local church.

 
Original Free Will Baptist Church, North
Carolina,

There are two sets.of conference minutes.
Together they include: minutes of the sessions
on November 8, 9, and 10; a statistical report
that itemizes the year's record for each local
church; a list of delegates to the conference;
and a list of ministers with their addresses.

The letters from the local churches are the
basis for the reports in the minutes. Pastors
and clerks usually sign these brief reports to
the conference. There are letters from forty-
two churches in Beaufort, Craven, Duplin, Greene,

Lenoir, Martin, Pitt, Wayne, and Wilson Counties
The minutes list forty-five churches, and the
conference received letters from forty-two; thus,
the file of reports is complete for those receiv.
ed by the conference.

An undated manuscript is the text of a motion

 

that appears in the 1860 minutes. It calls for
the establishment of a fund or funds for the
payment of visiting preachers.

Printed minutes from some other annual con-
ferences are available in the Divinity School
Library. The minutes for 1860 include a resolu-

The Original Free Will Baptists operated in
North and South Carolina. The distinction
between them and other Free Will Baptists is
summarized in the New Schaff-Herzoz Encyclopedia
of Religious Knowledge (New York and London,

Origins of the Dutch Uprising, 1559-1566,
and the Negotiations of 1607-1608.

 

This account of the outbreak or the causes of
the Eighty Years' War (1567-1648) is written
from the point of view of a Catholic sympathizer
of Philip II, King of Spain. The manuscript and
the treaty negotiations of 1607-1608 are both in

French. The manuscript is unsigned and undated.

The paper bears several different watermarks.
The manuscript opens with an explanation of

King Philip's appointment of his haif sister,

 
Origins of the Dutch Uprising, 1559-1566,

and the Negotiations of 1607-1608

Margaretha of Parma, as Regent for the Low
Countries in 1559. The machinery of the admin-
istration, with three councils established to
advise the Duchess of Parma, is described.

But it was Philip's ecclesiastical reforms
which aroused controversy. The creation of new
archdioceses and disoceses, the better to fight
the growing Protestant movement, offended
several Dutch interests. The opposition of the
prelates and clerics, whose incomes or lands

 

 
Origins of the Dutch Uprising, 1559-1566, 3
and the Negotiations of 1607-1608
would be used to support the new order, is reg-
istered in the manuscript. Similarly, the dis-
satisfaction of the nobility-- particularly the
Order of the Golden Fleece-- is reflected in
several of the chapters.

A narration of the crisis and its development

 

follows. The author faithfully reports the
various petitions and letters sent by the League
of Nobles or the Estates to the King and his
responses. The demand for Cardinal Granvelle's

 
Origins of the Dutch Uprising, 1559-1566,

and the Negotiations of 1607-1608

removal-- he was an unpopular servant of the
monarchy-- was accepted by Philip, whose gesture
temporarily appeased the nobles led by William
of Orange and the Count Egmont. Egmont's
mission to Spain is also recorded.

The political truce came to an end in 1566
when Calvinist mobs sacked churches and monas-
teries across the Low Countries. Philip's
decision to implement the Council of Trent's
decisions and his handling of religious matters

 

 
Origins of the Dutch Uprising, 1559-1566,
and the Negotiations of 1607-1608

 

form the principal content of the manuscript
which breaks off before the outbreak of the
war for independence in 1567.

A second manuscript is attached, giving
clauses from the treaties of 1607-1608.

William Ormond (1769-1803) was born near
Kinston, North Carolina, on December 22, 1769.
His parents were wealthy for that time, but he
became a Methodist minister rather than develop-
ing the patrimony left to him. He was admitted

to the ministry on trial in 1791. During the
period, 1791-1803, covered by his journals
he mostly served on circuits in southeastern

Virginia and eastern North Carolina. The two

 
Ormond, William

 

exceptions were the Salisbury Circuit in the
western piedmont of North Carolina and the
Washington Circuit in Georgia that was located
between Athens and Augusta. Ormond died of
yellow fever on October 30, 1803, in Brunswick
County, Virginia. Biographical information
appears in M. H. Moore's Sketches of the

Se of Methodism in North Carolina and
Virginia (Nashville, 1884), pp. 248-253. A
copy of fe biographical sketch is filed with

the collection.

 
Ormond, William

The five volumes of journals date dur ing
July 10, 1791, to December 12, 1792, and
August 16, 1795, to October 4, 1803. There is
a typescript of all five volumes which should be
seae in ardkc to preserve the original, the
manuscript being used to verify the text when
necessary. The journals have not been cataloged
in detail, but the general location of his
activities is identified below.

Ormond began his service and his diary in
1791 on the Tar River Circuit in North Carolina.

*Also available in Divinity School Library.

 

 
Ormond, William
In January, 1792, he was appointed to the

Goshen Circuit which was somewhere near
Wilmington (there is a Goshen Swamp in Sampson
and Duplin counties). There is a break in the
diary between December, 1792, and August, 1795,
during which time Ormond served on the Pamlico
and New Hope circuits. When the diary resumed
in August, 1795, he was on the Sussex Circuit

in Virginia. His subsequent appointments during
the period covered by the diaries were to the

following circuits (the annual conferences

 

 

 
Ormond William 5
met at various times of the year): Trent,
1796; Roanoke (N.C.), 1797; Portsmouth, 1798;
Washington (Georgia), 1799; Tar River, 1800;
Caswell Circuit (Oct., 1800-April, 1801);

Brunswick (Virginia), 1801; Salisbury, 1802;
and Norfolk and Portsmouth, 1803.

A letter between two stewards of the Tar
River Circuit records its guarterly conference
minutes of July 6-7, 1800. In addition to
financial matters, the conference handled four
cases involving members: a lawsuit, two de-
cisions for eventual emancipation of slaves,

 

 
Ormond, William 6
and the Licensing of Edmund Jeter to preach.

A fragment (16 pp.) of a diary of October
12-14, 1824, was written by an unknown person
who was apparently visiting somewhere in
Tennessee, He discussed the prospects for land
purchases in Tennessee and nearby states. This
item was found inside one of Ormond's journals.

Orne, Anders. Papers. Stockholm, Sweden

 

Anders Orne, who was born in 1881, was the
head of public relations in the Swedish Coopera-
tive Society and also a member of its Board of
Directors.

This collection consists of a letter, post-
cards, and pictures. The letter, which is un-
dated, was written by Orne to Mr. Bjorkman,
an editor. The purpose of the letter seems to
be to emphasize Albin Johansson's vital role
in the Cooperative Society. According to Orne,

 
Orne, Anders

it was Johansson, rather than himself, who
created and built up the society in his roles
as head of the department of goods and as a
member of the Board of Directors.

Pictures include those of Orne; Johansson;
and Martin Sundell, who was the Society's sec-
retary and spiritual leader from 1905 until his
death in 1910. There is a photograph of the
office and goods storage house of the Society
in Stockholm,

George Osborn (1808-1891), British
Methodist leader and clergyman, was one of the
Wesleyan Foreign Missionary secretaries in
1857 when he received a letter of March 19 from
Henry Venn, honorary secretary of the Church
Missionary Society. Venn outlined the

 

provisions for the protection of missionary
activity that he and the Society wanted
included in a treaty with China.

Osburn was a Presbyterian clergyman, author,
and map maker. Because of his strong bent to-
ward science, he served for some time as pro-
fessor of natural science at Roanoke College in

Salem, Virginia, in the early years of his
ministry.

The collection contains a letter from Osborn,
dated January 26, 1858, to Swoomstedt and Poe
Publishers. The letter was written during his

 
Osborn, Henry Stafford 2

 

tenure at Roanoke College. The letter concerns
the possible publication of sketches he made of
the Mediterranean and Holy Land, where he
studied the geography and plants of Palestine.
Osborn said the drawings were "botanically and
scientifically correct" and that many advantages
were afforded him by the British Survey Officers
at the Malta Scientific Institute. He said Dr.
Robinson at Union Theological Seminary of New
York City had pointed out mistakes of a botanica
nature in Catherwood's views and geological

 
Osborn, Henry Stafford 3

 

errors in Roberts' works that had been "guarded
against" in his work. Edward Robinson was a
philologist, geographer, educator and Chairman
of Biblical literature at the Seminary from 1837
1863.

Much of the letter proposes different options
to the publishers, indicating to them how they

might have access to the sketches for publi-
cation. He describes in some detail how a pub-
lisher in Philadelphia has suggested having an
album of Palestine views in lithograph form

 
Osborn, Henry Stafford

printed. Osborn's study culminated in the
publication of two works Palestine, Past and
Present (London, 1859) and Plants of the Holy
Land with Their Fruits and Flowers (1860).

(From the Dictionary of American Biography, v. 14,
p. 68)

The letter is written on a printed circular
about Roanoke College where Osborn was listed as
Chairman of the Faculty as well as professor of
natural science. The circular includes a de-
scription of the college's location, its course

 

 

 

 

 

 
Osborn, Henry Stafford

of study and its disciplinary policy. In
addition, it lists faculty members, "professors
extraordinary" and tutition expenses.

Bethany, Davidson Co., N.C.

 

This collection, though small in size, i& a
well-nigh perfect type for studying the activit
ies of a small farmers! subsalliance as 4t func
tioned in North Carolina. John R. Osborne, sec

retary of the sub-Alliance at Bethany in David-
son County, apparently saved every shred of in-
formation connected with his duties. With the

exception of perhans a dozen pieces, every item
of this collection pertains to the activities of

the Bethany sub- a ) no, | The mater-

 
OSBORNE, John R, Sketch, 2
ial consists of manuscript items and numerous
printed circulars, broadsides and catalogues.

In general, the manuscript material contains
letters to Osborne from the secretary of the
Davidson County Farmers' Alliance and correspon-
dence with the State Business Agent of the North
Carolina State Farmers! Alliance. Such items
are included as an invitation from the sub-Alli-
ance of Thomasville, N.C. to the Bethany sub-Al-
liance for a joint meeting "to discuss 'The Good
of the Order'" a letter from a higher alliance
official stating that only "male members clear
On books" could serve oe delegates to the

 

 
OSBORNE, John R, Sketch. 3

Alliance meetings, letters regarding discounts
on farm implements seed etc., and one or two
letters from trustees of the State Alliance. Of
interest, too, is the material concerning the
pass-word of the Bethany sub-Alliance especially
of a communiéation from the secretary of the
Davidson Gounty Farmers! Alliance stating that

 

"Some traitor gave ouf word away and it is char-

ged to adhere-to."

Significant among the manuscript records is
minute book of the Bethany sub-Alliance. This
record covers the activities of the unit from

March 16, 1889 to “eo 9, 1892. The or-

 
OSBORNE, John R, Sketch, 4

ganization began with a membership of 19 and it
highest peak had 68 members. From January 1892
January 1892, according to the minutes, activit
ies of the Be thany sub-Alliance were without the
vigor of the period during 1889 and 1890. The
collection includes also a roll book and three
small account books showing Osborne's expendi-
tures for postage.

Perhaps the printed material is of as much
value as the manuscript; items. In this categor
are numerous blanks for reports to county and
State alliance officials, circulars, broadsides,

rituals, one copy of } proceeding of the N.C,

 

 
OSBORNE, John R, Sketch, 5

State Farmers' Allkance for 1889 and a copy of
the constitution and by-laws of the N.C. State
Farmeps' Alliance.

The collection consists of numerous price
lists, catalogues and handbills of various bus-
iness firms seeking to obtain the patronage of
the Bethany sub-Alliance. These firms include

 

manufacturers and salesmen of fruit trees, farm
implements, clothing, seed, fertilizers, booka
on the Alliance and numerous other items.

Philadelphia. With the poem is a letter from
Mrs. Osgood to Mrs. Mary Pease, probably
Ernest's mother. Although the poem and let-

Osgood, Stephen, Papers, 1861-1865. George-
town, Essex Co., Mass.

Stephen Osgood, merchant tailor of George-
town, Mass., had two brothers, Ward and Charles,
in the Union Army. He sent many boxes to sol-
diers who were friends as well as to these rel-
atives. Their replies compose the bulk of these
papers, most of which were written in 1861-1863,
up to the eve of the Battle of Gettysburg. The
letters are literate and contain humorous pass-
ages, particularly those of Charles Osgood.

His regiment, the 14th Massachusetts Volunteers,

 

 
Osgood, Stephen a
entered Fort Warren, Mass., in June, 1661, Af->
ter it came South it went on guard duty around
Washington in Forts Albany, Tillinghast, and
Whipple, Va., at least until March, 1864. His
letters give a picture of garrison life, begin-
ning with lack of equipment, at Fort Warren,

He comments on fever among troops in the camps
near the Potomac and describes guard duty near
the Long Bridge and Ft. Runyon, Va. Food and
pay, friends, and mud concern the guards at
Arlington, near Lee's home. By June 4, 1862,

 

 
Osgood, Stephen if
Charles Osgood notes the excitement in Washing-
ton at the retreat of General Banks and the fear
of guerillas. The 14th Mass. marches under Col.
Oliver Duff Greene to the Battle of Second Bull
Run, Aug. 29-30, 1862, where it is surrounded by
Confederate Cavalry under Fitzhugh Lee. Lee and
Greene were classmates at West Point and their

 

humorous exchange of words is described by
Charles Osgood. On this march the 14th Massa-
chusetts meets the 2nd N. Y. Heavy Artillery and
sees contrabands rejoicing over the abandoned

 
Osgood, Stephen 4
knapsacks of Union soldiers. Sedgwick's Division
is mentioned on the way to the battle. By March
30, 1863, Charles Osgood describes the construc-
tion of new forts around Washington, giving de-
tails of Fort McClellan. These letters fre-
quently mention Ward Osgood, the brother in the
15th Massachusetts Volunteers.

 

Ward or "Wad" Osgood enters the papers on
Jan. 5, 1862, when he was stationed with Co. D,
15th Massachusetts, at Poolesville, Maryland,
and reports that the U. S. soldiers believe they
could have beaten the Confederates at Ball's

 
Osgood, Stephen 5
Bluff. On Feb. 28, 1862, Ward writes from Gen.
Gorham's Brigade at Harper's Ferry, Va. to des-
cribe the deserted town, the depredations of the
20,000 troops stationed around the town, and a
cavalry raid on Charlestown, Va. Ward Osgood
visits Washington on Mar. 28, 1862, at which ©
time he describes in detail the Patent Office.
He is about to embark for an unknown destinatien,
which proves to be the Peninsula below Richmond.
Corporal Osgood is before Yorktown when he
writes on April 18 and 20 and May 2, 1862, of

 

 
Osgood, Stephen 6
artillery fire, fortifications, guard duty for
General Edwin Vose Sumner at Camp Winfield Scott,
and the "hard time" which Sedgwick's Division is
having.

A notable letter of June 8, 1862, describes
the fighting at Fair Oaks or Seven Pines, where
the 15th Massachusetts relieves the 7th Massa-
chusetts at the center of the Union line. The
very important work of Rickett's Battery (Pa.
Canoneers) in holding this position results in
terrible Confederate casualties,

 

 
Osgood, Stephen 7

On Aug. 30, 1562, Ward Osgood is at Alexan-
dria. Evidently wounded at Antietam, he is in
a Washington hospital on Oct. 16, 1862, when his
brother Charles writes home about him. Boxes by
the 100's come for Thanksgiving, 1862. Ward Os-
good is transferredto the Broad and Cherry Sts.
Hospital in Philadelphia. By Apr. 20, 1863, he
is back with Sedgwick's Division at Yorktown,
Va. Charlie again reports on Ward; this time
(on July 2, 1863) he is at Harrisburg, Pa., just
before the Battle of Gettysburg.

 

 
Osgood, Stephen 8

A number of other Union soldiers write to
Stephen Osgood. J. H. Harvey of the 8th Massa-
chusetts discusses Colonels Jones and Hicks. In
the 12th Massachusetts (the Webster Regiment)
are Isaac Dowling and Capt. David Allen. Isaac
Dowling describes the members of this organiza-
tion on Sept. 8, 1861, while Allen on Nov. 29
tells of guard duty on the Potomac and the
butchery at Ball's Bluff. By Dec. 17, Dowling
is in the hospital at Frederick, Md., with fever,
and he becomes a medical clerk in the Medical
Department of the 12th Massachusetts. He draws

 

 
Osgood, Stephen .
a dreary picture of Camp Hicks in the mud at
Frederick, Md., on Jan. 22, 1862, when he also
tells of his work in the Hospital. By.Aug. 30,
1862, he is at the Fairfax Seminary General
Hospital where he is hospital clerk. This let-
ter gives a good description of the Seminary and
its library.

 

Jim Burlingame Wilder of the 19th Mass. and
C. S. Parker of the band of the 2nd are among
the other correspondents. A letter of Apr. 27,
1863, by T. Nelson from Baton Rouge, déscribes
camp life and castigates northern abolitionists.

In a letter of Oct. 15, 1870, Rossetti
praises Q'Shaughnessy's latest book of poems
and makes a few stylistic criticisms. He states
that he feels that British poetry is becoming
increasingly organized concerning style and
techniaque. In a postscript, Rossetti comments
favorably on O'Shaughnessy's poems "Bisclaveret"
and "Fountain of Tears." He again writes
O'Shaughnessy about "Bisclaveret" (Oct. 18,
1870) and discusses the obscure meaning of the

title of this poem. E

 

 
O'Shaughnessy, Arthur W.E. _ H ak
On Dec. 28, 1871, Rossetti wrote O'Shaughnes-

sy about the latter's new book of short stories.

Rossetti comments on "Yvenec," "Eliduc," and

"The Nightingale." He criticizes O'Shaughnessy

for carelessness and contends that had he devoted

more time to character development, the stories

would have been less obscure and superficial.

 

Rossetti comments upon O'Shaughnessy'’s book

poetry, Music and Moonlight, in a letter dated
Apr. 25, 1874. He again praises O'Shaughnessy's
style and criticizes the poems for vagueness of

 

meaning and purpose,

Timothy H. O'Sullivan (d. 1882), photographer
was one of the most important figures in early
American photography. He worked for Matthew
Brady during the Civil War, and many of the

Brady photographs were taken in the field by
O'Sullivan. He participated in the King Ex-
pedition during 1867-1869 and 1872, the Darién
Survey Expedition of 1870, and the Wheeler
Expedition during 1871 and 1873-1875. He

 
O'Sullivan, Timothy H. 2

 

contracted tuberculosis and died, aged forty-
two, at West Brighton, Staten Island. Bio-
graphical information and many of his photo-
graphs are in: James D. Horan's Timothy
O'Sullivan, America's Forgotten Photographer.»
(New York, 1966); and Joel Snyder's American
Frontiers, The Photographs of Timothy H.
O'Sullivan, 1867-1874 (New York, 1981).

Clarence King's Expedition was officially
entitled the Geological Exploration of the 40th
Parallel. King's plan was to explore a hundred

 

 

 

 
| O'Sullivan, Timothy H. 3

 

mile-wide swath from the eastern slopes of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains across the Great Basin
to the Rocky Mountains, eastern Colorado to the
California line. This collection includes nine
gold-toned photographs, albumen prints, from
King's expeditions in 1868 (1), 1869 (6), and
1872 (2). The scenes are from the states of

Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming.

In 1871 George Montague Wheeler, topographi-
cal engineer, took charge of the survey of the
territory of the United States west of the

 
O'Sullivan, Timothy H. 4

 

100th meridian. The field work involved four-
teen trips during 1871-1879. The primary
object of the survey was the topographical
mapping of the country, much of it largely un-
explored, but the scope of the work eventually
extended to include exhaustive investigation
of geological, zoological, and ethnological

matters. The definitive Report upon United
States Geographical Surveys West of the One
Hundredth Meridian was published between 1875
and 1889. O'Sullivan was a photographer on

 

 

 

 
O'Sullivan, Timothy H. 5

 

several of these expeditions. This collection
includes 26 gold-toned photographs, albumen
prints, from the expeditions of 1871 (18) and
1873 (8). The scenes are from the states of
Nevada, Arizona, California, and New Mexico.
The collection is arranged first by expedi-
tions, secondly by particular years of the

expeditions, and thirdly sometimes by different
series within a year. The King Expedition
is listed first followed by the Wheeler Expedi-

tion.

Some information is filed in folders with
the pictures. Of particular importance are
the Xerox copies of pictures that were used to
identify as O'Sullivan's work a number of un-
labeled photographs. These copies include
illustrations from books about O'Sullivan and
copies of photographs in the collection that
were sent to the National Archives and returned
with annotations.

Quotation marks have been placed around the
titles of photographs only when those titles

titles and titles or descriptions provided

from other sources have not been enclosed in

Thomas McAdory Owen (1866-1920) was an Ala-
bama lawyer and historian. He led the movement
to found the Alabama State Department of Archivs
and History and was an early director.

A loose-leaf notebook contains a bibliography

 

of the works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and a
list of portraits of him. Two items in the
pocket of the notebook are of the same content.
Many of the entries came from a sale catdies of
1916, so the bibliography was compiled sometime

 
 

Owen, Thomas McAdor
between 1916 and Owen's death in 1020. Two o

the items and several pages in the volume are a
list of Tennyson Books that Owen made for send-
ing to dealers so that they could submit price
quotations. He was apparently collecting
Tennyson works either for himself or for the
Department of Archives and History. There also

are notes for a lecture on Tennyson that Owen
gave at a high school in 1909,
This material was cataloged earlier under

Tennyson's name,

Society.

From the collection of anti-slavery papers

 
Oxford. University, Rhodes House Library 2

 

in Rhodes House, Oxfords this selection has been
made. The bulk consists of the Minute Books

of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society,
1839-68, the petitions of the Society for the
period 1839-1850 relating to America and the
American correspondence of the Society to 1863.
The Society became linked with the Tappan wing
of the American movement and was never the
instrument for securing the overthrow of
American slavery which its founders intended.
Nevertheless these papers illuminate the
activities of the British Society and of its
American connections.
