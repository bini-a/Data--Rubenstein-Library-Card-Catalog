Marvin B. Butler, a native of Vermont, lived
in Salem Center, Indiana, when he enlisted in
the 44th Indiana Infantry Volunteers on Sep-
tember 3, 1861. He was elected sergeant and
later promoted to the rank of first lieutenant

and served in the Buell campaign in Kentucky
and Tennessee in 1862 and 1863. His regiment
fought in the battles of Fort Donelson (Feb.

12-16, 1862) and Stone's River (Dec. 31, 1862«

 
Butler, Marvin Benjamin 2
Jan. a 1863). His health failed in 1862 and
he was honorably discharged from service on
May 2, 1863. He returned to Steuben County,
married Harriet M. Fuller, served as county
recorder and auditor, and was elected to the
Indiane legislature. He died on June 17, 1914.
In his old age he wrote My Story of the Civil
War and the Under-ground “Railroad (Huntington,
Ind., 1914), which contains a history of the
4th Indiana Volunteers and a brief biography
of Butler,

This collection consists almost entirely of

Fuller of Springfield, Indiana, Butler's wife-
to-be. Butler writes about his enlistment, his
early reactions to soldiering, and camp life in
Louisville, Kentucky, and Battle Creek, Tennes-

detail, to the Battle of Stone's River and to
forced marches in Buell's pursuit of Bragg
through Kentucky and Tennessee in 1862. Butler
also mentions the recurring illness which led
to his discharge from the army in May, 1863.
His last three letters deal with his impending

marriage and his position as court recorder in
Angola, Indiana. Harriet Fuller's letters to
Butler are personal in nature, but they suggest
some of the activities and the anxieties of life
on the home front for the Union, The collection
also contains one letter from a friend of Miss
Fuller (April 10, 1863) mentioning some maneu-
vers in Grant's Vicksburg campaign,

Percy Archer Butler (1816-1887), British
army officer, was the son of Percy Archer
Butler of Aherlow Castle, County Tipperary,
Ireland. He had a long career in the army.

He joined as an ensign in 1839, became a
captain in 1845, brevet major in 1854, major
in 1855, brevet lieutenant colonel in 1856,
lieutenant colonel in 1858, and colonel in
1862. He was placed on half pay in 1865.

 
Butler, Percy Archer 2

 

He was awarded the Companion of the Bath in
1873, and he retired with the rank of general
in 1881. Butler served with the 28th (Glouc-
estershire) Regiment. He fought in two nota-
ble campaigns, the Sind in 1842-1843 and the
Crimea in 1854-1855. Some later members of
the family hyphenated Archer-Butler, but

neither Butler nor contemporary printed list-
ings used the hyphen.

The collection principally contains two
volumes of Butler's diary. The earliest is

 
Butler, Percy Archer 3

 

his India Journal, 1844-1846, primarily from
his duty at the cantonments at Poona and
Deesa in the Bombay Presidency. His Journal
No. 2, 1854-1855, is from the Crimean War,
and this volume records his service at Varna,
Rumania, and in the Crimea, including the

battles of the Alma River, Inkerman, and the
siege of Sevastopol.

For a history of the 28th Regiment see
David Scott Daniell's Cap of Honour, The
Story of the Gloucestershire Regiment (The

 

 

 
Butler, Percy Archer 4

 

28th/61st Foot) 1694-1950 (London, 1951).
Butler is not listed in the index. There
is little information about the period
covered by the India Journal. The book
provides a good summary of events during
the Crimean War, but nothing like the per-

 

sonal detail of Butler's Journal No. 2.

The military cantonment on the out-
skirts of Poona was among the two or three
major army camps in the Bombay Presidency
in the mid-19th century. It was relatively

 
Butler, Percy Archer 5

 

close to the capital at Bombay. This canton-
ment was thus one of the most important army
bases in India. This situation gives added
interest to Butler's India Journal, 1844-
1846, since most of it dates during his duty
at the Poona cantonment.

The India Journal (259 pp.) dates from
Jan. 1, 1844, to Jan. 1, 1846. Butler
labeled this single volume as Vols. II & III.
Vol. II was for 1844, and Vol. III was for
1845. He referred to "My old book being

 
Butler, Percy Archer 6

 

nearly full;"so there was at least one ear-
lier volume. At the beginning of this book
he philosophized upon the reasons for keep-
ing a journal; see also the Crimean War
Journal, No. 2, pp. 1-2, 250-260.

The India Journal is a good description of

the life of a young officer at the Poona can-
tonment during peacetime. At that time Butler
was an ensign and after promotion in 1845, a
captain. He was unmarried, living first

with a close friend and later alone. The

 
Butler, Percy Archer 7

 

routine of his duties and his social life
among the men and women of the British com-
munity were constant themes. Many individ-
uals and various regiments were mentioned.

Occasionally he gave some significant comment
about persons.

Other major topics were two marches. The

first occurred during April-May, 1845, when
either all or a part of the regiment went

to Mahabaleshwar in the mountains southwest
of Poona for rest at that convalescent

 
Butler, Percy Archer 8
station. Description includes the cities of
Satara and Wai. During that trip Butler met
a Prince Soltikoff of Russia (183-185, 189-
191). The second march occurred when the
regiment was transferred from Poona to Deesa,
a brigade cantonment north of Ahmadabad in
Gujarat. Butler gave a colorful description

 

of the march to Bombay, the journey on ships
up the coast to Cambay, and the march to
Deesa via Kaira, Ahmadabad, etc. The regi-
ment left Poona on Nov. 1, 1845, and arrived

 
Butler, Percy Archer 9

 

at Deesa on Dec. 10.

Another major theme was health conditions.
The regiment was at Sydney, Australia, before
going to India where Butler arrived in
August, 1842. He remarked on Sept. 3, 1845,
that of twenty-seven officers of the regiment

who landed in India only eight were still in
the country. The others had either died or
gone home because of sickness. Part of this
attrition came from the earlier campaign in
the Sind, but fever and cholera were noted

 
Butler, Percy Archer 10
often in the journal. Butler himself had
bouts of fever.

A variety of other occasional topics
occurred in the journal: the Irish situation;
appointments and promotions; balls and other
entertainments; the arrival of percussion

 

rifles in India for use in the regiment; the
alcohol problem among the troops; corporal
punishment, flogging, and discipline; Gov-
ernor Generals Lord Ellenborough and Sir
Henry Hardinge; Sir James Outram; Commander-

 
Butler, Percy Archer £1

 

in-Chief Sir Thomas McMahon; Richard Lalor
Sheil; George Trevor Spencer, Bishop of
Madras; Archdeacon Jefferies of Bombay (p.
176); members of the ruling families of Kol-
hapur and Satara; Parsees; Hindu temples;
wells; a portrait painter named Smart; a

comet; Freemasons; friendship; the nature of
happiness; events in the Punjab; celebration
of the New Year; the local effects of a

bank failure in Sydney, Australia; etc. Con-
sult subject cards for the pertinent page

 
Butler, Percy Archer 2

 

numbers.

Butler noted that he did not usually re-
tain his letters (p. 20).

The India Journal includes marginal nota-
tions made in the 20th century by a later
member of the family, apparently a Mr.
Creaghe, a grandson of one of Butler's sis-

ters. Creaghe owned the journal at one time.
There is a clipping on the history of the
28th Regiment attached to the inside front
cover. The last sheet contains names and

 
Butler, Percy Archer 13

 

addresses of some of Butler's friends.
Butler's Journal No. 2, 1854-1855, records

part of his participation in the Crimean War.

His complete Crimean War Journal comprised

at least five volumes. In a typed note

attached to the first sheet of the India

Journal, Mr. Creaghe stated that he had five
volumes kept by Butler throughout his ser-
vice in the Crimea.

Journal No. 2 (260 pp.) dates from Aug.
17, 1854, to March 31, 1855. At that time

 
Butler, Percy Archer 14

 

Butler was a captain. The contents of the
Journal cover: the assembling and embarkation
of the British and allied forces at Varna,
Rumania (pp. 1-21); the voyage of the huge
fleet to the Crimea (21-32); the landing

north of Sevastopol and march to Balaklava

and positions near Sevastopol (32-52), in-
cluding the Battle of the Alma River (39-47);
and the siege of Sevastopol (52-260), in-
cluding the Battle of Inkerman (71-75, 108-
109). Butler's account is exceedingly

 
Butler, Percy Archer 15

 

picturesque and candid. The rigors and
horrors suffered by the mismanaged British
army during the terrible winter of 1854-

1855 are graphically portrayed. Occasionally
Butler complained directly about the mis-
management (128-129, 143, 183-185, 210-211),

and he credited Dr. Price, a division surgeon,
with courageously exposing abuses and finally
persuading Lord Raglan with the result that
some conditions improved(210-211).

The photograph labeled "Col. P. Archer

 
Butler, Percy Archer 16

 

Butler taken at the Crimea" was attributed
by the dealer to Roger Fenton, noted early
British photographer who was active in the
Crimea during the war. The photograph is

an albumen print. It was attached to the
loose title page of the India Journal. This

page has been placed in a separate folder
so that the photograph can be better pre-
served.

The Miscellany includes: a letter to
Creaghe about Butler's career and the dona-

 
Butler, Percy Archer LT

 

tion of some of his papers to the regimental
museum at Bristol; and a receipt of 1844 for
tax on an inheritance of Helen Archer Butler,
Percy's sister, from the estate of Valentine
Maher of Tullamaine Castle, Co. Tipperary.

had never met Miss Button, but she responded
to his introductory letter and a regular corres

At the time he wrote these letters, Adams

was in the U.S, Signal Corps. Although he

seems to have been involved in several signi-

to his military activities appear in the let-
ters he wrote to Miss Button. He chose instead
to discuss religion, his views on education,
and his tentative plans to study law after his
release from the Army. Well-educated and arti-
culate, Adams was a good correspondent whose
letters are both interesting and amusing.

Byrnes, William. Diary, 1863. Pennsylvania.
1 vol. Sketch.

This is the diary of Lt. William Byrnes,
Co. F, 95th Regt. of Pa. Vols. (He is mentioned
in the Official Records of the War of the Rebel-
lion, Ser. I, Vol. XXXVI, p. 665, as Bing a
Capt. in the same regt. in 1864. )

 

 

He discusses the Army of the Potomac's cam-
paigns at Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and
Rappahannock Station, as well as various picket
actions and skirmishes. He mentions U. S. Gens.
Joseph J. Bartlett, George G. Meade, John Sedg-
wick, and Horatio G. i He mentions

 
Byrnes, William 2
Confederate prisoners, casualties, and troop
movements, but naturally has more to say about
the Union Army, including its camp life, casual-
ties, deserters, discipline, foraging, stragglem
and troop movements.

The 95th Regt. of Pa. Vols retreated to Md.

 

on June 27 and arrived at the Gettysburg battle-
field about 4 o'clock on July 2. ‘Two hours
later it repulsed the Confederate troops con-
fronting it. Byrnes reports some fighting by
pickets, artillery, and sharpshooters on the
3rd. Then "our iine , on two miles in the

Rain was bad on the 4th when the Southern
Army was retreating. On the 5th Co. F burned
"a hospital with tents all filled with rebel

George Gordon Noel-Byron, Sixth Baron Byron
(1788-1824), British poet, left England in
April, 1816, for the continent. At that time he
began e poem of farewell to Thomas Moore that he
later finished and sent to Moore in a letter of

July 10, 1817. A manuscript copy of this poem
has textual variations in lines 10, 14, 17, and
19. - Punctuation and capitalization also vary.

The paper does not have a watermark. The poem

Charles H. Cabaniss , sheriff of Halifax

Cabaniss as sheriff. Howerton was 70 years
old in 1870 and since they worked together
t is possible thathe and Cabaniss were
about the same age. The set seeme of little

Cabaniss was a member of the Central Executive
Committee of Georgia. Judge Irwin was a dis-
tinguished member of the Georgia bar and had

helped codify the laws of that state. On Mar.
24, 1868, Irwin announced his candidacy for the
governorship, but he was disqualified by Gen-
eral George G. Meade, Commander of the Third
Military District, and dropped out of the race.

 
Cabaniss, Elbridge G. i

 

In the letter of Mar. 31, 1868, Cabaniss writes
about the preparation and distribution of
printed tickets for the next election when the
people would be voting for or against the pro-
posed state constitution as well as electing
local and state officials. He also tells Irwin

that he knows of no opposition to him in that
part of the state, but advises how he should
deal with the attacks he is receiving.

The 1869 letter expresses Cabaniss's fear
that if the black legislators who had been

 
Cabaniss, Elbridge G. 4

 

expelled were not reseated in the legislature
that Georgia would again be put under a pro-
visional government. He suggests that those
who occupy seats that blacks had held resign
and the blacks be reseated by the Central Exe-
cutive Committee. He says he favors this not

because he supports their holding office, but
because he wants to get the state from under
Radical rule. He says he does not fear that
blacks will get into office thereafter since
the "wealth and intelligence of the whites will

surely rule and not the ignorance of the Afri-
can."

Septimus D. Cabaniss was born Dec. 18, 1815,
in Montgomery Co., Alabama. He became a lawyer
and settled in Huntsville. In 1861 he served
in the Legislature. His friend and fellow

Huntsville lawyer, Richard Wilde Walker, was
serving in the Alabama Senate when he wrote to
him on Nov. 23, 1872, about the chaotic situa-
tion and uncertainty within the State Govern-
ment as a consequence of the recent elections

 
Cabaniss, Septimus D. 2

 

and organization of two legislatures. He says
that Governor David Peter Lewis has the power
to recognize the body of which he is a member
as the legitimate Legislature, but that it is
feared that he will recognize the group led by
Lewis E. Parsons as the Legislature. He added

that if this happened it would be futile to
seek relief through the courts because the
judges were all Radicals. As to the race for
the U. S. Senate, he says it has been over-
shadowed by the state elections. He does men-
tion, though, three r are his competitors

 
Cabaniss, Septimus D. 3
for nomination to the U. S. Senate.

The Legislature of which Walker was a member
and which he called the legitimate one was in
session in the Capitol and the "revolutionary
body" was sitting in the U. S. Courtroom.

Cable, George Washington. Papers, 1879-1922.
Northampton, Hampshire Co., Mass. and New
Orleans, Orleans Parish, La.

 

George Washington Cable (1844-1925) was born
in New Orleans, La., where he made his home
until 1835 when he moved to Northampton, Mass.,
a location more congenial to his liberal racial

views and one closer to the centers of literary
activity. Cable was a philanthropist and
reformer as well as a novelist. The papers in
this collection, however, reveal very little
about his many activities. They are generally

 
Cable, George Washington 2
personal or routine in nature.

The most significant items are the letters
written by Cable to Robert Underwood Johnson
who worked closely with Cable on articles for
the Century magazine. They contain references
to his literary career as well as to more
personal matters. Cable's affection and

 

respect for his editor are expressed in a lette
of Nov. 23, 1913, to George Arthur Plimpton.
The remainder of the correspondence deals
principally with speaking engagements and
routine matters. These letters were written by

 
Cable, George Washington 3
Cable to such men as Clarence Clough Buel,
William Carey, and George Arthur Plimpton.

l item added, 11-14-67. A letter to Miss
Helen Parsons, Dec. 16, 1908, from Cable who
expressed his gratitude for her letter of
condolence. This item is a Xerox copy of a
letter in tne possession of Prof. Arlin Turner,
Duke University.

2 items added, 12-9-70: Letters from Cable
concerning personal matters. The first, dated

November 25, 1896, includes comments on plans

 

 
Cable, George Washington 4
or a trip to Syracuse, while the second, writ-
ten on November 20, 1919, is a note of thanks
to a Mr. Waldo.

2 items added, 5-25-72: A letter from Cable
to an unidentified gentleman (June 14, 1886) and
a postcard from him to Richard Watson Gilder
(August 26, 1887). In the first item, he de-

 

clined to write articles for a proposed Ameri-
can biographical dictionary. He also commented
on the extent to which he felt Charles E. A.
Gayarré's work was underrated in Louisiana. The

 
Cable, George Washington 5

 

card written to Gilder concerns an article
Cable was preparing for The Century magazine.

2 items added, 2-5-73: A picture and a
manuscript. The picture of Cable is an en-
graving by Timothy Cole of the painting by
Abbott Henderson Thayer. Cable's signature
cut from the close of a letter is attached to

 

the picture. Included also is a one-page,
incomplete, handwritten manuscript of a story
about a man, Richling, in New Orleans.

Cable, George Washington 2

This is a collection of the letters of George
Washington Cable, and a manuscript of a chapter
of one of his novels, Dr. Segvier. The letters
are most abundant for the years 1885-1891. One
letter of July 11, 1884 was written by Cable to
Samuel L. Clemens, thanking Clemens for finding
a place for them (Cable and his wife) to stay
in Simsbury, Conn.

For the most part, the letters were written
by Cable to the editors of The Century -
Richard Watson Gilder and Robert U. Johnson,
especially- and concern the final editing and
publication of some of his short stories and

 

 

 
Cable, George Washington 3
novels. The letters of 1886 speak of Carancro
and Grande Pointe - stories which Cable wrote
Gilder he wanted to be the best he had ever done
The letters of 1888-89 mention his plans
regarding the publication of his Strange True
Stories of Louisiana. In 1889 Cable considered
dramatizing his story Bonaventure, and wrote

 

 

 

 

 

Gilder (July 13, 1889) that he would value the
opinion of the famous actor Joseph Jefferson.
Jefferson's opinion proved to be unfavorable
(Aug. 16, 1889).

Some mention is made in the letters to
Cable*s work as a reformer. He refers (June 4,

 
Cable, George Washington 4

 

1886) to the problem of southern prisons; to
the Negro problem (Feb. 19, 1889); to criticism
of himself by southern newspapers (Dec. 26,
1889); and to the fact that his reform articles
were always non-political (Feb. 24, 1891).

Two letters mention illness in the Cable
family: his wife's (Dec. 21, 1901) and his own
(May 10, 1910). There are a few letters to
admirers and to persons seeking autographs.

Thomas Cadell, Sr. (1742-1802), and Thomas
Cadell, Jr. (1773-1836), were booksellers and
publishers in London, England.

On May 16, 1775, Dr. Abraham Rees, cyclo-
paedist, noted financial arrangements of a sub-

scription lottery.

On Aug. 19, 1795, Joseph Warton, literary
critic, wrote about his edition of Ihe Works of

items added, 9-21-70; Eleven Letters o

History of Great Britain During the Reign of
een Anne. Nine letters are Somerville Ss,
and two are drafts of replies from Cadell and
Davies. Andrew Strahan, M. P. and printer,

 

 

was an intermediary between Somerville and
Cadell and Davies, a relationship apparent in
the preceding letters. Those of Dec. 20, 1808,

and Feb. 14, 1809, were addressed directly to

 
Cadell, Thomas, Sr. & Jr, ra

Strahan who was to arrange with Cadell and
Davies about the publication and advertisement
of | Observations on a Passage in the Preface
to Mr. Fox s Historical Work, Relative to the
Character of Dr. Somerville as an Historian.

On Dec. 23, 1808, Mr. Somerville, probably one

with the compensation paid to them, and there
is a letter from one of them -- John Pye,

There are references to three other works
by Bayley, at least two of which were never

Oct. 17); and a two-volume edition of letters

of royal and distinguished persons (Jan. 12,

The papers of omas Cade -1& 5 S
son Thomas (1773-1836), and William Davies
(d. 1820), reflect the history of this famous
firm of London ‘Booksellers and publishers, who
were allies of Blackwood's of Edinburgh. The
firm began in 1739 when the first Thomas Cadell

 

of Bristol started his bookselling and publish-
ing business. His son, the second Thomas, went
to London in 1758. He became the partner of the
famous Andrew Millar in 1765. This second
Thomas Cadell begins the papers in 1783 when Dr.

 
Cadell, Thomas,II, and Davies, William 2
George Armstrohg, founder of the first dispens-
ary for children in England, writes concerning
copies of the enlarged second edition of his
book, Essay on the Diseases Most Fatal to In-
fants. In 17953 Thomas Cadell IlI and William

Davies became partners in the firm, From this

 

time till 1813 William Davies was the director
of the business. Benjamin Thomson, Count Rum-
ford, the American British scientist, philan-
thropist, and administrator, writes to Mr Davies
in 1797 concerning the publication of his seventh
essay. He refers to the book binding of the

day, suggesting improvements. (Cadell and lavies
finally published his collected Essays in 1804.)
About 1800 Dr, John&jiken, physician and editor
of the Athenaeum, was a reader for Cadell and
Davies, He reviewed a poem for them. (See his
papers in the Trent Collection, )

 

The eminent Scottish physician, William Buch-
an (1729-1805), writes Cadell and Davies in
1798 urging them to print a new edition of his
Domestic Medicine, Dr. Buchan again wrote to
Mr. Davies in 1802 to say he had prepared his
manuscript Medical Advice to Mothers for publi-

cation. He states he has turned his Treatise
on the Venereal Diseases over to his son br.
Alexander Peter Buchan (1764-1824). The latter,
physician to the Westminister Hospital, London,
had offered a book on sea bathing to Davies in
a letter of July 10, 1800, (See Trent Picture

poets, perhaps the most outstanding of which was
Rohert Burns. The first comprehensive edition
of his works was edited by Dr. James Currie
(1756-1805), and published by Cadell and Davies.
Dr. Currie, who was an advocate of hydrotherapy,
published hie own Medical Reports, 1797 to 1805,

This is a large collection of letters,
legal documents, bills and receipts, account
books and various other items, chi@fly of a
business nature, covering the years from
1783-1940. They concern the interests of the

 

Cain family whose center was Davie County,
N.C., Daniel Cain, his son Patrick H. Cain,
and Patrick's sons, Dr. John M. Cain, Robert
L. Cain, Marshal C. Cain, their families and
relatives, business associstes, etc.

Daniel and “oe were Closely

 
ain, Patrick H, 2
associated with the Cheshire family. For a

time Thomas Cheshire and Patrick Cain ran a
general store in Macksville. Patrick was a
man of rather wide interests. In 1853-1855 he
traveled through §.C..and Ga. selling tobacco.
Later he bought and sold land as well as goods

 

of all kinds. He beeame executor and adminis-
trator of many estates, most of them small

and as such was involved in many cases brought
before the courts. His son, Dr. John M. Cain,
who became his father's administrator, also
administered other “oe and like his father,

 
Coin Patrick H, 3
was involved in cases of indebtedness in the
N.C. courts.

In addition to these business interests,
Patrick owned and operated a distillery for
the making of brandy from fruit juices, and the
family also engaged at times in the distilling

 

and sale of whiskey.

Patrick Cain and two at least of his sons
were Republicans, subscribed for Republican
néwspapercs, and were more or less involved
in politics, both local and state, after the
Civil War, Ae moo" in the N.C.

 
Cain, Patrick H. 4
Assembly, Patrick was especially interested
in the extension of public reads in Davie and
Rowan counties and in the efforts from 1881
through 1886 to have the Stock Law requiring
the fencing of land repealed.

Patrick Cain's wife was Susan Chedire,

 

a @aughter of Thomas Cheshire. Their sons
attended the University of N.0. and one,

Dr. John M. Cain, was a graduate of the "Gollege
of Physicians and Surgeons at Baltimore. He

and his brother Marshall were men of some

and business interests.

Among the letters are a number of special
interest. The earliest were written by a
William H. Stedman to his cousin Thomas H.
Cain; one from Petersburg, Georgia, in April,
1924, two from Clarksville, Georgia on Feb.16

 

and Dec, 11, 1827. He describes rather vividly
his impressions of the Georgians, their char-
acter, social customs and manners, and other
political opinions and preferences as well:as
the presidential possibilities in the other
southern. dates and “é North, He mentions

 
Cain, Patrick H. > 8
Calhoun, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, John
Quincy Adams, and William H. Crawford, "the
darling of the Georgians."

Letters from 1843 to 1856 describe the
life of several schools or academies for girls.
One can get some idea. of the schools of the

 

times also from a list of books sold in 1850
from the estate of a teacher, W.J. Little.

Two letters written in 1855 and 1856 by
John W. Cheshire describe the life at Normal
College, later Tranity, and several from Robert

 
Cain, Patrick H. 7
L. Cain, Cheshire’ cousin, written between 1871
and 1880, give interesting details of life at
the University of North Carolina.

One letter of 1869 written to "Cousin
Lizzie" by "Cousin Branch" from Myrtle Groue,
Rome 6®Gescribes the writer's studies at what

 

was evidently a.theological seminary, where in
the evenings he hears lessons from two "colored
persons" tells of his preathing in the woods
and of his efforts to build a Negro church.

ii has been impossible to identify the writer,
the place, or the ~ i One letter of the

 
Cain, Patrick H, 8
collection is te a "Cousin Lizzie," who was
the wife of Dr. William M. Anderson of States-
ville. Possibly they may be the same.

Perhaps the most interesting letters are
those written from the front by Confederate
soldiers. Several are from W.G. Cain to his

 

father Patrick H. Cain, some from A.A. Anderson
to his brother Charles Anderson of-Calahala,
N.C. Two of the latter written from Chambers-
burg, Pa., June 25, 1863 and from camp near
Williamsport, Md. on dulg 5, 1863 are especial}

 
Cain, Patrick H, 9
interesting. These Civil War letters tell of

the movement of troops, of conditions in the
army, and of certain campaigns and battles,
notably lst Bull Run and Gettsyburg. Several
mention officers, Jefferson. Davis, and Lincol
as well as those ” wounded or killed.

 

A fairly large number of the letters con-
cern western migration and western lands in a
number of states from Alabama to Idahea. The
majority were written by F. Taylor Cain from
Sedalia and Florence, Missouri, to his cousin

 
Cain Patrick H, 16
Dr. John M Cain, who invested money in some
of Taylor's interprises. He describes in full
detail his efforts to make a living in real
estate, hardware and department stores, and
farming.

In this entire collection there is much

 

information on business methods and especiall
on prices of all kinds of products, goods, and
services. There are, for example, a number of
documents giving the value of slaves, their
purchase and sale prices, and, after the Civil

 
Cain, Patrick H, ll
War, the wages and tenancy of freedmen. One
rather surprising item is a letter written from
Rocky Springs, Ala., by John W. Cheshire on
Oct. 9, 1869 to his bro -in-law, Patrick
Cain, in which he speakg,only of the sale of
horses and mules but of Negroes as well.

 

The large number of legal papers are for
the most part land grants, deeds of land sales
im Anson, Davie, Eredell, Montgomery, Randolph,
and Rowan counties, land and chattel mortgages,
arrests and summonses for debts, cases before

 
k H. 12
the courts, court appointments as administra-
tors, ‘settlements of estates, petitions for
repeal of the Stock Law, etc. There are
innumerable promissory notes, mostly for very
small sums, and a large number of tax receipts
Confederate in money and kind, township,

 

county, state, and Federal coverning many years

A number of the accounts from 1889-1895
were kept in small advertising booklets, such
as Pierces Memorandum Account Book, which are
interesting in themselves.

 
Cain, Patrick H, | eh
Among the printed material are two broad-
Sides: one of April 28, 1841, a circular lette
to the citizens of the 10th Congressional
District by Jonathan Worth, later governor of
North Carolina, in answer to an attack upon
him by a Mr. Rencher; the other, Facts for the

 

 

People!Record of W.W. Holden. Holden was
appointed in 1865 by President Johnson as
Provisional Governor of N.C., and this is an
attack upon his administration. It includes
quotations from the N.C. Standard and the

 

 
Cain, Patrick H, 14
Raleigh Standard from 1850-1865. In this same
broadside is a very favorable notice of
Jonathan Worth.

(Dec. 13, 1859) concerning the transfer of a
title to some land, the “Olin property."

3 items and 1 volume added, 3-18-64. This
ledger, 1906-1925, is identified with Dr.

John M, Cain by the entry on page eighty-five
in which R. L. Cain acknowledges the settlement
of an account as the administrator of J. M.
Cain, deceased. Two receipts and a letter
found in the volume were addressed to Dr. Cain,

 

 
Cain, Patrick H. 18

 

and they are filed in an envelope attached. to
the inside of the back cover of the volume.
The 1911 note of Mrs. Ann Cook, debtor to

J. M. Cain, is entered on page thirty-six of
the accounts. Dr. Cain practiced medicine in
various parts of the county at different times
according to the North Carolina Year Book.

 

In 1906 he was at Felix. In 1908, 1912, and
1923 he was at Calahaln, and this ledger
apparently belonged primarily to his practice
there. The ledger contains Cain's accounts

with his patients.

l item added, 7-12-66: A letter to P. H.
Cain from W. G. Cain, Feb. 19, 1862. The
arrest of two soldiers charged with speculating
among the troops is mentioned. This letter
was originally found in the Jane Fisher Papers
where two letters from A. H. Cain to an
unidentified uncle can be found. However, no
relationship between the Cain and Fisher
families has been discovered.

Caldwell, John. Papers, 1857-1870. North
Carolina.

This collection consists of six letters,
only one of which is specifically addressed to
John Caldwell (July 2, 1870), a music teacher
in N.C. A letter of Aug. 30, 1860, addresses
an "Uncle John" and asks him to give music les-
sons to the writer, one 0.P. Gaddy. Other

 

letters, addressed “Dear Uncle” or "Dear
Brother" and written by members of the Gaddy
family of Arkansas, were written to a relative
in N.C., presumably John Caldwell.

 
Caldwell, John 2

Silas and Susan Gaddy wrote on Sept. 4, 1859,
giving information on crops, commodity prices,
and land prices in Drew County, Arkansas. Sim-
ilar information is contained in a letter of
May 25, 1860, from 0.P. Gaddy, who also wrote
of the great promise of wealth to be found in
Arkansas. In a letter of Aug. 30, 1860, this
writer mentioned railroad construction and relig
ious activities in Drew County as well as cli-
matic and economic conditions in the area.

E.L. Gaddy, a traveling preacher, wrote on

June 28, 1869, of his experiences as a minister

 

 
Caldwell, John =

on the Ark.-La.-Texas border. He deplored the
rough, frontier conditions and the lack of con-
cern for religious affairs. In 1869 Gaddy was a
Methodist preacher in charge of the Olive Branch
Circuit in the Little Rock Conference. His
earlier letter of July 13, 1857, from Little Reck
also concerns his itinerant preaching.

 

On July 2, 1870, Joshua Barnes wrote Caldwell
from Lumberton, N.C., to inform Caldwell that
sufficient number of prospective music students
could not be found in the Lumberton area and
that it was, therefore, inadvisable for Caldwell
to consider holding , in Lumberten.

their mutual esteem. Polk had informed Calhoun

of his determination to form an entire new cabi-
net, therebv removing the South Carolinian as. .
the Secretary of State. Polk had then offered
him the Ambassadorship to Great Britain, which

cratic party and Van Buren.

pressing the hope that he and McDuffie will dis-
continue their efforts to bring about a separate
action on the national stage by S. C., but he re
affirms his beliefs in nullification if the dif-
ferances between the North and the South become

 
Calhoun, John Caldwell, I

 

great enough to merit such action, and he goes
on to predict the fate of the Whigs should Clay
Be defeated.

Calhoun reported to Francis W. Pickens on
Mar. 1, 1845, his conference with Polk, during
which he was tendered the ministership to Great
Britain but refused it.

Calhoun, William Lowndes. Papers, 1892-1901.
Atlanta, Fulton Co., Georgia.

 

William Lowndes Calhoun (1837-1908) began
a life of distinguished public service with
his election to the Georgia legislature in
1872. He was elected mayor of Atlanta in
1879, and in 1881 he was elected judge of the

Court of Ordinary of Fulton County, being
re-elected until 1897. From 1889 to 1894 he
was president of the Confederate Veterans
Association of Fulton County, and at the
time of his death was president of the
Confederate Soldiers' Se at Atlanta. From

 
Calhoun, William Lowndes. Ps

 

1890 to 1893, he was lieutenant colonel of the
Fourth Battalion, Georgia Volunteers.

Six of the items in the collection are
military correspondence (and an order) from
John McIntosh Kell, in his capacity as adjutant
general of Georgia. (J.M. Kell, 1823-1900,
led a distinguished career as naval officer
and author. He held the position of adjutant
general, after appointment by Gov. John B.
Gordon, from 1887 until his death in 1900.)

The six letters of Kell, including one to
First Lieut. Walter E. Dean, are all written

 
Calhoun, William Lowndes. i
in 1892, and concern such battalion matters
as: a resignation, commissions, and an exam-
ination.

Two letters from Stephen D. Lee, President
of Miss. Agricultural and Mechanical College,
to Calhoun concern their mutual involvement
with Confederate Veterans. On May 11, 1901,

 

Lee refers to the planned opening of the Atlanta
Confederate Soldiers' Home (in June) of which
Calhoun was to be president.

This collection consists mainly of >usiness
letters pertaining to William Patrick Calhoun
(1851-19__), an attorney of Edgefield, S. C. and
nephew of John C. Calhoun. The letters deal
mostly with the controversy as to whether the
last Confederate Cabinet meeting was held in

Abbeville, S. C., or Washington, Ga.

Jefferson Davis and the following cabinet
members are discussed: Judah P. Benjamin, Secre-
tary of State; C. G. Memminger and G. A. Tren-
holm, Secretaries, successively, of the Treasury;

 
Calhoun, William Patrick ac 2
ohn C. Breckinridge, Secretary of War; George
Davis, Attorney Gen.; John H. Reagan, Postmaster

Gen.; and Stephen R. Mallory, Secretary of the
Navy.

Mention is made of the following members of
the President's entourage: Maj. W. F. Alexander,
Asst. to the Quartermaster Gen.; Col. M. H.

 

Clark, Chief and Confidential Clerk and Acting
Treasurer; Gen. S. W. Ferguson; Gen. J. F.
Gilmer, Chief Engineer; Gen. A. R. Lawton, Quar-
termaster Gen.; and Gen. I. M. St. John, Com-

missary Gen.

 
Calhoun, William Patrick 3
W. P. Calhoun denies that U. S. Adm. Thomas

O. Selfridge's seal is the original Confederate

Seal; and affirms that Benjamin, custodian of th

original seal, attended the last Cabinet meeting

in Abbeville, where it was decided to destroy it.
Reagan writes on July 7, 1903, that there was

no full meeting of the Cabinet after it left

 

Richmond. He remembers no formal meeting of the
remainder in Abbeville, but he does remember some
conferences with the remainder of the Cabinet in
Washington.

A letter of July 22 mentions the Confederate

 
Calhoun, William Patrick

 

treasury being (allegedly) carried southward by
the fleeing Cabinet.

Letters of Sept. 13 and Oct. 2h, 1903,
quote Jefferson Davis as having learned in Abbe-=
ville that all was lost.

Gen. E. P. Alexander, younger brother of
Maj. W. F. Alexander, writes on Oct. 2h, 1903,
that the Cabinet was officially dissolved in
Washington.

An undated memorandum states that the
authority of the Confederacy was terminated on

May 5, 1865, in 6 at a genera) confer-

 
Calhoun, William Patrick 5

 

ence (not a formal Cabinet meeting) of Davis, a
few Cabinet members, and Gens. Lawton and St.
John. An order, signed by Maj. W. F. Alexander,
was made to feed troops then passing through Ga,
This order, states the Maj., was the last offi-
cial order of the Confederate States. Col. I.
W. Avery says likewise in his history of Ga.

that Mrs. Varina (Howell) Davis is quoted as
having written on Jan. 26, 1900, to Mrs. Willa-
metta (Andrews) Green that the last Cabinet
meeting was held in Washington, and that the Con

federacy was dissolved there.

 
Calhoun, William Patrick 6
Other persons mentioned in the collection
include Armistead Burt, former U. S. Representa-
tive from S. C.; D. L. Yulee, C. S. A. Represen-
tative from Fla.; and Gens. Braxton Bragg and

Robert Toombs.

1 item added, 1-8-71: A letter to Calhoun

 

from W. T. Walker (July 17, 1912) concerning
the gubernatorial election in South Carolina.
Walker commented on the candidates, Ira Boyd

1859 - written by Lorin Blodget, Thomas B, Lin-

Blodget) with reference to a plan for recovering
real estate in Washington, D. C., formerly owned
by Samuel Blodget (1757-1814), noted Washington
architect and land speculator; numerous bills
and regeipts; and legal documents. The col-
lection is strongest r years 1838-1883.

 
Calvin, Samuel 4
There are about 15 Letters in the collection

written by Samuel Calvin.

For the years before 1846 the collection
consists largely of letters to Calvin from per-
sons desiring legal aid in the collection of
debts. In addition, there is an interesting

 

thirteen-page letter by William Smith, written
from Philadelphia on Oct. 22, 1793, regarding
the cholera epidemic in that city. Also, legal
documents are abundant. These include inden-
tures; wills; accounts of settlements of estates
a commission of a \ (1803); powers of

 
Calvin, Samuel 5
attorney; articles of agreement (business con-
tracts); a paper of apprenticeship (1839);
citizenship papers (1838, 1840); mortgages;
court dockets (Courts of Common Pleas of Hunt-
ingdon and Blair Gounties); written statements
of witnesses in civil and criminal cases; print

 

ed copies of the record in certain cases argued
by Calvin, Such legal documents will be found
throughout the collection. Other items are: a
plan of Hollidaysburg, Pa. (1840); bills and
receipts (foodstuffs, fabrics, hardware, medi-
cines, and drugs); a eS of the constitution

 
Calvin, Samuel 6
of the Old Warrior and Clay Club of Hollidays-
burg (1844)> with 148 signatures and the minutes
of the meetings, Mar. 23-Aug. 31, 1844; a map
a Phe as drawn by the U. S. War Department

1844); a copy of the Williamsport Lycoming
Free Press (July 9, 1836).

 

 

For the period 1846-1851 the correspondence
bears upon details of Calvin's election to Con-
gress in 1848, matters of patronage and other
services to his constituents once he entered
into office (application for post-office posi-
tions and military ~~ i especially), Calving

 
Calvin, Samuel 7
decision not to be a candidate in 1850, and >
politics in Blair Co., Pa., in particular.

With reference to Blair Co., a series of letters
dated Jan.-Feb., 1846, concern measures taken
by James Martin Bell, John Fenlon, James Cooper,
and others to assure the passage through the

 

state Senate of a bill forming Blair Co. out of
parts of Bedford and Huntingdon counties. Let-
ters to Calvin by George Taylor, W. Williams,
Thomas MCNamara, and John Penn Jones, editor of
the Hollidaysburg Register, contain additional
references to politics in Blair Co. during

 
Calvin, Samuel
successive years,

Some reference is made in the letters to
national problems and politics. Letters to
Calvin suggest (Nov. 11, 1848) Josiah Randall
of Philadelphia as an excellent man for a posi-
tion in President Taylor's cabinet, and advise

 

(Dec, 14, 1848) the election of James K. Moor-
head as state senator. Several letters to Cal-
vin for 1850-51 contain references to the tariff,
and generally advise increased duties on iron
and coal (cf. letters of June 10 and 15, 1850;
Jan. 6 and 12, Feb. yr) 5, 1851). A long

 
 

Calvin 1 9
Letter oo wy il, 1850, concerns the Compromise

of 1850, the writer predicting that if the com-
promise failed and California were admitted to
the union regardless of this fact, the result
would be "disunion and civil war." A letter
from Iowa (Mar. 2, 1860) states that people

there were much in favor of the Kansas-Nebraska
Bill and Stephen A. Douglas, and that slavery,
not the tariff, was the primary political issue
in Iowa. Calvin voiced his stand regarding
slavery and its extension into the territories
in a letter of Oct, @e. he was, he wrote,

 
 

Calvin uel 10
Opposed oO slavery as an institution in general,

and to the Missouri Compromise in particular.
Miscellaneous items of this type include: notes
of lectures (1850) and drafts and printed copies
(1860) of speeches given by Calvin on the sub-
ject of the tariff; copies of supplements of

the Hollidaysburg Register (June 16 & Oct, 1,
1880) containing articles written by Calvin on
the currency question.

Numerous references (1859-1860, 1867) in
the letters to Calvin's particthpation in state
politics and “oo 1851 show that he

 
Calvin, Samuel 11
remained influential in Pa. There 1s no indi-
cation, however, of his role in the state con-
stitutional convention of 1872-73, Nor does
the Crvil War receive mention. There is a
muster roll of the 2nd Regt., Pa. Vols. (1847),
stationed in Mexico. A letter of Oct. 30, 1867,

 

speaks enthusiastically of the potential develop
ment of Washington, D. C., after the Civil War
as a commercial and industrial center.

Noticeable are Calvin's business activities
after 1850. He invested money ina great varie
ty of new enterprises: the Patton's Ville &

 
 

Calvin uel 12
Woodberry Pirnpike Hoad Co. (1854); Morrison's

Cove Turnpike Road Co. (1852); Hollidaysburg &
Bedford Plank Road Co. (1853); Hollidaysburg &
Altoona Plank Road Co. (1854); Juniata Steam

Boat Co. (1864); Hollidaysburg Gas Co. (1856);
Hollidaysburg and Bennington Railroad & Mining

Co, The collection contains two mortgages
(1864) of this last company, as well as Calvin's
shares in most of the others. Calvin also owned
land in Blair Co. near Little Juniata Mountain,
which he leased to mining companies during 1860
1870, There are two r lists of Calvin's

 
Calvin, Samuel 13
Tand holdings in Pa. In 1856 he purchased lands
in Hardin and Muscatine counties, Iowa. He sold
these properties in 1866-67, evidently for a
large profit. Calvin was interested in mining
primarily, and therefore in lands containing
mineral deposits.

 

A series of letters (Oct., 1881-Dec., 1883)
concern the Rico Reduction and Mining Co.
Samuel Calvin was vice-president of it. Letters
from Rico, Colo., report on the wealth of sil-
ver, salt, and sulphur deposits in that area;
describe the a for the mining and

 
Calvin, Samuel 14
smelting of silver; discuss expenses and profits
labor problems, incidents of life in the mining
camp, legal troubles with claims. Miscellaneous
pieces are: maps showing the location of the
Rico Company claim, called the "Big Juniate!"
(Oct, 21-22, 1881); a deed to the mine (Oct. 23,

 

1881); a copy of the charter and by-laws of the
company (1883); photos of the mine. The col-
lection contains Calvin's income and special tax
receipts for the years 1863-71. James Calvin,
Samuel Calvin's cousin, was the owner of a
forge in Lancaster, Pa, (cf. letter of Dec. 16,

 
Calvin. gamnel 15
1800).

Miscellaneous items include: single copies
of various newspapers - the Ebensburg Mountain
Sentinel (Apr. 11, 1850), the Bedford Jackson
Democrat (May 3, 1850), the Radical and Whi
(Feb. 15, 1868); a printed circular (1850) to

 

the farmers of Pa. announcing the formation of
a State Agricultural Society; a printed election
circular of the Independent Greenback Party ad-
vocating Peter Cooper and Samuel F. Cary for
president and vice-president, respectively
(1876, 6 pp.); a wa to the Keystone

Note: material on John Dougherty, Juniata
Valley canal man and innkeeper, appears in
letters of 1839 and 1851, in accounts of
debts, and in a small notebook listing his
personal property in 186, when he was
evidently in financial trouble. His inn
property seems to have been sold by Edward

Cambreleng, Churchill Caldom. Papers, 1835.
Huntington, Suffolk Co., N.Y.

 

This is a private letter of William C. Rives
to New York Congressman Churchill C. Cambreleng.
It concerns President Andrew Jackson's annual
message to Congress, delivered Dec., 1834. In
this address Jackson had dealt in a belligerent
manner with the issue of the unpaid money pay-
ments previously agreed upon by the French
Government (the French Claims Controversy).
Rives expresses his approval of the tone of
Jackson's message, although he considers the
recommendations to “oe property as

 
Cambreleng, Churchill Caldom

 

inexpedient. Cambreleng, as Chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, is advised
by Rives to respond to the spirit of the
President's message, yet without offending
French pride.

Rives supports Cambreleng's elevation to
the committee chairmanship and comments on the

reasons why John M. Patton, a member of the
Committee was opposed. Rives also comments
unfavorably on a report of Senator Henry
Clay on the French Claims Controversy.

(General Butler's Department) are from the lines
around Richmond at Dutch Gap and Bermuda Hun-
dred, May, 1864, to Feb., 1865. They are genera

in character, mentioning picket skirmishing and
Confederate desertions. The second group came
from Kate's cousin, Diedrich F,. Camenga, who
presumably was working for the U. S. Sanitary
Commission. He had been wounded and was at the

U. S. Army General Hospital at Point Lookout,
Maryland, His letters give general mention of
food, Negro soldiers, weather, nuns as nurses,
and the final demobilization of the hospital.
Of note is his letter of April 30, 1865, in
which he describes the search for John Wilkes
Booth in the county around the hospital by
Convalescents and doctors.

Three other letters from New York soldiers
are included. With little connection to the
main papers, they could have been to other
members of Kate Camenga's family.

George, Eighth Duke of Argyll (1823-1900),
British statesman, was secretary of state for
India, 1868 -1874. During this period on June
10, 1870, John Romilly resigned from the commis-
sion drafting a code of laws for India and dis-
missed the government of India's opposition to
the code.

Sir John Nicholl Robert Campbell (1799-1870),
army officer and diplomat in the service of the
East India Company, was the son of Sir Robert
Campbell, a chairman and one of the directors of
the company. In 1828 Sir John married Grace
Elizabeth Bainbridge, daughter of Thomas Bain-

1823 and a Knight Commander of the Order of the
Guelphs in 1836. His only son and heir was Sir
Gilbert Edward Campbell of Carrick Buoy.

Sir Robert Campbell (1771-1858 ) married

Sir John places his employment in Persia as
early as 1819 (letter of July 30, 1830). During
the term of Sir John Macdonald Kinneir as envoy
to Persia, 1824-1830, Campbell serves as his

second assistant (enclosure with letter of Aug.
20, 1829). Just before Macdonald's death Sir
Henry Willock, first assistant and former chargé
d'affaires, is removed from office, and Campbell
then succeeds as envoy. In 1835 Sir Henry Ellis

Campbell's career in Persia is complicated
by the divided authority that he serves. He is
officially the envoy of the Supreme Government
in India and is appointed by the governor gene-
ral in council. India pays the expenses of the
mission in Persia. Ultimate authority, however,

is in London at the India House, headquarters of
the East India Company. Campbell has access to
‘the India House through his father. In addition
the -envoy must adhere to the foreign policy of
the British government. Although the interests

 
 

and pottele Ss of these several institutions ge-
nerally coincide, their officials may cdiffer
about what is the proper implementation of poli-
cy by a diplomat in a distant country. The com-
plexity of these relationships is illustrated in
this collection during the controversies sur-
rounding Campbell's appointment and later re-

placement by Ellis. These problems are also ap-
parent in the question of whether the mission

should be accredited to the crown or to the come
pany. From 1824 to 1835 the East India Company
has charge of the mission in Persia. Before and

 
 

this responsibility.

Diplomatic relations with Persia also receive
considerable attention in these papers. The
successive terms of Sir Henry Willock, Sir John
Macdonald Kinneir, Sir John Campbell, Sir Henry
Ellis, and Sir John McNeill are represented.

While Macdonald and Campbell are at Tehran, re-
lations with the Persian government are good,
and British military officers participate in the
command and training of the armies of the Shah
and of Abbas Mirza, the heir apparent. This
favored position deteriorates by the time

 
 

Campbell leaves, and relations are broken off
temporarily during McNeill's residency. The
British envoys are concerned with encouraging a
stable Persian government that can withstand
Russia. Russian expansion west of the Caspian
Sea is one of Campbell's concerns. A more imme-
diate problem is the maintenance of English in-

fluence in Tehran, and Campbell works to prevent
Russian officers from supplanting the British as
military assistants to the Persian army. The
English consider Persia a buffer state between
Russia and India,

Some of the same problems that are illustra-

 
 

ted — this collection oe aise found in the
career of Sir Harford Jones (later Brydges) as
British resident at Baghdad, Turkey. Jones also
had access to the India House through James
Willis, a friend there. See the James Willis
Papers, 1799-1804. The Francis Rawdon Chesney
Papers have a long analysis (104 pp.) of Persia

and British-Persian relations that dates ca.
1831-1833.

In 1823-1824 the British government transfers
the responsibility for diplomatic relations with
Persia from London to the Supreme Government in

 
 

e1 20
India, At this time Sir Henry Willock is charge
d'affaires at Tehran. The Persian government
sternly resists this change, and in April, 1824,
Willock reports in detail his conversations with
Persian officials since late 1823. His letters
are addressed to George Canning, Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, and to Francis Natha
iel Conyngham, Under Secretary. In 1824 the In-

dian authorities appoint Sir John Macdonald Kin-
neir as envoy to Persia (he is generally ad-
dressed as Macdonald in these papers). On May
14, 1824, George Swinton, Chief Secretary, Poli

 
holl Robert,
ical Separtacat. Supreme Government of India,
advises Macdonald of the Persian refusal to ac-
cept a mission from the East India Company, and
he tells the envoy to halt his journey at Bombay
pending further orders. Ina long letter Mac-
donald analyzes the relations of Persia with
London and India, He argues that the Indian
authorities are the proper ones for dealing with
Persia, an especially important matter now be-
cause of Russian designs on that country (June
17). On Dec, 11 Macdonald notes that Prince
Abbas Mirza will accept the new mission, and he

 

 
 

12
contends that the time is right for the company
to press its case and to restore its prestige.
Because of the Russian threat, Persia and Britah
need their alliance, The Shah does finally ac-
cept the new arrangements,

The problem of the status of the company's
envoys appears in the correspondence of 1827-

1829. In 1828 Sir John Campbell notes the les-
sened prestige of the mission when he summarizes
events since Macdonald's arrival in Persia (12
pp.). Campbell also lists and discusses various
expenditures that have been incurred by the

 
 

envoy (19 pp., ca. 1827 On Set. 31, 1829,
Campbell cites reasons for believing that Mac-
donald is accredited by the crown, though still
the company's envoy. Sir John encloses a letter
from Lady Macdonald in which she reports ques-
tions that were raised in the Russian capital
about her husband's diplomatic status. On Feb,

8, 1828, Campbell writes from St. Petersburg
about his talks with Russian officials. The
subject of these conversations are negotiations
to end the Russo-Persian War and Macdonald's as-
sistance with them at the request of Russian

 
 

On Nov. 27, 1829
Sir John. reports to Lord Ellenborough, President
of the Board of Control, about the bad state of
Persia after the war, Macdonald's efforts to pre
vent a Persian attack on Turkey, and Russian at-
tempts to draw the Shah into a military expedi-
tion against the region east of the Caspian Sea.

In several letters of August and September, 1829
he discusses the bad opinion that he and Macdon-
ald have of Sir Henry Willock, who is the first
assistant in the mission. Macdonald wants to
retire in 1831 if someone other than Willock wil

 
 

succeed him as envoy.
The correspondence for 1830 is extensive, but
a large part of it concerns the struggle between
Willock and Campbell to succeed Macdonald. The
envoy is seriously ill during the winter and
spring and dies in June, but before his death
he has Willock removed from office. Macdonald
also advises that the mission needs only one ase
sistant, and the Indian government complies.
The attempt to oust Willock is complicated by
the fact that he has influential friends in In-
dia, notably George Swinton. Campbell assumes

 
Campbell, Sir John Nicholl Robert, 16

charge of the mission and is eventually con-
firmed as envoy, but Willock stays in Persia un-
til after this news arrives. Willock's brother,
George, is also involved. Authority for appoin
ment of the envoy rests with the governor general
in council. When Governor General Lord William
Cavendish Bentinck reports to the India House
his appointment of Campbell, he states his deci-
sion in terms that displease his superiors. The
authorities at the India House draw up an in-
struction for the governor general concerning
his responsibilities in appointing the Persian

 

 
 

envoy. Sir Robert Campbell reports in precise
detail on the procedure for drafting this in-
struction, and he sends copies of the several
drafts as they are approved and altered by the
various officials and committees at the India
House (July 21, 1831; Oct. 24, Sept. 10, and
Dec. 15, 1832). These papers " provide detailed -

information about the procedure in drafting,
altering, and approving dispatches at the India
House.

Campbell succeeds as envoy, and Sir John Mc-
Neill becomes his assistant. McNeill, a surgeon

 
 

of the Bengal establishment, has served in Per-
sia since 1824. In 1836 he becomes envoy and
minister plenipotentiary to Persia. At the same
time as Macdonald's death, the British also lose
Major Hart, the experienced and influential com-
mandant of their troops in Persia. The English
commandant is responsible for military advice

and assistance to the Shah and to Prince Abbas
Mirza, and Hart has commanded the Prince's army.
Sir John laments the losses of Macdonald and
Hart whose services he praises. He appoints
Benjamin B. Shee, Hart's adjutant, as his tem-

 
Campbe Nicholl Robert, 19

 

porary successor, but he does not think him
suitable for permanent commandant (Shee is ap-
pointed commander of the British detachment in
1836). Sir John fears Russian designs to re-
place Hart and his officers with their military
personnel, and he assures Abbas Mirza that the
British will help drill his troops (June 24,

Nov. 30, 1830). He has problems about the ex-
tent to which the British troops will aid the
Persians in the field and about how much the
Shah should contribute to their payment (see
letters of March 12, June 30, July 16, 30, Oct.

 
20

 

ee Nov. 27, 30, and ochers - At this time
the Prince is engaged in defending his claim to
the throne and is assembling his badly equipped
troops (Sept. 8, Nov. 4, 8, 27).

Late in 1830 Sir John is not yet confirmed
as envoy, and he notes the embarrassment caused
him by this delay and by his lack of royal cre-

dentials (Oct. 3, enclosed with letter of Oct.
30; Sept. 5; and two letters of Dec. 29). Both
Governor General Bentinck and Sir John Malcolm,
Governor of Bombay, believe that the crown sho
appoint the envoy to Persia (enclosure with

 
Campbell, Sir John Nicholl Robert, a1.
letter of Dec. 29, Bentinck to Malcolm). Ata

time when Russia poses a threat to Persia, it

is important, argues Bentinck, that the envoy be
known to act under royal orders. On July 21
Campbell remarks that the Persians usually ig-
nore the connection between the mission and the
East India Company. He observes also that cases

 

of emergency will occasionally necessitate the
envoy to exercise his own judgment and thereby
to place himself between the company's orders
and the wishes of the Persian government (July
30). Sir John recognizes the danger of Russian

 
 

subversion of Persia, but he considers chimeri-
cal any idea that Russia would invade India (le
ter of Nov. 4, addressed to Sir Robert Gordon,
envoy at Constantinople). Turkish-Persian re-
lations, despite a common problem with Russia,
are not always amicable, and Robert Taylor, Eng-
lish diplomat at Baghdad, reports a quarrel over

treatment of Persians within the pashalik. Tay-
lor insists that British policy should prevent
the Turks and Persians from encroaching upon
each other, for any territory taken by Persia
would be future gain for Russia (Oct. 12).

 
Campbell, Sir John Nicholl Robert, 23

 

Letters for 1831 are few but good. On Feb.
27 Campbell reports on the strength of Abbas
Mirza's political position. At this time the
Prince is involved with a military expedition
against Khorasan, and the relation of the Bri-
tish military detachment to this campaign is a
delicate question. The English government has
ordered strict neutrality, and Sir John does

not allow the troops to engage in actual hos-
tilities. However, he insists that the power
of Abbas Mirza must be upheld in Persia. Sup-
port of the. Prince and opposition to Russian

 
Campbell, Sir John Nicholl Robert.
influence in Persia are firm British policies.
For a time Campbell is concerned about a possible
alliance of Russia and Persia against Khorasan
and Khiva. The Prince's assault against them
destroys the Moslem coalition that was formed
during recent warfare (Feb. 27 and enclosure;
March 16). Despite the rumors of Russo-Persian
cohesion, Sir John believes that the Shah and
Prince have no intention of injuring the alli-
ance with England (Aug. 30). In late 1830 Ab-
bas Mirza explains his proposed campaign against
Khorasan that later results in a Persian triumph

 

 

 
 

Among the papers for 1832 and 1833 is a sum-
mary of Campbell's problems since becoming en-
voy (enclosure No. 10 with letter of Sept. 10,
1832; another document on the same subject is
dated 1835). Shortly after Macdonald's death
Campbell had to resist an attempt by the Prince

to assume command of the British troops. Cer-
tain agreements were made before the troops were
allowed to accompany the Prince on an expedition
against one of his rivals. In 1832 Benjamin
Shee, successor to Hart as commander of the Bri-

 
 

promises him a loan. Shee views this action as
necessary to fend off Russian aid (Jan. 31, Feb.
1, 1832). This unauthorized engagement, embaras~
ses Campbell who has to repudiate it (enclosure
No. 10 with letter of Sept. 10, 1832; Feb. 27,
1832). A long document of Feb. 3, 1832, (36 pn)

is an account by Borowski who is associ-
ated closely with Benjamin Shee and the British
detachment in Khorasan. This account reports
about Abbas Mirza's campaign there, Shee's ne-
gotiations with the Prince that Campbell later

 
27
repudiates, and the events in Khorasan from Dec.
3, 1831, to Feb. 3, 1832. Attached are copies
of letters from Meerza Baba, physician to the
Shah who also happens to be in British pay. Cam
bell describes his connection with Borowski and
Meerza Baba in Memorandum No. 8 (1835). Borow-
ski is noted in Sir Percy Sykes, A History of
Persia, as a Polish officer named Berovski tol.
II, p. 325). Borowski's account notes a Russian
reference to him as a Polish rebel. On May 15
Sir Robert Campbell reminds his son to report
fully to the Indian government, especially about

 

 
 

pecuniary matters, and that he should report on
political events to the Secret Committee at the
India House. Sir Robert also gives his reaction
to the Reform Bill and to the ministerial chang-
es that precede its passage. On June 8, 1833,
however, he advises Sir John to have as little
as possible to do with the Secret Committee. At

present it is composed of the chairman, deputy
chairman, and the senior member of the court,
and the first two consider the Persian mission
useless, On October 11 he advises his son that
a special embassy may be sent to Persia from

London.

 
 

various charges are brought against
Sir John's official conduct. These complaints
originate in Persia and the antagonists include
the Shah's minister of foreign affairs. Sir
Robert wields his influence and corresponds with
a number of high officials in London. Their re-
sponse is favorable, and Sir John appears exon-
erated. However, he loses his post in Persia

when Sir Henry Ellis is sent there with a royal
embassy in 1835. The correspondence of the
Campbells in 1834-1835 is primarily concerned
with these problems. A miscellaneous item is

 
 

from William Eliot, an Engli
reports on his tracing of the route of the famous
Retreat of the Ten Thousand in 401-400 B. C. He
also claims to be the discoverer of the Euphrates
route, a feat attributed to Francis Rawdon Ches-
ney (Dec. 16, 1834):

Three memoranda of 1835 (numbered 3, 5, and

8) are detailed reports on Persia. They are
unsigned, but Campbell is probably the author,
Two memoranda are addressed to Sir Henry Ellis,
and the third probably is also. In Memorandum
No. 3 (2 pp.) the writer summarizes Russian in-

 
 

tentions and actions toward the territory east
of the Caspian Sea. He thinks that Russia will
eventually conquer it, but natural obstacles and
the defence of the Uzbeks will make the task dif
ficult. The same subject is also included in
Memorandum No. 5 (14% pp.) in which the writer
analyzes military and political conditions in

Persia and its relations with Russia and Bri-
tain, He regards Afghanistan as a potential
buffer state for India but considers Persia pre-
ferable. Persia, contends the author, cannot
ultimately be kept independent of Russia; there-

 
32
fore, Britain should strengthen her position in
southern Persia and in the Persian Gulf. Memo-
randum No. 8 is a list with comments about per-
sons in Persia who are in the employ of the Bri-
tish secret service. The writer stresses the
importance of keeping some member of the mis-
sion's staff at Tabriz because of its strategic

 

importance, In the summer of 1835 Campbell
sends W. H. Wyburd, a lieutenant of the Indian
navy, to Khorasan, Khiva, and other territory
east of the Caspian Sea. Information about this
region is limited, and Russian expansion is on

 
33
its frontiers. A copy of Campbell's instructio
to Wyburd is dated June 8, 1835. In Sir John's
letter of June 18 and those attached to it he
explains Wyburd's..task and his qualifications
for the trip.

B, D. W. Macdonald of the Bengal cavalry is
the author of a long memorandum (64 pp.) that
is dated in 1835. He records the events in
Persia from the death of Fath Ali Shah in 1834
until February, 1835, after the accession to the
throne of Mohammed Shah, Macdonald mentions in
his conclusion that he was in Tehran in January,

 

 
Nicholl Robert, 34
1835, so he must have observed some, if not mos
of the events that he describes. Campbell and
the Russian envoy assist Mohammed Shah, and Sir
Henry Bethune commands troops on the march to
Tehran. Macdonald may well have participated in
these military operations. He gives a detailed
account of the political developments and of the

 

military campaign that culminate in the Shah's
triumphal entry into Tehran and the establish-
ment of his government. Macdonald reports the
Russian and British efforts in the Shah's be-
half, and he especially praises Campbell's work,

 
 

There are twenty-six letters from Francis
Farrant to Sir John Campbell, May 4, 1835-Aug.
4, 1838. They comprise most of the items after
1835. Farrant is a lieutenant in the Third Bom-
bay Light Cavalry and is promoted to major in
1837 (Asiatic Review, New Series, Vol. XXIII,
Part 2, p. 329). On Dec. 12, 1837, Farrant

writes that he has been appointed second in com-
mand of the British detachment in Persia. In
1835 his duty is the training of cavalry for the
Shah. Farrant's letters are full of comment
about his military duties, British civil and

 
military officials, the Persian rulers and minis-
ters, and the political and military situation
in Persia. His comments about Sir Henry Ellis
are generally uncomplimentary. Farrant records
the strained relations between Britain and Per-
sia after 1835, and in 1837-1838 he reports on
the Shah's expedition against Herat, Afghanista
In the spring of 1838 he is in the Shah's camp
before Herat.

For November, 1838, there is a review and
criticism of British-Persian relations by Sir
Henry Willock (8 pp.). This copy has marginal

 

 
 

A series of letters to Campbell from British
agents in the Persian Gulf dates from 1827 to
1835, mostly 1832-1835. The principal correspo
dents are D, A. Blane, Resident at Bushire, and
Capt. S. Hennell of the Bushire residency (dates
may be found on the autograph cards). A few

letters are from E. Stanners (1827), Resident in
the Persian Gulf, and T, Mackenzie, unidentified
These officials report news from southern Persia
and the Persian Gulf where their posts are on
the route of communication between Europe and

* Samuel Hennell

 
 

portation problems and Francis Chesney's pro-
posals on the route via Baghdad (as in June,
1834). Hennell’ visits the island of Karak nort
west of Bushire, and he reports in detail about
its present condition and its potential for a
military base (letter of May 19, 1831, addressed

to Charles Norris, Chief Secretary to the Bombay
Government). The British occupy Karak several
years later. A number of letters are addressed
from Blane and Hennell to Norris.

There are several letters of 1830-1835 betwen

 
 

Campbell and James Brant, Vice Consul at Trebi-
zond onithe Turkish coast of the Black Sea,
Brant is interested in drawing Persian trade
through this port. On Nov. 5, 1830, Campbell
analyzes the commercial potential of various pro
ducts. On June 25, 1835, Brant notes obstacles
to Chesney's plan to navigate the Euphrates.

In 1838 Britain and Persia break off diplo-
matic relations, The Shah sends an emissary,
Hussein Khan, to London in order to remonstrate
against the position taken by Sir John McNeill,
English envoy at Tehran. Khan has conversations

 
 

with Lord Palmerston, Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs. A document of 1839 (173 pp.),
"Part 2nd Continuation of Hussein Khan's State-
ment," records details of these negotiations
with Palmerston. Khan lists the points in Pal-
merston's position and replies to them. Inclu-
ded are the nine demands that the foreign secre-

tary formally presents the Persians and Khan's
remarks about them. Diplomatic relations are
resumed in 1841 when McNeill returns to his pos
On Nov. 20, 1841, William Joseph Eastwick,
later a member of the Council of -+ndia, discus-

 
 

ses the personal problems of Charles Masson, au-
thor of various works on Afghanistan and its
antiquities. Eastwick sends Campbell a copy of
Ariana Antidua, An Account of the Antiques and
Coins of Afghanistan (1841) by Horace H. Wilson.
This book has an introduction by Masson.

A useful volume about Persia is Sir Percy

Sykes, A History of Persia (London, 1930), Vol.
II. Information about the lesser diplomatic of-
ficials and the military officers is scarce.
Sykes mentions some of them, The Asiatic Journs
reports promotions and movements of officials in

 
 

India and its service p poe pn oF Persia,
Farrant and others are listed, for example, in
1837 (Vol. XXIII, Part 2, p. 329). The Journal
also has contemporary news accounts about Persia
and the Persian Gulf. Asian news generally ap-
pears in Part II of each volume.

Several documents in Persian are filed at the

end of the collection»& in Picture Cab.II-Dr.1.
There are translations of several communica-
tions from the Persian rulers and the foreign
minister. The letters of June, 1830, relate to
Macdonald's death, and a decree from Mohammed

An exception, however, is a letter of 1824

to Robert Campbell. The twenty-four directors
of the East India Company annually approve a
list, the House List, of persons whom they
recommend as new directors. The proprietors of
the company then elect the directors. Between

1784 and 1824 no attempts were successful in
electing persons other than the nominees of the
directors. (Cs H. Philips, East India Company,
1784-1824, p. 4). On April 2, 1824, a Dr.
Macqueen, one of the proprietors, complains
about the procedure of electing directors, and
also states that Douglas Kinnaird and others

in the Court of Proprietors may oppose the
House List in the near future. Dr. Macqueen is
apparently Malcolm Macqueen, who is listed
among licentiates of the Royal College of
Physicians (The British Imperial Calendar for
the Year of Our Lord 1522, p. 267).

A letter from James Brant, British vice con-
sul at Trebizond, Turkey, to Lord Palmerston,
is dated May 21, 1831. Brant discusses tariff
discrimination against British trade to Persia
via Turkey, attempts to rectify this situation,
and the advantages of trade by this route.

On June 16, 1831, Syr John Campbell writes
to Sir John Malcolm. Campbell discusses his
hope that nothing will be done to discourage
steam navigation between India md Fngland, the
necessity of future non-involvement of the
Bushire residency in south Persian politics,

 
Campbell, Sir John Nicholl Robert 49
and the activities of Prince Abbas Mirza in
southern Persia. Another document contains
scattered extracts from Campbell's journal from
April 7, 1831, to October 11, 1833. These
extracts refer to the Prince's plans for a
campaign against Herat, Afghanistan.

On December 4, 1833, Lord Palmerston, Foreig
Secretary, writes to James Baillie Fraser,
author and traveller. Baillie is to carry
dispatches to Persia, and Palmerston details
instructions about the information that he
wants Fraser to acquire about Persia, Baghdad,
and Russo-Persian relations.

 

 
Campbell, Sir John Nicholl Hobert 50
Another document (ca. 1834; 18 pp.) is a
copy of the charges that Mirza Abul Hassan Khan,

Persian foreign minister, has made against Sir
John Campbell. These charges were sent to

Lord Palmerston. A manuscript of 1835 is the
appendix to Sir John's refutation of Hassan
Khan's charges. It contains extracts from Camp-

 

bell's journal (May 17, 1833-June 26, 1834),
extracts from letters of Sir John Macdonald
Kinneir to George Swinton and to Lord William
Bentinck (1827-1829), an extract from a minute
of Bentinck (1829), and a copy of a letter from
the Kaim Mukaum to Robert Campbell (n. d.).

Henry Willock's removal is noted in these ex-
‘tracts.

On February 26, 1835, Sir Henry Ellis writes
to Sir John about the transfer of the mission
from the company to the crown, the appointment
of Ellis and McNeill, Campbell's work in Persia,
and Ellis's plans to assume control of the mis-
sion.

Several documents of 1838-1839 are critical
of British policy toward Persia and Afghanistan.
Sir Henry Willock writes to Lord Palmerston and
argues for the conciliation of Persia and the

 

 
Campbell, Sir John Nicholl Robert ba

 

abandonment of interference with the present
regime in Afghanistan (Dec. 1. 18383 Feb. 11,
1839). He also discusses Russian policy toward
central Asia. An unsigned document of August
3, 1839, has a severe denunciation of the Bri-
tish position in the diplomatic quarrel with
Persia. The writer has examined the statements

of Hussein Khan, Persian envoy recently in
England, and of Lord Palmerston.

Campbell was apparently a merchant and busi-
ness man of Philadelphia. The first item is a
partnership agreement by which Campbell was to
furnish the capital and buy the goods for Joseph
P. Brown and John M. Shirley who were to operate

a store in Russellville, Kentucky. The other
item concerns debts of the firm of I. and F.
Gorin and requests Campbell to make the best
possible arrangements with the creditors,

On Feb. 3, 1944, twenty-one items were add-

 
Campbell, Thomas -2=

ed to this collection. Included are several
letters bearing on the séttlement of the indebt-
edness of the Gorin firm. These papers also
introduce the firm of John Gill, Jr., & Co.
which was one of the creditors of the Gorin
firm. Most of the papers bear on the former
company and concern the collection of debts,

 

the purchase and shipment of supplies (esp.
tobacco; see letter of Feb.18, 1822), end re-
quests for various errands to be done or pur-
chases to be made for friends of the owners.

Thomas Campbell (1777-1844) was a noted
British poet.

Campbell's letter of Aug. 28, 1825, to
Guglielmo Pepe, Italian patriot and general,

concerned: their friendship and joy that the
news of Pepe's death was untrue; difficulty
with Campbell's son Thomas; the effort to
establish the University of London; and happi-
ness at Pisa's liberation. Another letter to

Pepe dates sometime during 1822-1829 when
Campbell was living at No. 10 Upper Seymour St.
from where the letter was addressed. Campbell
advises Pepe about suitable places near London
for his summer residence.

Campbell's letter of ca. 1838 is about dinner
and social arrangements with several relatives.

The letter is undated, but reference to his
address at Lincoln's Inn Fields dates it during
1837-1841. A nephew was newly married early in
1838, and reference in the letter to a nephew

 
Campbell, Thomas (1777-1844) 3

 

and his bride indicates that the letter dates
ca. 1838.

Campbell was visiting R. Arkwright at Stoke
near Bakewell, Derbyshire, when he requested
that a copy of the last edition of his poems be
sent there. The letter is dated only Oct. 6.
Campbell's host was Robert Arkwright who was
listed for Stoke Hall in Paterson's Roads

It is impossible to do justice to tle value of

David Campbell's aa ) a brief survey. He

 

 
/Campbell Family 10
was an observant man, who, when away from home,
as he frequently was, wrote long accounts of
the people and country which he saw.

David Campbell wrote many letters to his wife
and brothers when serving in the War of 1812,
and in the Virginia Assembly, when on trips to
Baltimore and Tenn,, and during the first year
of his term as governor. During 1822-23 Camp-
bell's letters contained many references to
Winfield Scott and Thomas Mann Randolph. Begin-
ning about 1830 and continuing almost to his
death, he wrote regularly to his nieces
especially Virginia “eo Jane Campbell and

 

 
Campbell Family __ an
to his nephew, William Bowen Campbell, In these
letters he revealed interest in political events,
interest in the bank and sub-treasury of the
Jackson-Van Buren era, disapproval of abolition-
ists, Southern demagogues and nullification,
disapproval of emotion in religion, concern for
the plight of the free Negro, interest in histor

 

 

ical works and in literature, and an interest in
government lands and bounty lands as well as
many other problems of the period in which he
lived. David Campbell was an omnivorous reader
and often gave virtual reviews of his readings

 
CAMPBELL, FAMILY Sketch [12]
When writing to his brothers, nieces, and nephews
He was a philosopher and a practical business
man; his interpretations of contemporary events
were often uncanny in their accuracy.

In addition to Governor David Campbell's reg-
ular correspondence with members of his family
his correspondence includes many letters from

 

prominent people in the United States. Among
such letters are; (1) Several from Andrew Jack-
son who was on one or two occasions, a visitor
in Campbell's home; (2) Many
letters from members of Congress who reported

political news to or some of whom

recived extensive aid from David Campbell in

uncovering material for his work on King's
Mountain, VYampbell not only used his own family
Papers but made inquiries and secured papers
from people to whom Draper did not have access.
Campbell also helped J.G.M. Ramsey some and

received two or three letters from William Henr
Foote requesting information for his sketches
of Virginia or North C,rolina. Campbell usuall
kept notes on points which he worked out for
these historians, In fact,his papers include
much material on the ee of King's Mountai

 
- CAMPBELL | FAMTLY ___ Sketch [15]

In addition to his notes on King's Mountain,
Governor Campbell, realizing that much inform-
ation concerning the period of his early life
might be lost, investigated the history of the
Methodist Church in the vicinity of Abingdon,
wrote sketches of the early history of Abingdon,
and accounts of early ministers and early school
teachers of the area as well as accounts of his
own career. Campbell began saving letters and
papers, which he considered valuable for poster-
ity, by the time he was fifteen years of age.

David Campbell also had a keen interest in

the religious dogma of his era. There are many

 

 
“CAMPBELL. FAMILY Sketch [16]
Tetters from Johnston Taylor of Philadelphia to
Campbell during the early 1800's usually on
Swedenborgianism. Campbell wrote many letters
to Rev. James P. Carrell of Russell county
Virginia in 1849-50 relating to the origin of
the Methodist Church around Abingdon and on
religious dogma; Campbell, realizing that the
letters might be of value, obtained them after
Carrell's death, David Campbell's philosophical
approach to questions of religious import marked
him as a deist. He was, in facet, an excellent
example of the eighteenth century philosopher.

Although he could not be called vain, he was

 

 
CAMPBELL FAMILY 17

 

aware that his career was of some importance.
On the whole, however, he was a remarkably able
man although the Dictionary of American Biog-
raphy carries no sketch of his life.

 

ARTHUR CAMPBELL, One of the early series
of letters of the collection was written by
Arthur Campbell (1742-1811) chiefly to his
nephew, David (1779-1859). Arthur Campbell

ar. . e married Margaret Campbell, the sister

of General William Campbell of King's Mountain.
Arthur Campbell's letters (1785-181]) were often
written from "Goodwood" probably near Abingdon,
Va. In his kter years he wrote from Cumberland
Gap, near Middleboro, Ky., where he died; his
letters are disquisittons on democratic govern-

ment. He evidenced wide reading on ancient
Greece, and the French philosophers like Abbé
Raynal. He also followed the events of the
French Revolution with keen interest and frequ-
ently deplored the rise of despotism under

Nepoleon, Few letters evince the interest of

Revolutionary leaders in the problem of estab

include reminiscences of Revolutionary fighting.

JUDGE DAVID CAMPBELL OF TENNESSEE,
David Campbell (1753-1832), the son of "Black
David Campbell" (1710 - 1753) and Jane (Conynghe
Campbell, married Margaret Campbell, the aunt
of Governor David Campbell. Of this marriage
there were several children, including Maria Ham-
11ton(1783-1859), who became the wife of

Governor David Campbell; David Campbell (4283 )-

~CAMPBELI FAMILY Sketch [20]

who was the father of Governor Wil iam Bowen
Campbell; and General John (1776-1858) of Ark.
In 1785, David Yampobell (1753-1832) and his

wife settled near Knoxville and built a block
house for protection gainst the Indians; their
location came to be known as Campbell's Station.
David Campbell's letters (1753-1832) are chiefl

to his daughter, Maria Hamilton (Campbell) Camp-
bell (1783 - 1859). He was amember of the
Tenessee legislature early in the state's hist-
ory. His youngest sister, Anne, married Archi-
bald Roane (1759-Jan. 3, 1819), who became

governor of Tennessee in 1801, and later served

 
CAMPBELL FAMILY Sketch [21]

as judge of the Supreme Court of Tennessee from
1811 until his death. Among the earlier letters
of this set there are many written by David
Campbell (1753-1832) and by Archibald Roane.

 

MARIA HAMILTON (CAMPBELL) CAMPBELL (1783-1859)
Maria Hamilton Campbell, who in later years

Changed her name to "Mary", was the daughter of
Judge David Campbell (1753-1832), prominent in
the early history of Tennessee, the wife of
Governor David Campbell (1779-1859), the niece
of Governor Archibald Roane (1759-1819), the

Sister of General John - (1776-1858) of

 
CAMPBELL FAMILY Sketch [22] )
Arkansas, who was a colonel during the war of
1812, and afterwards in the regular U.S. Army.
During the early years coveréd by this collect-
ion there are many of her letters; due to an

attack of rheumatism she wrote few latters after
1830.

OWEN LETTERS

 

Interspersed among the Campbell papers are
the letters of the Owen family, originally from
Granville Co., N.C. Ultimately Dr. John Owen
(Aug. 31, 1787*Sept. 5, 1826), educated
in Philadelphia under Dr. Berijamin 4ush, married

Mary Amis Goodwin and —_ moved to Carthage, Tenn,

 
Campbell Family 23
in 1812, The Owen and Goodwin families were
connected with the Grant and Amis families,

Frances Isabella Owen (Feb. 5, 1818-Mar. 22,

1864), daughter of Dr, John Owen, married Wm.
Bowen Campbell (1807-1867), a circumstance
which explains the presence of these letters in
the Campbell papers. Among the letters in this

 

 

group perhaps the most. significant are those of
Daniel Grant, a Methodist minister in Ga. from
1788 until about 1796; his letters describe

meetings of the Methodists, opposition of the
Baptists and most graphically of all the dis-

 
Campbell Family 24.
turbances of his own conscience over the matter
of owning slaves (Note especially letters Sept.
3, 1790 and Sept. 15, 1791. See also letters of
Thomas Owen, Nov. 8, 1800 describing an instance
of the Great Revival). By 1805 letters of the
Owen family were frequently written from Wilkes
County, Ga. The letters of John Owen written

 

from Philadelphia while a medical student (1810-
1812) are of interest. Later Dr. John Owen's
sons, Dr. Benjamin Rush Owen (Sept. 15, 1813-
July 23, 1849) and Dr. John Owen (June 21, 1825-
April 16, 1889), also wrote very interesting

 
Campbell Family 20
Tetters while medical students in Philadelphia.

"MAJOR" JOHN CAMPBELL

John Campbell (17897-1867), the son of John
and Elizabeth (McDonald) Campbell and the broth-
er of Governor David Campbell (1779- -1859), wrote
some of the most valuable letters in this col-
lection. His long public career in Richmond,

 

Alabama, and Washington, D. C., threw him in
contact with the leading figures of the country.
He attended Princeton in 1806 and completed his

formal education at Washington College, Lexing-
ton Va., in 1807 and 1808, In 1809 he read law

 
CAMPBELL . FAMILY Sketch [26]

in Staunton, V=.and during the fall of that ye
ar was admitted to the bar in his native county,
Washington County,Va. In the spring of 1810 he
was elected to the State Legislature of Va. fro
Washington County and was reelected in the foll
Owing year, At the seesion of the Legislature
in 1810-11, he was chosen a member of the Exe-

 

cutive Council where he served for six years.
In the aprang of 1817 he resigned from the Ex-

ecutive Youncil, visited his brother, James, in
Tennessee and became impressed with stories of
easy wealth in Alabama.

 
CAMPBELL. FAMTLY Sketch [27

went to Alabama, arriving when the Convention
was being called to form a state constitution.
To that body he was made secretary in 1818,
Either because of poor health or disappointment 4
at not being made secretary of state in Alabama,
John Campbell returned to Virginia in the fall
of 1819, and the members of the Legislature,
hearing of his return, elected him to the Counci
again. He continued as a member of the Council
until May 26, 1829 when he was made treasurer
of the United States by Andrew Jackson. “his

 

 
Campbell Family 28

 

position he held until July 20, 1839. From
1839 to his death, probably during the Civil
War, John Campbell lived near Abingdon, Va.
at his father’s old home known as Hall's
Bottom, He was unmarried,

The letters written by John Campbell fall
into four categories according to the places

from which he wrote: (1) Princeton University
(2) Richmond,

(continued on next card)

 
 

CAMPBELL . FAMTLA Sketch [ 29)
(3) Alabama, (4) Washington.

Gohn Campbell's letters from Princeton to his
brother David (1779-1859) seem to furnish a com-
Plete picture of student life at that institutio
in 1806. He gives details connected with his

trip to Princeton, his living arrangements and
his studies. In these letters, John Campbell

seemed to regard his brother David in the light
of a father; apparently it was David who furn-
ished the ambition for the family. John Campbel
letters from Washington and Staunton, Va. are

equally as good as “o- Princeton,

 
Campbell Family 30
When in the Legislature and on the Executive
Council, John Campbell was intimately acquainted
with the prominent men who frequented Richmond
and consequently his letters contain intimate
details concerning these men and events of the
period from 1810 to 1817 and from 1819 to 1829.
Among the men mentioned in intimate fashion were

 

James Monroe, William Wirt, Spencer Roane,
Thomas Ritchie, Philip Pendleton Barbour,
William Cabell Rives, Winfield Scott and others
equally as prominent, As an indication of the

interesting

John Campbell went to Washington iA 1829
to become treasurer of the United States, having
been appointed by Andrew Jackson. He was
accompanied by his brother David (1779-1859)

 

who introduced him to the leading figures then
in the capital. John Campbell became an intimat
friend of Andrew Jackson and pennéd many descr-

lotions of the happenings in Washington to his
brother, David, His letters give many details

 
CAMPBELL. FAMILY Sketch [34]

of the Peggy O'Neale dispute, varioug public
figures at Washington, the storage of specie in
1837, Van Buren's sub-treasury scheme. During
the first years of his stay in Washington John
Campbell's most intimate friends were William
Segar Archer and Asbury Dickéns but later he
was more closely associated with Louis McLane,

 

attourney general under Andrew Jackson.

Although the entire Campbell collection refl
ects the rise ofthe Whig party, the letters writ
ten by J hn Campbell are especially good on this
Point. Asa matter Of fact, William B. Campbel

 
CAMPBELL. FAMTLY Sketch [35]

(1807-1867) was the first of the family to break

away from “ndrew Jackson's leadership but let-

ters of other members of the family probably

reveal more of the origin of the Whig party.
John Campbell disappeared from public life

in 1839, and during the ramainder of his life
apparently did little besides ride around the

 

neighborhood of Abingdon. He found time for a
few political letters which were published in
the Virginia papers and he contributed sketches
of Arthur Campbell (1742-1811) and William Camp-
bell of King's Mountain to Henry Howe's :

Many valuable letters of this collection alth-
ough he never attained the distinction reached
by his two elder brothers, Arthur Cempbell's
letters evidence a sound education but apparen-
tly there is no clue as to how it was obtained .
Arthur Campbell was engaged in merchantile pur-

suite at Rogersville; Carthage, Nashville and
Lebanon, Tenn, from 1868 until 1811 and probably
longer. Before 1831 he returned to Abingdon
and began the practice of law, but about that

time he was defeated in an election for District

 
CAMPBELL. FAMILY Sketch [38]

Attorney in the Abingdon district. In 1831 he
went to Washington, D.C. and through the inf-
luence of his brother, John, obtained a clerk-
Ship in the auditor's department. ~This position
he held until 1851 when he returned to Abingdon
because of very poor health. Apparently his
death took place in 1868. He was never married.

 

During his firs’years in Washington he was
intimate with Andrew Jackson and many of the
most distinguished men who frequented Washington

His letters are therefore of considerable int-
erest, BY the end of era,

 
CAMPBELL , FAMILY Sketch [39]

however, Arthur Campbell had less to do with
the great and near great. For a time during
1845, his letters contain much about ‘thomas -
Ritchie since the two lived together for some
time during that year, As a whole, Arthur
Campbell's letters reveal worthwhile material
regarding many events in Washington from 1831
to 1851. His early letters from Tennessee also
reflect many interesting facts concerning fron-
tier life in that state,:

ames Campbell was the brother of Governor
David, John, and Arthur, Born January 1794
and reared at Hall's Bottom near Abingdon,
James Campbell spent at least two years (1811-
1812) in college at Greeneville, Tenn. There-
after he read law and in 1816 or earlier
began to practice law in Tennessee, He settled’
at Winchester, Tenn, and in 1822 married
Musidora Anderson of which

 

 
CAMPBELL, FAMILY Sketch [41]

union seven children were born. James Campbell's
law practice was good. In addition, he served
in the Tennessee legislature in 1827-8, 1829-30,
and again in 1834, In the fall of 1834 he moved
to Nashville, tenn. where he died in 1848., elé-
ven years after the death of his wife. Three

of his sons died before he did.

he wrote many letters describing the migration
of settlers into the new country. He also
wrote careful accounts of the work of the Tenn-
essee legislature when he was a member of that
body, Many of his letters contain discus_sions
Of intricate legal points. Campbell, like his
elder brother, David; was an omniverous reader
ef historical and dramatic literature and oftan
devoted entire letters to his readings. He enj-
oyed theatr‘cal performancea and when perform-

of Shakesvearian plays. At the time of his deatl

DAVID CAMPBELL (1781-1841)
Among the profusion of "Davids" in the Campba
family, this David Campbell (1781-1841) may be

best identified by his relationship to Governor
William Bowen Campbell. David Campbell (1781-
1841) and Catherine (Bowen) Campbell (1785-1868)

were the parents of William Bowen Campbell a

Tenn., the son of David and Margaret (Campbell)
Campbell. He became a merchant in Wilson County
Tenn., but failed in business in 1837 because

of lending money on uncertain security. At that

 

time aged 55, he made several unprofitable trips
to Arkansas in an effort to sell to settlers and
Indians.

He wrote many letters to his children William

in 1833, probably before he reached the prime

of life. By 1814, Edward Campbell was a lawyer
in Abingdon. He married Rhoda Trigg and of the
union eight children were born. Edward C,mpbell
went to Kentucky, probably more than once, to
investigate land titles and wrote letters des-
Cribing his trip. Of most value among the let-
ters which he wrote are those concerned with the
Virginia Convention of 1829 although there are

William 5, Yampbell was born in Sumner County

Tenn., Feb. 1, 1807,. His father, despite failuré
in business, was a man of industry and education
having been a school teacher, and his mother was
noted for her industry, piety and patriotism.
After his schooling, started by his parents and
completed by his uncle David, William B. Cgmpbel

began to practice law in Carthage, Tenn, during
January 1830.

In 1835 William B. Campbell married Frances
Tsabellefwen from which union ten children were

born; three of their children died young and one
William B. Jr., died at the age of twenty-two.
For several years the family lived with the Owen

Campbell moved into his own home also in Carthagy
In 1853 he moved his family to a small farm on
the edge of Lebanon, Tenn., which farm Governor

 

David Campbell had previously bought for the
family by William B. Campbell's mother.
Soon after beginning the practice of law in

1830, William B, Campbell ventured into politics
and military action, holding the following

In the brief intervals of public employment,
William B, Campbell engaged in business pur-
suits. He carried on small farming operations
regularly, During 1846, Campbell, in addition
to his law practice, Sperated a store and tobac+
co stemmery in Carthage, Tenn. In this venture
he had partners, but his interests were

 

watched by his brother David, while he was in
the Mexican War. After his term as @vernor of
Tennessee, Campbell, with financial aid from
his uncle David, entered into

 
CAMPBELL, FAMILY Sketch [537
partnership with a firm of commission merchants
in New Orleans. Campbell entered the firm know
as Perkins, Campbell and So, July 15, 1853.

At the same time he served as agent in New Or-
leans for the Branch Bank of Tennessee. Accord
ing to his nature, Yagmpbell soon became dissat-
fied with the commission business and considereé

 

that he had been cheated; he sold his share in
the firm on Yec. 6, 1855. During this period
he spent much of his time in New Orleans. Soon

afterwards he entered the banking business as

as president of the Bank of M4ddle Tennessee at
Lebanon, Tenn. He saved a large part of the
bank's funds by depositing gold infbank at Ind-

War.

The papers of William B. Campbell center ar-
ound (1) ante-bellum politics in Tennessee, (2)

 

Civil War Activities (3) military exploits (4)
business activities (5) family correspondence.
Campbell's correspondence during ante-bellum

years may be summarized in terma of the Whig
party. He was “@ he Whigs from the

 
CAMPBELL" FAMILY “Sketch [55)

beginning and was the last Whig governor of
Tennessee. The correspondence contains letters
from such political leaders as Balie Peyton,
Ephraim H. Foster, Felix K. Zollicoffer,
Meredith P. Gentry, Samuel M. Fite, and others
equally as well known. Many of Zollicoffer's
letters are concerned with Campbell's campaign
for governor in 1851. Cgmpbell also received
letters from many of his colleagues in Congress
including several letters from Henry Clay.

William Sowen Campbell, through the influence
of his uncle David, the participation of his

 

 
CAMPBELL, FAMILY ___ Sketch [56]

ancestors in the Battle of King's Mountain and
‘perhaps partially his own peraonal convictions,
was a Union man throughout the Civil War. He
was associated with William G. Brownzow but

came to dislike him. On the other hand, he dis-
liked Andrew Johnson at first but after the Wer
as a Congressman, became closely associated with

 

Johnson, Throughout the War he remained a sta-
unch Unionist, but his papers show that he pro-
bably regretted his stand when the raéicals of

pomerpes bagan amending the Constitution with

such vigor after 1865. The letters in the late

 
CAMPBELL . FAMILY Sketch [57]

1850's and in 1861 are filled with plans to pre-
vent Tennessee's secession and there are several
interesting references to "armed neutrality of
the Border States" as a method for preventing
war, During & period of Confederate supremacy
Campbell was forced to remain away from his home
His name was mentioned in 1864 as a candidate

 

for vice-president on the Democratic ticket with
George B. McClellan. One of Campbell's friends
thought that failure to place Campbell's name

on the ticket was due to the treachery of
of Emerson Etheridge, a_loyal Tennesseean who

 
CAMPBELL, FAMILY Sketch [58]
wished to have his own name on the ticket. The
collection ¢ntains numerous letters (1862-66)
from imprisoned Confederates begging Campbell' s
aid in obtaining release. Campbell also receiveé
numerous letters from such Conserfative mémbers
of Congress in 1865-66 as Edmund Cooper, Emerson
Etheridge, and W.B. Stokes (also Jordan Stokes).
Campbell had experience in tle Indian War in
Alabama and Florida during 1836-7, in the Mexica
War, was offered tle command of the Western Mil-
itary District, Tennessee, C.S.A, but refused
and also refused to hold a brigadier general ship

in the U.S. Army for any length of time. He
wrote numerous letters to his wife and his uncle
David while in the Indian wars, usually from
Fort Mitchell, Ala. and points in Florida; some
describe the country side arid some the fighting
on the Withlacoochee River when the famous chief
Osceola, was chased.- When the Mexican War calle

 

him, Campbell achieved fame at the Battle of
Monterey with his command, "Boys, Folla Me !"
His letters describe the fighting, the country

side and the bickering of officers. Many letters
by and about Gideon J, , are included and

referred to as a very precocious child. She
attended school a short while in Tenn. but when
eleven or twelve years of age she was carried
| to her uncle David's (1779-1859) home in Abing-
don. He sent her to school and supervised her
education. In fact, he took unusual pride in the
development of her mind as proof that a "female

her and became responsible for her expenditures

| Campbell and his wife when he served as governor
of Virginia and went with them on a northern
tour in 1838. She frequently made the trip from
Abingdon, Va. to Lebanon, Tenn, In 1849 she
married the Rev. William Shelton, a Baptist min-
ister then at Clarksville, Tenn. He soon became
a member of the faculty of Union University, a

 

Baptist institution in Murfreesboro, Tenn, but
he also continued his preaching from time to
time, In the fall of 1856, William Shelton
established the Brownsville Female Academy in
Brownsville Tenn., and remained there until

 
Campbell Family 63
early in 1866 when he became president of the
West Tennessee College in Jackson, Tenn., at
that time a state school and the first in the
state to reopen after the War. They had seven
children, one of whom died in infancy. Virginia
Tabitha Jane (Campbell) Shelton died in Jackson,
Tenn., Apr. 18, 1867 at the age of 47[?7].

 

Virginia Tabitha Jane (Campbell) Shelton was
a woman with a superior education and from
early years she was very observant. She also
wrote easily and noted many details. Hence
her letters written from various points in

 
CAMPBELL. FAMILY Sketch [64]

Tennessee, chmond, and Abingdon, Va., contain
an infinite amount of information on household
economy, dress, slavery, methods of transportat-
fon, literary works, the conditions of the col-
leges in which her husband taught and in which
she frequently assisted, She also frequently
commented on political campaigns and her letters

 

from Richmond (1837-40) contain an excellent
picture of life in the governor's mansion at
that time. In fact her letters contain a wealth

of information on many subjects,

OTHER LETTERS
argaret Hamilton Campbell, the second sis-
ter of William Bowen Campbell, also wrote many
letters contained in thts set. They usually
bear on family affairs. She was a devout Metho
dist and revealed the fact in her letters. Th-
ere are several letters in this collection wr-

 

itten by "Adine Turner" during the 1850's from
near Columbus, Miss. to a cousin. The conn-
ection of "Adine Turner" with other characters

of this collection is not evident but Poe let-

538 items added, 7-10-73: Correspondence

and other papers from 1811 to 1969. The primary
family represented in this addition is the
Campbell Family, but there are papers for
several related families, including the Owens,
Montgomerys, Kelleys, and Newnans. See the
genealogical charts and other material filed

with this collection for the relationships of
these families. Throughout the papers there
are many family letters exchanged among these
relatives.

Much of the correspondence from about 1811

 
Campbell Family 74
through 1831 is concerned with the settling of
Hugh Montgomery's estate and a Moravian tract
on that land. A set of legal papers (1779- -1830)
in a folder entitled, "Hugh Montgomery's Papers,'
also relates to these subjects. There was a
question as to who actually owned the large
tract of land in Wythe County, Virginia, and a

 

piece of land formerly owned by, the Moravians,
which were a part of Montgomery's estate when
he died in 1779. The four principal heirs
involved were daughters of Montgomery and their
husbands: Dr. and Mrs. Anthony Newnan, Col.

Letters in the 1830's include two from

Daniel Newnan, U.S. Congressman from Georgia,

in 1832 in which he discussed Andrew Jackson,

Sam Houston, and corrupt politicians. William
Bowen Campbell is represented by letters he
wrote, from the 1830's through the 1860's, to
various persons, including a series to Governor
David Campbell. In them he spoke of politics,

 
Campbell Family 76
elections, banks, social events, Martin Van
Buren, and Henry Clay. He expressed his pro-
union sentiments before the Civil War, and
after the war told of the soldiers coming home
and of his hope that there would bea "forgive

There is correspondence to and from David C.
Kelley in the 1850's, particularly during his
time in medical school at the University of
Nashville. His first wife, Amanda (Harris)
Kelley, wrote in 1855 from China, where they
were missionaries. Letters in the 1850's and

 

 
 

eee Family 77
's refer to Governor Campbell's illness and
death and the settling of his estate. Mary
Owen (Campbell) Kelley, David Kelley's second
wife, is represented by correspondence to and
from her in the 1870's and 1880's. In the
1890's and early twentieth century are letters
for David and David C. Kelley, Jr.

The Genealogical material includes two
notebook tablets containing copies of North
Carolina and Tennessee wills, deeds, marriage
records, and other documents, They pertain to
the Wherry, Bowen, Montgomery, Newnan, Campbell,

 
Campbell Family 78
and Kelley families, among others. A letter
of November 29, 1938 (filed with the corres-
pondence) contains Montgomery family genealogy.
Writings include religious pieces, poetry,
and a holograph manuscript signed by David C.
Kelley entitled, "A New Philosophical Discov-

ery." An interesting item describes the

 

"Candler-Abbott affair," an incident showing
the church's disdain for the theater. In the
printed material are leaflets and booklets,

one called "Dedication Sermon, Fort Donelson
Memorial Chapel" by DavidC.Kelley and another

 
Campbell Family 79

 

a booklet in memory of his wife, Mary. The
miscellany includes an invitation in 1829 from
President Jackson to Col. David Campbell.

There are clippings on David and Mary Kelley,
the naming of Camp Campbell for William Bowen
Campbell in 1942, churches, and the Prohibition
party in 1890. Several are about General

Nathan B. Forrest, and an oversize clipping in
the picture cabinet tells of an assault in
which his troops delivered the town of Murfrees-

Campillo y Cosfo, José del.

 

Jos€ del Campillo y Cosfo (1693-1743) was a
ministerial official of Philip V of Spain.
After the death of his father, he moved in 1708
to Cérdoba and became the page of Don Antonio
Maldorado. Five years later he began his gov-
ernment service as secretary of the intendente,
Don Francisco Ocio. He continued his career in
the cuerpo de contadurfa de marina in which he
became comisario de guerra. He was accused of
heresy before the Inquisition but was able to

 

 

 
Campillo y Cosio, José del 2
prove his innocence. He became an intendente
and served the Italian and Aragonese armies in
the 1730's. The king summoned him to Madrid
and granted him the secretarfa or ministerio de
Hacienda (1741). He later served in the Marina

%

and the Guerra e Indias. His bibliography in-
cludes several works on governmental subjects.
One of them was his Nuevo sistema de Govierno
Economico para la America... that was written
in 1743 but not published until 1789. Duke
Library has a printed copy. In the prologue

of the pub- (continued on card 3)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Campillo y Cosfo, José del 3

 

lished work the editor discussed whether or not
the Nuevo sistema was actually written by
Campillo y Cosfo and decided that it was. The
manuscript used by the editor was only a copy
of the original or of another copy.

The origin of the manuscript of the Nuevo
sistema is unknown. It bears some resemblance

 

to the manuscript described by the editor of
the printed text and has characteristics that
he expected of copies (see pages 4-5 of the

prologue).

José del Campillo with Don José Patino, Spanish
Prime Minister (correspondence, 17313; 1735-36)
and with the Duque de Montemar, General of the
Italien Expedition (1734-35). The subject of
the correspondence is the Spanish military ex-
peditions in Italy in the early 1730's.

Canning, Charles John, Esrl Canning. Papers,
1859-1862. London, England

 

Charles John Canning, Earl Canning (1812-
1862), British administrator, served as under
secretary of state for foreign affairs (1841-
1846), postmaster general (1853-1855), and
governor general Of India (1856-1862). Im 1858

the control of India was transferred from the
East India Company to the crown, and Canning
became the first viceroy.

Canning had a distinguished career as

governor general of Indias One of the most im-

 
Canning, Charles John, Earl Canning 2
portant events with which he had to contend was
the mutiny of the Bengal Army in 1857 and 1858.
A manuscript minute (24 folios) in this collec-
tion relates to this crisis for British rule in
India. It is entitled "Services of Civil Of-
ficers and others during the Mutiny and Rebel-
lion." Folio twenty-four bears Canning's sig-

 

nature and the date of July 2, 1859. The minute
is written to a secretary of state (ff. 1,10),
presumably the secretary of state for India, at
this time, Sir Charles Wood, First Viscount Hal-
fax. This document constitutes an official

 
Canning, Charles John, Earl Canning
recognition by the Indian government of the
services of civil: dfficials, and also military
officers in civil employ, during the mutiny of
1857 to 1858. It consists of lists of offi-'
cials, the offices which they held, and often
general remarks about their services. Some of
the higher administrators receive long para-

 

graphs of commendation,

The minute begins with a summary statement
about the mutiny (ff. 1-2) and continues with
recognition of officials in various provinces.

 
Canning, Charles John, Earl Canning 4
Long Lists of officials are cited for the fol-
lowing provinces: Bengal(ff. 3-5), North West
Provinces (ff, 5-11), Central India (ff. 11-13),
Punjab (ff. 14-17), and Oudh (ff. 17-20).

Folios 21 to 24 concern departments of the Gov-
ernment of India. The following provinces are
noted briefly; Rajputana (f. 13), Hyderabad

 

(ff. 13-14), and Baroda (f. 14). The Department
of the Superintendent of Marine, apparently for
Bengal, is noted on folios 20 to 21.

 
Canning, Charles John, Earl Canning 5

 

1 item added, 4-1-63. Cenning retired as
governor general of India in March, 1862, and
returned to England where he died in June. On
April 24, 1862, Canning wrote from Marseilles
to Sir William Fanshawe Martin, Fourth Baronet,
vice admiral in command of the Mediterranean
station. Canning returned to Europe on the

Banshee, which had engine failure, and he

criticized the Admiralty for continuing to use
a vessel with its weaknesses. Martin sent the
Amphion to replace the Banshee for part of the

trip, and Canning wrote to thank him.

 
 

Canning, Charles John, Earl Canning 6
2 items added, 9-24-70: On June 17, 1842,
Canning squelched rumors about Lord Stuart de
Rothesay's health and reported his plans to
return to his ambassadorial post in Russia, He
also asked for information on the Guiana
boundary. His letter of July 16, 1842, to
Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst concerned the signing
of warrants on an agreement with Portugal.

Canning, George. Papers, 1797-1827. London,
England.

 

This item is a routine official letter of
instruction from British Foreign Minister
George Canning to Commissary Judge John Tasker
Williams, dated Sept. 10, 1825, ordering
him to proceed to Sierra Leone, West Africa,

and to enter upon his duties with the Mixed
Commissions, which had been established by
three treaties to prevent illegal slave

trade. These treaties were between Great
Britain and Spain (Sept. 23, 1817), Great
Britain and Portugal 6 28, 1817) and Great

 
Canning, George 2
Britain and the Netherlands (May 4, 1818).

2 items added 10-8-58. In 1807, George Cann-
ing had become Foreign Minister in the ministry
of the Duke of Portland. The 1808 item is a
copy of a letter to Canning from Spencer Perceval
which reflects the British sympathy for the
Spanish cause in that year. It details the poss-
{bilities of sending dollars to Spain with the
limit at one million unless Parliament were call-
ed,

On April 10, 1827, Canning was asked by
George IV to form a ministry, a difficult task
as several outstanding leaders resigned within

 

 
Canning, George 3
two or three days, among whom was Lord Bexley.
Therefore the letter in this collection from
Canning to Bexley, written Apr. 11, 1827,
appears strange since Canning is joyous over
Bexley's "prompt and frank acquiescence in the
proposition." He goes on to state that His

 

Majesty particularly desires him to tell him
that if all the elements of Lord Liverpool's
(Charles Cecil Cope Jenkinson, Third Earl of
Liverpool) administration are not kept together
it is not His Majesty's fault.

 
Canning, George 4

2 items added 7-30-58; The first is a Llet-
ter of May 28, 1817, by Canning to Dennis
O'Bryen, discussing the London Pitt Club's con-
troversial and anti-Catholic toasts to "Protest-
ant Ascendancy," certain resolutions of the
club, etc. He states that he does not choose
to go to a meeting of the club to be insulted.

Canning writes on Dec. 4, 1826, to Lord
Binning, mentioning one Lushington.

Two items added, 9-23-60: Letter of Nov. 3,
1814, refers to personal business payments. On
May 6, 1824, Canning declined to make an appoin
ment requested by John ler, editor of the Sun
a Troy paper.

 

 

 
Canning, George 5

 

He noted that the position of a British attache
was desirable only for those who were sustained
by a private fortune.

l item added, 9-1-62. On April 1, 1822,
William Adam (1751-1839), politician and jurist
writes to George Canning, newly appointed

governor general of India. He writes in behalf
of John Adam, his son, who is a member of the
Supreme Council of Bengal. William Adam recounts
the career of his eldest son whom he has not
seen for twenty-six years, for John Adam went
to India before he was sixteen and has not

 
Canning, George 6
visited England since then. in September can-
ning resigns his appointment to India, and
during part of 1823 John Adam, senior member
of the council, serves as acting governor gen-
eral of India.

2 items added, 5-29-64. On Jan. 6, 1827,
Canning informs the Duke of Cambridge of the
death of his brother, the Duke of York. The
letter of Dec. 30, 1815, is a routine communi-
cation from Canning to Francis Freeling, secre-
tary of the General Post Office.

summer of 1797 Lord Malmesbury negotiated in
vain with the French for an end to the war.
In July the British also apparently attempted
to negotiate with Carnot through a M. Du Buc
St. Olympe. An unsigned memorandum of July
23, 1797, from Keston, Eng., records
consultation between Canning and the unidentifi
writer about the proposed mission. On the
second page there is a letter to Canning of
Aug. 1 in which the writer noted his
conversation with Du Buc St. Olympe prior to

 
Canning, George 8
his departure for France.

On June 19,1809, Canning wrote to Prince
Starhemberg, the Austrian envoy in London,
and discussed the problem of how to transfer
150,000 pounds from the British treasury
to Austria. He commented on the possibility
of utilizing the bank of Sir Francis
Baring for this purpose.

On Dec. 17, 1823, Canning directed Thomas
Peregrine Courtenay how to handle a request
from Courtenay's friend and colleague, Mr.
Bent, probably John Bent, M.P. Both Courtenay

Cannon, James, Jr. Papers. Richmond, Va. and
Washington, D. C,

 

This collection consists of the letters and
papers of James Cannon, Jr. (November 13, 1864-
September 6, 1944), ,Bishop of the Methodist

o“Gvocate of prohibition, and
an important figure in national political af-

fairs during the 1920's. Bishop Cannon was born
in Salisbury, Md., and received his A. B. from
Randolph-Macon College and his M. A. and B. D.
from Princeton University. He entered the

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 2
ministry as a member of the Virginia Conference
of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South in 1888
and was elected a bishop in 1918.

The earliest item in this collection is a
copy of a letter from Robert E. Lee, dated
December 6, 1869, expressing the opinion that
abstinence from alcohol was a good policy.

This letter was copied from Personal Reminis-
cences, Anecdotes, and Letters of Gen. Robert E.
Lee by John William Jones. It was apparently
used by Cannon in his temperance work,

 

 

 

 

 
Cannon, James, Jr. 4
Cannon was founder of the Blackstone College

for Girls and served as its president from

1894 to 1918. There are many items relative

to the administration of the school and manage-

ment of its finances, There are also copies

of sermons which he delivered there. From 1899

to 1903, he edited the Methodist Recorder, a

 

 

weekly newspaper, from Blackstone. In 1904, he
became one of the editors of the Richmond
Christian Advocate, after merging his Recorder
with the Advocate. He continued as editor until

 

 
Cannon, James, Jr,

his election as bishop in 1918. The early
portion of this collection contains material
relative to his editorial work and typed copies
of articles which he wrote. As early as 1900,
there is evidence of enmity between Cannon and
Richmond newspapers.

In 1902, Cannon became a member of the execu-
tive committee of the Anti-Saloon League of
America and from 1910 to 1919 served as
superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of
Virginia. Many items in the collection relate

 

 
Cannon, James, Jr. _
to this aspect of his career. A copy of a
letter written on January 16, 1905 by Senator
Thomas Staples Martin to Cannon concerns a bill
to protect Indians from the sale of alcohol.
From 1918 to 1934, he was Chairman of the Board
of Temperance and Social Service of the Metho-
dist Episcopal Church, South and from 1919 until
his death was chairman of the executive commit-
tee of the World League Against Alcoholism.

In the latter capacity, he attended world
conferences at Geneva, Stockholm, London, and

 

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 6
Paris and was brought into direct contact with
the temperance leaders of the world. Cannon
wrote reports on these conferences in journal
form and copies of them are part of this
collection,

In 1911, letters were exchanged between Can-
non and William Hodges Mann relative to a charge

 

by Cannon's enemies that friends had tried to
have Mann appoint Cannon to the United States
Senate. There is also a copy of a letter from
Woodrow Wilson to E. W. Geogan (1911) on the

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 7
prohibition issue and letters from numerous
other political leaders regarding the activities
of the Anti-Saloon League.

Included with the material for 1913 is an
abstract of titles prepared by Smothers, Morgan
and Ward, attorneys of Waynesville, N. C. for
the Southern Assembly, apparently concerning

 

lands for this organization at Lake Junaluska,
N. C. Cannon evidently was a promoter of the
assembly grounds. He bought several tracts of
land in Junaluska, and there are many letters

 
Cannon, James, Jr.

 

indicating that he was extremely active in
affairs there for the rest of his life.

Cannon was general superintendent of the
Southern Assembly from 1911 to 1919 and was five
times a member of the General Conference of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The minutes

and reports
included in
records for

evidence that Bishops Denny and Kilgo opposed
his election, Cannon's episcopal area included
Supervision of missionary work in Mexico, Cuba,
Brazil, and Africa. Among his papers are cor-
respondence with missionaries in the field,
considerable information on the issue of church
and state relations in Mexico, and records in

journal form of the many trips he made to the
missions under his care.

By 1920, Cannon had become a leader in the
movement for the unification of the northern

 
Cannon, James, Jr. 10
and southern branches of Methodism. There is a
vast amount of material about this project.
The proposals for unification were voted down
several times, but success was finally achieved
in 1939, and Cannon lived to attend united con-
ferences after he retired in 1938.

There is a telegram from Woodrow Wilson in

 

1920 appointing Cannon to a committee to secure
popular subscriptions for aiding famine victims
in China, and there are mimeographed copies of

articles written in 1922 on such matters as

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 12
and there is evidence of opposition from within
and without his church throughout his career,

A man of outspoken opinions, untiring energy,
and brilliant oratorical ability, Cannon could
not avoid incurring some opposition. In the
material for 1921, there is a leaflet entitled
"The Effort to have Bishop Cannon Removed from
the Presidency of the Alabama Conference."
Several times later in his life, more serious
efforts to divest him of his authority were
made, but he was always able to defend himself

 

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 11
world suffering, affairs of the Greeks and
Armenians, problems in the Near East, and the
League of Nations. Cannon was in favor of
United States membership in the League of
Nations and was worried about American isola-
tionism, As early as November 15, 1923, there
is a copy of a speech made by Cannon on the re-

 

fusal of the United States to accept world
leadership. There is also a long article on his
trip to Russia in 1924,

Bishop Cannon was a controversial figure,

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 13
before the highest church boards and the legal
courts of the nation.

Cannon's correspondence in 1923 contains
several letters relative to the sale of small
quantities of stock, and in 1924, W. Asbury
Christian, Cannon's successor at Blackstone,
accused the bishop of dealing in stocks. There

 

is a copy of a letter dated January 29, 1926
written to the Merchants Trust Company in New
York to find out about a brokerage company.
In a letter dated August 16, 1927, Cannon

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 14
mentioned one thousand shares of General Motors
selling options and margin speculation. In
December, 1927, he invested $3,424 in Northern
Ohio stock and $2,117 in American Linseed Com-
pany. In 1925 and 1926, however, funds had been
solicited to buy a house for him as a testimoni-
al to his twenty-five years of work. Since

 

Cannon had allegedly given all that he had
($60,000) to prohibition work, he was presumed
to be umable to buy a house. A letter dated
July 15, 1925, indicates that $15,000 was soli-

cited.

 
Cannon, James, Jr, os
Despite criticism by many Methodists and
others for meddling in politics, Cannon became a
national figure in 1928 through his efforts to
bring about the defeat of Alfred E. Smith, the
nominee of the Democratic Party for President
of the United States. Cannon did not, however,
defect to the Republican Party. Instead, he
became a leader of the Anti-Smith Democrats.
It was primarily due to his leadership that the
"solid South" voted for Hoover who, it was
promised, would "save the country from ruin by

 

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 16
Rum and Rome." Cannon opposed Smith because he
was “wet." He was then at the height of his
power, and his supporters were quite numerous.
There are letters from all over the country
expressing confidence in and loyalty and devo-
tion to him. Several correspondents suggested
that Cannon should be the next governor of

 

Virginia. In 1928, he was given the Christian
Herald Association award for distinguished
religious service,

During Hoover's administration, Cannon

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 17
appealed continuously for a more vigorous
enforcement of prohibition, but Andrew Mellon,
who was Secretary of the Treasury, would not
encourage appropriating the necessary funds.

In 1932 and 1936, Cannon opposed Roosevelt,
another “wet," but commanded only a small

following.

 

Cannon was called to task from 1929 to 1932
about his dealings in stocks and particularly

with reference to Anti-Smith pg Po 6] contri-
butions totalling $30,000 which could not be

 
Cannon, James, Jr. 18
accounted for. He was acquitted by the Supreme
Court and by the Council of Bishops after he
admitted having made "mistakes." Folders for
the years from 1928 to 1932 contain many items
concerning his trials, including statements,
charges, and anonymous notes. Also present are
the minutes of the Senate investigation conduct-

 

ed in 1930 into Cannon's Anti-Smith Campaign
expenditures. In 1931, a Senate committee
headed by Gerald P. Nye continued its investi-

gation; a complete copy of its hearings held in

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 19
August of that year can be found among these
papers. Cannon refused to appear until the
legality of such proceedings was proved. He

was eventually vindicated. In a letter dated
April 30, 1932, Cannon asked the church to pay
the expenses incurred by the investigations, but
was refused. He also filed suit for libel

 

against Senator G. H. Tinkham in 1932. This
case continued until 1934 when Cannon won,

after having gone to the court of appeals twice
and finally to the United States Supreme Court.

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 20
A case filed against Hearst newspapers in the
Same year for actions concerning Cannon's son in
California and his second wife was eventually
settled out of court.

After the court trials in 1930, several of
the bishops urged Cannon to resign, but his
character was exonerated. Testimony given at

 

the church hearings is included in the collec-
tion. In 1934, there was agitation to super-
annuate him, and the Board of Temperance and
Social Service which he had headed since 1919

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 21
was abolished. Cannon, whose health had been
failing, was assigned to work on the West Coast.
As soon as the prohibition amendment was

repealed, he began to urge new measures. In
1935, he persuaded Senator Sheppard to introduce
a dry amendment, but it received little support.
In 1937, he returned to Richmond as chairman of
the administrative branch of the Anti-Saloon
League. He mentioned in several letters of this
year that he was writing his autobiography. He
left this work to his son, James Cannon III, to

publish,

 

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 22
A letter to Cordell Hull dated September,
1937 concerned Japan's attacks on China. In
another letter to Secretary Hull (September l,
1938), he urged the signers of the Kellogg Pact
and the Nine Power Treaty to stop Japanese
agression in China. In 1939, he advocated
strong measures by the United States to help
stop Hitler and suggested that one such measure
might be to declare an end to the American
policy of neutrality. He also criticized Con-
gress for adjourning out of respect to the death

 

 
Cannon, James, Jr, ra |
of Pope Pius XI and a year later opposed Roose-
velt's appointment of a representative to the
Vatican. In other letters and articles, he
objected to sending food to Germany and muni-
tions to Japan. He also urged resumption of
conscription. There is a letter dated May 7,
1941 from Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox
stating that the threat to the United States
was not from Japan but from Europe.

During World War II, Cannon was a member of
the Committee to Study the Bases for a Just

 

 
Cannon, James, Jr. 24
and Durable Peace; reports of several of this
committee's meetings are included. Copies of
articles he wrote advocating a halt to liquor
Sales to servicemen and to urge Roosevelt to
order conscription on the home front as a
remedy against profiteering are also among his
papers.

 

There are many obituary notices and tributes
to Cannon included at the end of the collection.
Among these is one especially notable tribute
written by a Catholic priest and published in

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 25
the September, 1944 issue of Catholic Virginian.
The volumes are diaries kept by Cannon when

he was a young man, expense accounts, a copy of
The Doctrines and Discipline of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South (1926 edition), and
the proceedings of suit against Randolph-Macon
College at which Cannon testified.

 

 

 

 

 

The pamphlets deal principally with prohibi-
tion and the presidential campaign of 1928.

Numerous pictures deal with Cannon's trips
to Africa and Greece, European ecclesiastical

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 26
and peace conferences, and Mexican missions. A
typescript in the writings folder for 1922 con-
tains many pictures of daily life and mission
work in Africa,

The folders of writings, addresses, and state
ments and press releases contain many of the
important items pertaining to Cannon's political

 

and social concerns, while the sermons and

numerous Clippings further document the various

areas to which he devoted his activities.
Indexes to Cannon's papers were prepared by

 
Cannon, James, Jr. 27
his secretary, Ada Burroughs, and are filed in
Box 1 of the collection. They are incomplete,
however, and cannot be relied upon as accurate
listings of all of the items contained in each
box.

1 item added, 7-5-50: Drafts of Bishop
Cannon's autobiography.

 

N. Be When this collection was first given
to Duke University by James Cannon III, it was
closed to public researchers until Professor

 
Cannon, James, Jr. 28
Richard L. Watson of the Duke history department
completed a published edition of Bishop Cannon's
autobiography. The papers were opened for use
on May 21, 1955.

678 items and 2 vols. added, 4-1-69:
Correspondence, legal and financial papers,

The early letters deal almost exclusively with
Cannon's position as president and later chair-
man of the Board of Trustees of Blackstone

Female Institute and its successor, Blackstone

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 29
College. A series of letters to and from
William Newman Ainsworth concerns an ecclesias-
tical trial in which Cannon was called upon to
defend his political and personal activities
before a tribunal of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South. Among the miscellaneous items
are copies of testimony given during the

 

hearings. The trial was held in February, 1931.
Correspondence between Cannon and Robert Hayes

McNeill contains references to the Congressional
investigation of Cannon's management of campaign

 
Cannon, James, Jr, 30
funds during elections in Virginia. The letters
refer principally to a dispute over the size

of McNeill's fee for serving as Cannon's lawyer
during the investigation,

Cannon's efforts to complete his autobiogra-
phy and to finance its publication are the sub-
ject of the later correspondence in this
addition. Richard Heber Bennett undertook to
raise the money to subsidize the publication
project and solicited funds from Cannon's
friends and former students. After Cannon's

 

 
Cannon, James, Jr. ees
death and Bennett's illness, James Cannon III
took over the project. His correspondence with
publishing firms and potential editors of the
uncompleted autobiography is included among his
father's papers. Letters concerning Virginius
Dabney's biography of Bishop Cannon were also
saved by James Cannon III and have been added
to the bishop's collection.

The two volumes are a book of check stubs
with other financial records also written in
it (1918-1920) and a copy of the Cannon Ball,

Copies of letters dated December 20, 1945,
to Nannie May Tilley and Joseph Penn Breedlove
from James Cannon III stipulate the conditions
which regulated the use of Bishop Cannon's
papers from the time they were given to Duke

This collection contains the papers of Henry

Trust Company, Bloomington, Ill., and later in
the real estate business in partnership with his
father, Luman W. Capen.

The correspondenece in this collection con-=
sists of letters from friends and relatives in
Union Springs and Trumansburg, N.Y. These let-
ters contain many requests for financial advice
and assistance from Capen who served as an in-

 

 
Capen, Henry 2
vestment broker for his family and friends. The
letters concern mortgages, loans, stock pur-
chases, and leases. There are several refer-
ences to the financial conditions of 1873 and
1876. A letter of Mar. 24, 1876, to Capen con-
tains information about the bright future of

the Kansas Valley and a map of the area.

 

Luman W. Capen was treasurer of the New

This collection consists mostly of Capers'
Civil War letters to his wife dealing with war
and religion. He goes into detail about mili-
tary operations and sometimes draws maps. Herein
lies the chief value of the collection. A
number of the post-bellum letters to and from
Capers deal with ecclesiastical affairs, mostly
about the Episcopal church in S. C. The Rev.

Steinmeyer, Jr., is one of the more prolific
correspondents. Some of the more important
letters, not necessarily by Capers or Steinmeye;
are dated in Sept.-Nov., 1863,and Aug.- Sept.
1864. Some of the earlier letters in this col-
lection contain material on the history of

 

Charleston, S.C., during the Civil War.

The first item is a letter from Capers to
his wife, dated Jan. 19, 1868} when he was still
teaching at The Citadel, in Charleston, S.C.

He describes Charleston Harbor and draws a

small map of it. His a notes (Dec. ,1860-

 
Capers, Ellison 4
Apr. 1861) discuss his activities in the lst
Regt. of Rifles in the S.C. Militia in which he
served as maj. and 1t. col. Organized and
commanded by Col. (later Gen.) J.J. Pettigrew,
the regt. consisted of the following cos:_
Washington Light Inf., German Riflemen, /South/
Carolina Light Inf., Moultrie Guards, Palmetto
Lt. Inf., Zouaves, and Meaghan Guards; and
later, Beauregard Light Inf. and Charleston
Light Inf. On Dec. 20 the regt. held its first
parade. Col. Pettigrew read the S.C. Ordinance
of Secession. On the 26th, Pettigrew and Capers

 

 
Ellison
were sent by Gov. F. W. Pickens on the 26th to
Ft. Sumter to demand the return of the U. S.
forces to Ft. Moultrie. S. C. troops possessed
Ft. Moultrie and Castle Pinckney on the 27th.
The lst Regt. of Rifles went to Morris Island,
which C.S. Gen. J.J. Pettigrew commanded, while
Capers commanded the Corps of S.C. Cadets and

 

the Island's artillery, including the "Star of
the West" Battery, which on Jan. 9, 1861, turned
back the Star of the West, an unarmed U.S. mer-
chant vessel with troops and supplies to reen-
force Ft. Sumter. On Feb. 18, Capers' outfit was
relieved by Gregg's ‘6 of S. C. militia. On

 

 
 

Capers, Ellison 6
the 25th it was sent to Secessionville, 9.c. On

Mar. 5 Abraham Lincoln's inauguration is dis-
cussed. The regt. was ordered to Sullivan's
Island. Capers was in charge of the light guns
during the Bombardment of Ft. Sumter on Apr.

12 and 13, but, as the enemy made no attempt on
the Island, the light guns were not used, On

the 20th the regt.was relieved by Col. /later
Gen,/ Micah Jenkins' 5th Regt. of ©.C. Inf.
Vols. Capers gives most of the credit for the
reduction of Ft. Sumter to Lt. Col.Llater Gen.]
R.S. Ripley, an outstanding leader (pp.8-9; see
also pp. 12-13 of “~@ brief diary). Capers

 
Capers, Ellison Z
returned to The Citadel in the belief that the
war in Va. would terminate quickly, but he soon
saw that there would be a great war. The First
Battle of Manassas ended whatever, if any,

doubt there was. He had yielded at first to his
friends' persuasions instead of volunteering for
the Confederate cause. But the time had passed

 

for the S.C, Militia to be useful, except local-
ly. Gen. W. G, DeSaussure thought he could
maintain efficiency of the 4th Brig. of the

S.C, Militia and, by persisting in this course,
so disgusted the Charleston organizations with
the service they were 6° that hundreds

 
Capers, Ellison 8

 

volunteered for Confederate service and went to
Va. On p. 18 Capers denounces DeSaussure.

Writing to his wife on Jan.1, 1861, Capers
doubts Robert Barnwell Rhett, Sr.'s claim that
by Apr. England and France would recognize the
C.S.A. and break the blockade, leaving the
U;S.A. like a chicken with its head cut off. In
another letter of the same date he mentions the
C.S. Steamer Osiris. He mentions Gov. F.W.
Pickens on Feb. 14.

Capers discusses the plight of U.S. Maj.
[later Gen.] Robert Anderson on Mar. 14. S.C.
is determined to aa from being reen-

 
Capers, Ellison 9

 

forced or supplied. President Abrahgm Lincoln
must withdraw the Ft. Sumter garrison or reén-
force and supply it,but the last cannot be done
without foreign aid. Anderson has only 10 or
15 days' supply of food, so something must be
done. Capers thinks the South will win a
bloodless victory. On Mar. 24 Capers quotes
C.S. Gen. P.T,.G. Beauregard as saying that
something must be done about the Ft. Sumter
Situation in a few days. Capers opines that S.C.
will have the Ft. by Apr. 1. On Apr. 5 he has
more about the Sumter situation and says that
war is preposterous. @- 1lOth he discusses

 
Capers, “llison 10
the same situation, Anderson, Lincoln, and
Beauregard. Here, as in some other letters, he
discusses God and religion. He discusses the
Battle of Ft. Sumter on the 13th and 14th. On
the 15th he complains that credit for the vic-
tory has gone, not to his regt., but to the
"parlor knights" who did nothing. At some time
this regt. gave way to a permanent Confederate
unit, the 24th Regt. of S.C. Inf. Vols., in
which Capers served as a lt. col. (See D.A.B.,
III, 483).

Capers' diary goes from Aug. 28 to Dec. 14,
1861. He does no “~~ in this period, but

 

 
Capers, Ellison ces
finds time, whether on furlough or not, to
travel and visit friends. He writes an article
for the Charleston (S.C.) Courier (Oct.8);
orders the election of three new lieutenants
(Oct.9); mentions Gov. Pickens as promising him
an appointment in the artillery (0Oct.25);
mentions the appointment of his brother, Frank

 

W. Capers, as a Brig. Gen. in the Ga. Militia;
mentions fighting elsewhere and the Mason-
Slidell affair; decides to resign his position
at The Citadel (Nov. 29); and mentions the
Charleston fire(Dec. 13). Other subjects men-
tioned include a ened Davis,

 
Capers, Ellison 12
C.S. gens. T. F. Drayton, and 8.S. Ripley,
Federal prisoners, and the C.S. steamers, Clinch
and Seabrook. Units mentioned include
Beauregard Light Inf. (Co.E, 25th Regt. of S.C.
Inf. Vols.); 4th Brig. of S.C. Militia; lst,
16th, and 17th Regts. of S.C. Rifles; and

Col. Orr's Regt. of Mountaineers (Orr's Rifles
or lst Regt. of S.C. Rifles).

In a letter of June 8, 1862, to his wife,
Capers speaks of a skirmish with the 7th Regt.
of Conn. Inf. and the capture of a man from the
latter. (More about this matter appears in

several items of oO 1905). He writes on

 

 
Capers, Ellison 13
Aug. 8, 1864, from Macon, Ga., discussing over-
crowded trains. He writes from Atlanta on the
19th about a close escape from death when a
large shell fragment fell through his tent.
C.S, Gen. Joseph Wheeler, Jr. (1836-1906), it
is hoped, will break up the railway, so that
U.S. Gen. W. T. Sherman's Army of the Tenn.
must fight or retreat by Sept. 1. If the
FederalS fight, they must assault the Confederate
lines, only to be repulsed. On the 20th Capers
reports to his wife that the U.S. has disrupted
the C.S. railway to Macon. He mentions C.S.
Gen. States Rights “oe letter is written

 

 
Capers, Ellison 14
on the back of an order mentioning iron-clad gun
boats.

Capers writes to his wife on Aug. 2, 1862,
that while the Southern newspapers criticize
the sober C.S. President Jefferson Davis, they
are quiet about the reckless use of liquor by
major and brig. gens. commanding important
divs. and brigs. Some gens. imperiled the
sacred cause before Hichmond by being totally
intoxicated. The Charleston (S.C.) Mercury is
owned by Robert Barnwell Khett, Sr., who has
been disappointed in his ambition of receiving

office in the C.S.A. Se” Yeadon, of the

 

 
Capers, Ellison

 

Charleston (S.C.) Courier, is ferocious against
the City Council, because it denied militia
preferment to two men. It is all a cheat and a
lie, exclaims Capers, that Rhett and Yeadon
shoubd pretend to be acting from unselfish
motives. Whereupon, Capers discourses upon
religion and produces a poem,"After warfare,
rest is pleasant," followed by more discourse
upon religion and another original poem,"“Who
the cause of Christ would yield." The next day
his letter has another original poem, "Oh,

to Grace, how great a debtor."

 
Capers, Ellison 16

On the 8th Capers believes that the North
fights from pride and revenge, and that this
will continue to influence that section while
Abraham Lincoln reigns.

Ale prices are discussed on Dec. 9.

C.S, Gen. Clement Hoffman Stevens is mens:
tioned a number of times. On Dec. 23, 1862,
for example, he is highly praised.

Stevens was Col. of the 24th Regt. of S.C.
Inf. Vols. in which Capers was a lt. col.
Stevens resigned as col. on Dec. 27, 1862, in
a letter to the C.S. Adj. Gen., Gen. Samuel
Cooper (1798-1876). g

 

 
Capers, Ellison 17

Capers resigned as lt. col. the next day in
a letter to C.S. Gen. States Rights Gist, and
in another letter of the same date offers an
explanation of his action.

On Jan.|9, 1863, Capers writes to his wife
about Gist, Federal troops in N.C., rumors, and
the Marion Rifles (Co.A., 24th Regt. of S.C.
Inf. Vols.). See letter of the 22nd which
tells more about the war on the N.C. coast and
mentions C,.S. Gen. William Henry Chase Whiting
in a P.S. of the following day.

On the 30th is an interesting note on C.S.

Army camp life.

 

 
Capers, Ellison 18

The next day has stirring news of the de-
fense of Charleston Harbor.

On Feb. 24, 1863, Capers discusses a Negro
Slave who brought back espionage information to
the Confederates about a planned Union attack
upon Charleston and Savannah. The Negro was
imprisoned for a month by the Federals. C.S.
Gen. P.G.T, Beauregard is discussed. U.S.

Gen. Rufus Saxton is said to command a Negro
brig.

General Wm. Stephen Walker is praised on
the 26th. C.S. Gen. Roswell Sabine Hipley is
described (See also ‘6 of the 28th).

 

 
Capers, Ellison

Beauregard, though a genius, is too ambitious
and vain for Capers. Political men swerve him
from the path of duty. Robert Barnwell Rhett,
Sr., induced him to disapprove the court-martial
findings in the case of Major Alfred Rhett, who
killed one Calhoun in a duel. Beauregard said
that the Article of War against dueling was a

 

dead letter, and that men of honor in the South
fought duels. (See L.A. White, Robert Barnwell
Rhett _11931]) C.S. Gen. R.E. Lee is praised.
On Mar.1 Lincoln is mentioned. A letter
of Feb. 9 (to which a letter of Mar.l1 is
attached) is by a “6 the Jeff Davis

 
Capers, Ellison 20
Artillery in D.H. Hill's Div. C. S. gens.
Micah Jenkins and Evander McIvor Law are
discussed.

Capers writes on Sept. 3 and 4 about the
Chattanooga Campaign and draws a map of the
surrounding area. He discusses the strategy
and the topography in some detail and mentions

 

U.S. gens. U.S. Grant and William Starke Rose-
crans. The subject is continued on the 6th and
on subsequent days. D.H. Hill, S.R. Gist, Bragg
John Austin Wharton, and Joseph Wheeler,Jr. are
mentioned. Hardee's Corps and an extended
Giscussion of the C.S. Soldier's religious life

 
Capers, Ellison
(and lack of it) are discussed.

Stevens has a fine discussion of the
Chattanooga Campaign on Nov. 28, 1863.

Capers has some verse on Apr. 24, 1864.

On Aug. 11, 1864 Capers discusses his own
outfit, the 24th Regt. of S8.C. Inf. Vols., dis-
cussess the Atlanta Campaign,includes a diagram,
and discusses Wheeler's movements. Wheeler's
operations on the rear of U.S. Gen. W.T.Sherman's
forces are discussed on the 19th. On the 20th
Capers reports that enemy raiders have again
disrupted Confederate communications on the

Macon Railroad. This i is written on the

 

 
Capers, Ellison ez
back of orders, dated June 13, 1864, and dealing

with C.S. Navy ironclad gunboats, to Beauregard
from the Asst. C.S. Army Adj. Gen.

On Sept. 4, after the fall of Atlanta,
Capers incorrectly predicts that Sherman will
rest his Army of Tenn. and send Grant reenforce-
ments for the Richmond Campaign.

 

In a fragmentary letter, written on the
back of an order of Sept. 25, 1864, Capers
mentions the death of Gen. David Flavel Jamison.
The order is a circular from C.S. Gen. Walter
Joseph Hardee,

Capers' letter “oe 14 is notable for

 
Capers, Ellison 23
its description of Florence, Ala., and its
representatives of that peculiar Dixie insti-
tution, the Southern belle. The Confederate
troops,with much spirit, crossed the Tenn. River
on a single pontoon bridge, while the bands
played their liveliest airs. Not much damage
had been done to the town by Union troops, ex-

 

cept for the burning of about 12 homes. Several
of the surviving residences are elegant. Capers
proposed three cheers for the ladies, many of
whom were pretty. Gen. John Calvin Brown, then
commanding Capers' division, sent for Capers,
who rode up and found @ General and Gen.

 
Capers, Ellison 24
S.R.Gist talking with a very beautiful woman, a
Miss Foster, the belle of Florence, who had
asked to be introduced to the officer who had
Proposed the cheers. Capers describes her be-
witching mannerisms and appearance, but while
conceding her loveliness and accomplishments,
doubts that she has much heart and launches into

 

a discussion of the allegedly undesirable traits
of belles in general. He continues with remarks
upon the fine clothing of the Florence ladies,
though two-thirds of them are in mourning. He
describes in detail the clothing of a small

boy accompanying his | mother..

 
Capers, Ellison 25
Capers writes to his wife from Charleston
on Sept. 10, 1865, giving a brief description
of conditions there. The Negroes "behave
admirably" in view of the circumstances. The
city is overstocked with Northern goods and
all sorts of Northern merchants around. Capers
sees no prospect of entering business there,

 

since struggling Charleston merchants and clerks
take up every opening. Some of Capers' friends
are urging him to become a lawyer, but he can

"still here the voice of the Spirit, & my heart

is in another work."

 
Capers, Ellison 26

The Moffettsville, 5.C., Academy on Aug.
12, 1870, invites Capers to address the school.
The veterans of Co. F, 24th Regt. of S.C. Inf.
Vols., will generally be present.

Some post-bellum letters discuss Civil War
campaigns. J. H. Steinmeyer, Jr. writes on
Nov. 9, 1877, about the Chattanooga Campaign.
His letter of Mar. 16, 1880, deals more with
the Atlanta Campaign and the death of C©.S. Gen.
William Henry Talbot Walker.

A clipping from The Sunday News, Charleston,
S.C., Jan. 16, 1881, contains some notes of
May-July, 1863, from a “" by a member of Gen.

 

 

S.R.Gist's staff abou the fighting around

 
Capers, Ellison ii:
Charleston, including the Battle of Secession-
ville. Capers' combat effectiveness is dis-
cussed. Gen. Samuel Cooper, the C.S.Adj.Gen.,
made a visit. (See card 27a.)

Attached to Steinmeyer's letter of Aug.13,
1885, is his account of his old outfit, the
Marion Rifles (Co. A, 24th Regt. of S.C. Inf.
Vols.)

Wade Hampton Gibbes writes on Aug.4, 1877,
to Capers about a soon to be vacant pastorship
in a Columbia, S.C., church. Some later items
deal with the same subject. William Barnwell

 

 
Capers, Ellison 27a

 

James Davis Porter, President of the Nash-
ville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railway Com-
pany and former governor of Tennessee, writes to
Capers on Feb. 12 and 28, 1883, about the Battle
of Franklin (1864) and former C. S. generals
Benjamin Franklin Cheatham and Fitzhugh Lee.

A letter of Mar. 28, 1885, and a newspaper
clipping of about that date discuss the death
of Dr. Matthew W. Abney of Edgefield, S. C,

 
Capers, Ellison 28
(1862- ), Acting Secretary of the Episcopal
Tririty Church, of Columbia, S.C., on Sept. 1l,
1887, records the church's unanimous desire to
call Capers to the pastorate. Gibbes writes to
Capers on the 12th and 13th;and Milledge Luke
Bonham, on Oct. 4.
Dr, Waller Hunn Nardin, Sr. (1837-1908),

 

M,D.,a prominent physician of Anderson,S.C.,

and former Asst. Surgeon of the 24th Regt. of
S.C. Inf. Vols. writes on July 2, 1895 to Capers
(by then Episcopal Bishop of S.C.), inviting

him to address the survivors of Co. F.of the

24th Regt.

 
 

Capers, Ellison 29
: Stephen Dill Lee, President of Miss. A.

and M. College and a former Confederate pen.,
writes to the Bishop on July 14, 1896. T.
William Mecklenburg Polk, M.D., is mentioned.
Former C.S. Gen. Samuel Gibbs French writes
several times to Capers. On July::21, 1896, he
discusses the Battle of Allatoona (1864); the
pine tree on Allatoona Mountain (later converteé
into battle souvenirs); and the message "Hold
the fort: for I am coming," which became the
basis for P.P. Bliss' revival hymn. See R.S.
Henry, The Story of the Confederacy (1931),p.42

 

 
Capers, &llison 30
On Feb. 20, 1901, French mentions Zachary
Taylor and his (French's) writings on the Mex-
ican War and the Civil War. He declares on
July 3 that his publishers, slow and timid,
“asked of me a considerable toning down of
truthful expressions to which I consented."
The subject is continued on the 8th. Capers'

 

note,attached to the last, states that French is
right in denouncing Sherman's brutality.
A newspaper clipping of June 5 contains the
roll of Co. G, 24th Regt. of S.C. Inf. Vols.
Several letters of 1904 and newspaper
clippings of 1904-1905 discuss the story of

 
Capers, Ellison as
Cpl. Milton M. Woodford of Hartford, Conn., 7th
Regt. of Conn. Inf. Vols., who was captured in
June, 1862,by Capers during a skirmish on James
Island, S.C. The Hartford, Conn., Daily
Courant for Dec. 8, 1904, contains Bishop
Capers' letter of Dec. 2 to the Rev. Dr.Chauncey
Bunce Brewster, Episcopal Bishop of Conn., who
later became a "bishop" of the Baptist Church.
A U.S. Army veteran, the Rev. L.S. Johnson,
gives his reminiscences of his Civil War exper-
iences with Woodford and others, in a letter of
Dec. 9 to a newspaper, presumably the Courant.
He discusses U.S. Lt. Ss Llater Gen. ]

Joseph Roswell Hawley.

Another Union veteran, Col. Jacob L.
Greene (1837-1905), President of the Conn.
Mutual Life Insurance Company, writes to Capers
on the 10th.

Brewster writes on the following day to a
son of Cpl. Woodford.

"Bishop" Johnson has more reminiscences
in his letter of the 13th to Capers.

The Courant on Jan. 25, 1905, says that
Capers has returned Cpl. Woodford's rifle to
the Woodford family, and has letters by Capers

and Johnson.
