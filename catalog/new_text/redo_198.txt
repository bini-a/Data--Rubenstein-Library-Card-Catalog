The volume is the Ledger, 1749-1796 (157 pp.
from a tavern. The sales to customers were
mostly of rum and other liquor, but occasion-
ally other commodities, notably sugar, were alsa
sold. There are no entries for room and board,

so the establishment was not an inn. In colon-
ial days most taverns in Rowan County were in
private homes (James S. Brawley, The Rowan

Story, p. 56).

 
Lowrance, Alexander & John Pre

This ledger was formerly attributed to John
Dickey, but it appears that he was not the own-
er.. There are some accounts for him as a cus-
tomer,

Alexander Lowrance was the owner, at least
during the earlier years. In the ledger there
is a list entitled “Bonds Bills & Notes Due to

 

Alexander Lowrance at February 6th 1755." On
another page there is the text of an oath taken
on Sept. 18, 1755, in which Alexander Lowrance
swore that all the accounts within the book were
correct. The justice of the peace before whom
the oath was made was eo County, that

 
Lowrance, Alexander & John

Tocation suggesting Maryland with which the John
Dickey account book also has a connection. How-
ever, place names within the accounts are in
North Carolina. The volume was found in the old
William Cowan home between Cleveland and Mt.

in western Rowan County (see statement filed with
John Dickey's account book). It is possible that
the pre-1755 accounts are from Maryland, but most
of the volume, and quite possibly all of it, con-
cerns business in North Carolina. On another
page there is a note "April 4, 1757 Memorandum

 

 
Lowrance, Alexander & John _ 4
that James Bartron paid me Taxt money to me
Alexander Lowrance."' There is no Alexander
Lowrance in the 1790 census of North Carolina,
but a number of Lowrances were listed, all of
them either in Rowan or adjacent Iredell County.
Presumably Alexander Lowrance died before the
1790 census, and someone else owned the tavern

 

during part of the period covered by this
ledger. Since Dickey was listed as a customer
in the later years, it is unlikely that he was
an owner. Names of various customers can be

 
*Lowrance, Alexander & John 5

 

ound in the 1790 census for Rowan, Lredell,
and other counties,

John Lowrance was probably the later owner,
or one of them. A note of Jan. 9, 1791, found
inside the ledger is a request for whiskey to
be sent to two customers, James Young and
Christopher Irvin (or Gwin), and their note is
addressed to John Lowrance.

The items are financial and legal notes that
were found inside the volume. Two of the notes
are directed to or for John Lowrance.

LUCAS, Edward and William. Letters. 1821-1868.
Charlestown, Virginia. 138 pieces. Sketch.

Edward Lucas (1780-1858) was born near Shep-
herdstown, Jefferson Co., Va. (now W. Va.). He
graduated from Dickinson College in 1809. After
serving in the War of 1812 he studied law, was
admitted to the bar, and practiced until 1818.

He then became a merchant. Lucas was a member
of the Va. House of Delegates in 1819-1822 and
again in 1830. A staunch supporter of the Demo-
Cratic party, he served in Congress from 1833 to
1837. He then returned to business and was also
superintendent of the armory at Harpers' Fer
from 1847 until his Qe in 1858.

 
 

LUCAS, Edward and William Sketch (2)
His brother, William (1800-18%7) was graduat-

ed from Tucker Law School, Winchester, Va., in
1885. In 1830 he moved to Charlestown where he
practiced law. He was elected to the Va. Legis-
lature in 1839 and served in Congress 1839-1841
and 1843-1845. He was a delegate to the Va. Con
vention of 1850-51 and shared his brother's faitt

in the Democratic party.

The collection contains the letters and pape
of Edward and William Lucas, and because of the
importance of the two brothers 19 state and na-
tional politics, the letters are valuable. There
are some interesting eo” on the leading

 
in 1833. Edward Lucas, a loyal Democratic sup-
porter, expressed a firm belief in state rights,
but opposed Calhoun's policy of Nullification.
The removal of the bank deposits caused heated
discussion from all sides. One of the most in-

teresting letters is from William Lucas, in °>%
which he expressed complete disapproval of Henry
Clay; disappointment in Jackson, arising mainly
from the Force Bill which he considered the exer
cise of arbitrary power, and faith in Calhoun,
albhough his neistent Qe rete to Lucas,were

at times 1n°Onsistent The letter is undated,

 
LUCAS, Edward and William. Sketch. (4)
but it was probably written early in 1834. The
collection also contains the usual routine poli-
tical correspondence.

William Lucas's son,Daniel Bedinger,was educa
ted at the University of Va. and in law at Wash-
ington College,and began his law practice in
Charlestown in 1858. He served on the staff of

 

Henry A.Wise during the Civil War and resmmed
the practice of law in Charlestown in 1867. He
served in the State legislature, 1885-86, and in
1887 was appointed to the U.8.Senate by the gov-
ernor. The COllection contains several letters

 
 

LUCAS, Edward and William. Sketch, (5)

from Daniel, written while he was a student at
the University of Va., in which he told of his
studies, his professors, etc. They are in no
way exceptional, but shed some light of the Uni-
versity of Va. in 1850.

Alice (Houston) Luiggi (1886-1963), an author,
was the daughter of a Southern father and a New
England mother. A native of Kansas, she re-
ceived a B.A. degree in journalism from the
University of Kansas in 1911. Mrs. Luiggi's

husband, Mario L. Luiggi, whom she married in
1921, was employed as a sales agent of General
Motors in various countries. His father had

been an outstanding engineer and senator in

 
Luiggi, Alice (Houston) 2

 

Italy. e in Argentina with her husband,
Mrs. Luiggi gathered information concerning the
approximately 70 graduates of American normal
schools who were invited by the Argentine
government to teach in that country from 1870
to ca. 1888. Mrs. Luiggi died in 1963, and her
husband died later, probably in 1964. A year

later Mrs. Luiggi's book on these teachers,
65 Valiants, was published by the press of the
University of Florida. In a letter of November

11, 1951 (Hill Folder), Mrs. Luiggi noted that

 
Luiggi, Alice (Houston) 3
some of the preliminary chapters of her book
would be published in the Hispanic American
Historical Review.
e bulk of the material in the collection
falls in the period 1948-1952, consisting
primarily of letters to various sources inquiring
about each of the teachers, and of notes taken
in interviews and from other sources about the
educators, There are some items dated in the
1870's and 1880's which are copies of letters

of the teachers, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento,

 

 

 
 

Luiggi, Alice (Houston) a
and Mary Tyler (Peabody) Mann, which Mrs. Luiggi
made in the process of doing her research.
There is an individual folder for each teacher,
arranged alphabetically.

There is a great deal of biographical infor-
mation on the teachers, and data concerning
public schools, normal schools, teachers, and

salaries in Argentina in the 1870's and 1880's.
Argentina had had a very poor educational sy-
stem, particularly under the dictatorship of

Juan Manuel de Rosas. When Sarmiento was the

 
Luiggi, Alice (Houston) nat 5
Argentine minister to the U. S., he was im-
pressed by the American educational system.
When he became president of Argentina in 1868,
he arranged to bring the American teachers to
his country to open normal schools and model
grade schools in the newly-established free
public school system. These teachers founded
schools in such towns as Mendoza, Catamarca,
Cordoba, La Plata, Buenos Aires, and others.

In a letter of February 7, 1949 (Kimball Folder),

a list of teachers and their schools is given.

 

 
 

wth, Alice (Houston) Mase 6
Kindergartens in Boston, St. Louis, and

Washington, D. C.; Domingo Faustino Sarmiento;
and Mary Tyler (Peabody) Mann are important
subjects covered in this collection. Mrs. Mann
interviewed many of the teachers hired by
Sarmiento. There is also much information on
Argentina and various families, such as the

 

Armstrong, Atkinson, Eccleston, and Stearns
families. The diary of Sarah Eccleston, 1883-
1886 (Eccleston Folder), describes the voyage to

Argentina and the hardships and customs in that

 
Luiggi, Alice (Houston)

country.
Mrs. Luiggi was able to gather pictures of

most of the teachers, Also included in the
collection are pictures of Mrs. Mann and Sar-
miento, and photographs of busts of Horace Mann

and Abraham Lincoln.

subscription; one receipt from the Orange and
Alexandria Railroad Company for transportation
from Alexandria to Warrenton; and a receipt
for the purchase of food for the 4th regiment
of the Virginia Cavalry. It includes two legal
documents, one a warrant for the apprehension
of a Negro slave who is accused of stealing and
the other a deed for the purchase of a three
and a half year old Negro boy.

In addition there are six letters, all but
one dating from the Civil War period. One from

 

 
Luttrell Family

J. B. Sitton, Postmaster in Pendleton, South
Carolina, is written to another postmaster re-
garding the location of his sick son. His son
was a private in the Palmetto Sharpshooters. It
is a touching letter as the father explains how
anxious he is to find him and to make sure he
gets the best available medical attention.

 

In a letter dated March 1, 1863, a Union
soldier stationed at Camp Napoleon on Saint
Helena Island, South Carolina, writes that he
has "eight months pay" coming to him. He also

 
Luttrell Family s
describes how interested he is to get mail and
to look at the papers, particularly their ad-
vertisements.

Another letter attacks the Copperheads' be-
liefs about the War. In an undated letter from
J. T. Ewell of the 9th Virginia Cavalry to
"Mr. Luttrell," Ewell explains that although he

 

paid the amount requested by him for hay that
the government price is cheaper and that he
hopes Luttrell will be willing to accept that
price instead. In an undated letter, a dispute

 
Luttrell Family 5
involving the selling of slaves is discussed.

Lyman, Joseph. Papers. Boston, Suffolk County,
Massachusetts

 

The collection contains thirty-five items,
most of them letters relating to the abolutionist
newspaper the Commonwealth, founded and pub-
lished in Boston by Joseph Lyman. Very little
was found in reference sources about either

 

Lyman or the Commonwealth. A search of the
Boston city directories lists Lyman as a coun-
sellor in 1843 and 1844. However, he is un-
listed in the 1850-51 and 1855 directories.

 

 
Lyman, Joseph 2

 

Through items in the collection, one learns the
Commonwealth was both a daily and weekly pub-
lication and that it had been published several
years prior to 1851. Most of the letters are
from newspaper editors and from contributors and
subscribers of the Commonwealth. Many contain
complaints about not having received the Common-
wealth in the manner desired, changes of
addresses, and requests to receive the Common-
wealth in exchange for their own publications.
Among the correspondents are: James

 

 

 
Lyman, Joseph 3

 

Gillespie Birney, abolitionist and legislator;
Cyrus Moses Burleigh, editor of the Pennsylvania
Freeman (ca. 1851); Edward W. Cobb, editor of
the Inq Inquirer; John D. Defrees, editor of the
Indiana State Journal; George Washington Julian,
abolutionist and congressman to the United States
House of Representatives, 1849-51 and 1861-71

 

 

from Indiana; James Miller McKim, clergyman and
abolitionist, editor of the Pennsylvania Freeman
(ca. 1840); George S. Raymond, editor of the

Northern Light; George Snell, architect; Francis

 

 

 
Lyman, Joseph 4
Henry Underwood, author and diplomat; and Samuel
Hurd Walley, lawyer and congressman to the United
States House of Representatives, 1853-55 from
Massachusetts.

Through two of the items one is able to learn
about the strong feelings abolitionists held
against slavery. Writing on Aug. 9, 1851, Samue
Aaron said he trusts that Massachusetts has set
an example for the rest of the Union for her be-
lief in abolition. He speaks against Daniel
Webster, who while stating he believed slavery
was evil, nonetheless thought it was not so

 

 
Lyman, Joseph
great an evil as "disunion."” In his March 7,
1850, speech, Webster declared himself for Clay's
compromise on slavery and stated that Northerners
had not lived up to their obligation to return
fugitive slaves. To strong antislavery men
Webster was a "fallen star." Aaron wrote, "No
public want during my life has gratified me more
than that mental and moral evolution in Massa-
chusetts that has freed that noble state fromthe
enthralling fascination of Webster's great but
corrupted intellect."

In an essay written Aug. 28, 1851 publication

 

 
Lyman, Joseph 6

 

 

his unhappiness over the Buffalo Platform that
had been adopted at the Free Soil Party national
convention in 1848. The platform had said in
part, "No more slave states and no more slave
territory." Wellen's belief was that as long as
one man anywhere in the Union could be held in

Slavery all could be. He said trying to control
slavery by not letting it spread any further was
like trying to "stop the willow from growing by
cutting off its branches." He said he believed
the writ of habeas corpus should be enforced in

 
Lyman, Joseph 7

 

all the Southern states. His argument was that
since the Southern staes had adopted both the
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution
"they had agreed that every person had a right
to the privilege of that writ; that is the right
to his life, liberty, pursuit of happiness ...
or in other words the right to his liberty under
the common law." He was particularly scornful
of South Carolina for wanting fugitive slaves re-
turned to the state. The essay is written on
stationery containing information about and the
bylaws of the Lake Rock Granite Company formed

 
Lyman, Joseph
in Lynnfield, Mass. on July 26, 1849.

Another item, a speech made by John Hooker
Ashmun (1800-1833), concerns the attributes of
the republican form of government. Ashmun, who
graduated from Harvard in 1818, was appointed as
the first professor in Harvard's Law Department

 

upon its establishment. He also established a
law school in Northhampton, Massachusetts.

Another item, also undated, is a notice from
C. F. Bamartt to the Commonwealth about a meeting
to be held at the Pine St. Church in Boston.

 

 
Lyman, Joseph

Its stated purpose is to subdivide Boston's
South End into limited sections for the purpose
of more effectively caring for its poor. At the
head of the notice are the words "Systematic
Relief."

Lemuel Lynch succeeded William Huntington

was twice mayor of Hillsborough, 1845-1849 and

The ledger is identified with Lynch by the

labeling on the front flyleaf and spine. The
entries in the accounts are dated, 1860-1881.
An index of names is at the front of the
volume. Lynch itemized his sales and repair

work so that the entries record the possession

of jewelry, timepieces, and other items by
many local persons.

The ledger is the third of a series of
ledgers. Lynch often began accounts in this
volume with the notation, "To Amount from Book

‘Book A" (p. 48).

Among the miscellaneous papers found within
the volume there was one page of an account
between Lynch and John W. Norwood, 1840-1846,

Durham, Durham Co., N.C.

 

George Leonidas Lyon (1881-1916) was a world
champion marksman in the sport of trapshooting.
He was also an early automobile enthusiast, a
hunter, and for some years the police and fire
commissioner of Durham, N.C. The Durham city

directory of 1903/04 listed Lyon as anelectrical
contractor and automobile manufacturer and as
secretary of Lambe & Lyon, a men's clothing
store. He was the son of Robert E. Lyon and Mary

 
Lyon, George Leonidas (1881-1916)

 

Elizabeth (Duke) Lyon and the grandson of
Washington Duke. In 1900 Lyon married Anne
Snowden Carr, daughter of Lewis Albert Carr, a
prominent Durham businessman, and Clara (Watts)
Carr, sister of George Washington Watts, a
leading Durham businessman and philanthropist.
Her father was from Baltimore and was not

initially related to the Durham family of
Julian Shakespeare Carr. Her mother's people,
the Watts family, were also from Maryland some
of whom also became prominent Durham citizens.

 
Lyon, George Leonidas (1881-1916)

 

Lyon had a stellar career in trapshooting
competition as an amateur. Sporting Life de-
scribed him as "one of the greatest trap shooters
that ever stepped to the firing line." Fora
time he was a professional in the East and South
and was a representative of the Remington Arms-
Union Metallic Cartridge Co. and of E. I. Du
Pont de Nemours & Co. In 1912 Lyon was a member
of the coaching staff of the U.S. team that won
team and individual championships at the Olympic
Games in Stockholm, Sweden. He was a member of

 

 
Lyon, George Leonidas (1881-1916)

the New York Athletic Club that, after his
death, honored him with the establishment of

the George L. Lyon Memorial Cup for amateur
competition. As a hunter he was a member of the
Quail Roost Gun Club when that game preserve
near Durham was popular with sportsmen from both
North and South. He was a very popular sports-

 

man and was known affectionately as "Bull" and
"Chief Bull Durham." Lyon died at age 34 of
tuberculosis in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where
he had gone to restore his health. His wife died

 
Lyon, George Leonidas (1881-1916) 5
a few years earlier. The Lyons were survived by
three children: Clara Elizabeth Lyon (b. 1901)
who married Roland Prince McClamroch; George
Leonidas Lyon, Jr. (b. 1904); and Mary Duke (Lyon)
Newcombe (b. 1913). There are many descendants.
The collection consists of correspondence
(95 items, 1911-1917), pictures (106 items, ca.

 

1870's - 1915), clippings (55 items, ca. 1908-
1915), and miscellany (5 items, 1926 & n. d.).
An Oversize Folder includes both pictures and

clippings.

 
Lyon, George Leonidas (1881-1916)

The collection primarily concerns the life of
George Leonidas Lyon, especially his career in
sports as a champion marksman. Most of the
letters and clippings relate to his sporting
career and final illness and death. The photo-
graphs represent not only Lyon and his immediate

 

family but also other family members of the same,
preceding, and subsequent generations, including
members of the Duke, Watts, Carr, Lyon, and
McClamroch families.

There are more than ninety letters during

 
Lyon, George Leonidas (1881-1916)

1911-1917 most of which are from 1915-1916.
Many of these letters are attached in groups to
scrapbook sheets so that the arrangement is not
chronological. A few letters are written by
Lyon, but most are addressed to him and to his
friends and relatives. Many letters and tele-
grams concern his final illness and death. Other
letters, however, are about his career as a
marksman or reveal something about it. The
correspondents include employees of gun and
ammunition manufacturers, especially the

 

 
Lyon, George Leonidas (1881-1916) 8
Remington Arms-Union Metallic Cartridge Co. and
E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. that include
references to their involvement in the sport of
shooting. There is a statement about Lyon's
career and also a letter of 1911 in which he
lists some of his history. There are two letters

 

of 1915 from John Philip Sousa who was a friend;
both have interesting letterheads.

The clippings, ca. 1908-1916, are filed in
both the Clippings Folder and the Oversize Folder
They are mostly articles about his career as a

 
Lyon, George Leonidas (1881-1916) 9

 

marksman and his illness and death. There are a
few references to Quail Roost. Lyon's nicknames
of "Bull," "Chief Bull Durham." etc. appear in
both the clippings and the letters.

The pictures are almost entirely photographs.
They include as arranged: George L. Lyon (10);
Anne Snowden (Carr) Lyon (9); George L. Lyon, b.

1904 (1); Edwin Buchanan Lyon residence (2);
Clara Elizabeth (Lyon) McClamroch (14); Washing-
ton Duke (2) and James B. Duke (1); Lewis Albert
Carr (1); Gerard Snowden Watts (1) and Anne

Elizabeth (Wolvington) Watts (1); Zebulon B.

Lyon, George Leonidas (1881-1916) 10

 

(22); Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church
Parsonage (2); unidentified (4); and those filed
in the Oversize Folder (32). These photographs
are of both individuals and groups.

George L. Lyon's photographs include several
early automobiles. He is reputed (George
Lougee's article in the Information Folder) to
have owned the first automobile in Durham. A
Durham newspaper reported in 1901 (ca. Oct. 31)
that he had a car. Most of these automobiles
are in scenes photographed in Durham. The
miscellaneous pictures include an advertising

 
Lyon, George Leonidas (1881-1916)

 

photograph of a Premier sedan. Many of the
photographs of Lyon are in the Oversize Folder
where they are attached to scrapbook sheets.
They include: individual photos of Lyon with
and without guns; scenes from this shooting
competitions, including his championship contests

with Lester S. German and others; hunting group
scenes, possibly in N.C. (Quail Roost?); his
boat at Morehead City; judges at the 1912
Olympic Games; and scenes on an ocean liner (trip

to the Olympics?).

includes a highly unusual street light sus-
pended over the intersection.

Twenty-two photographs in the Lake Toxaway
Folder are views of Toxaway Inn, its guests,
and environs. The original Toxaway Inn, built

in 1901, was a popular resort for the wealthy
until the lake, formed in 1903, was destroyed
by a flood in 1916. The Inn had many notable
guests including members of the Duke family.

James B. Duke met his wife there. Three per-
sons have been identified: Sarah Pearson

Mary (Duke) Biddle; and George L. Lyon. The
photographs are undated. They date sometime
between the construction of the lake in 1903
and 1915 (Lyon died in Jan., 1916). There are

letters in the B. N. Duke Papers from Mrs.

Duke, Mary Duke, and Angier B. Duke in 1908 and

1911 written on stationery of the Toxaway Inn.

William Henry Lyttelton, First Baron Lyttel-
ton (1724-1808), was M. P. for Bewdley,
1748-1755 and 1774-1776, governor of South
Carolina, 1755-1762, governor of Jamaica,
1762-1766, ambassador to Portugal, 1766-1771,

and a commissioner of the treasury, 1776-1782.
A letter book contains copies of Lord

Lyttelton's outgoing correspondence from

February 18, 1763, to March 31, 1766, when he

 
Lyttelton, William Henry, lst Baron Lyttelton 2
was governor of Jamaica. Seventy letters are
included. This volume was his personal, not his
official, letter book. Governmental affairs
were mentioned or discussed at various times,
especially in the series addressed to Lovell
Stanhope and to Stephen Fuller. Stanhope was
agent for Jamaica, 1757-1763, and undersecretary
of state, 1764-1765. He was succeeded as agent
by Fuller. The controversy surrounding the
appointment of a new agent appears in the
correspondence, Commercial, military, and

 

 
Lyttelton, William Henry, lst Baron Lyttelton 3
naval affairs were noted occasionally.

There were some brief remarks about political
matters in South Carolina and considerably more
about trade in the letters addressed to John
Hume, storekeeper of the ordnance there. Hume
handled various transactions for Lyttelton,
especially the shipment of garden seeds for
which North America was considered the best
source,

Many letters were addressed to merchants and
bankers in England, notably Messrs. Long &

 

 
Lyttelton, William Henry, lst Baron Lyttelton 4
Drake Hoare & Co. (bankers), and Chambers,
Hiccox, & Chambers. Various kinds of goods,
household furniture, and clothes were ordered,
and these communications provide some indication
of the manner and style of the colonial gover-
nor's life. Many transactions were also chan-
eled through William Richardson of the Coffer-

 

er's Office. Lyttelton's financial affairs
appear in considerable detail, including the
arrangements with his brother, George, Lord
Lyttelton.

A large collection of the papers of Lord

 
Lyttelton, William Henry, lst Baron Lyttelton 5
Lyttelton was included in a sale at Sotheby's

in 1978. A copy of the sale catalog, The
Lyttelton Papers, is filed with the letter book,
and another copy is available in the book

stacks of Perkins Library.

The papers of Dr. Bernard Lytton-Bernard are
concerned with his long friendship with Francis
Warrington Dawson II, who lived in Versailles,
France. Beginning when they were young men,
the correspondence describes their mutual in-
terest in health, in Dawson's writings, and in
the Fresh Air Art Society. Both men were in
London before World War I when Dr. Lytton-
Bernard was known as Bernhard Trappschuh.
Warrington Dawson's health became the center of

 
Lytton-Bernard, Bernard 2

 

interest in his letters. By January, 1915, he
stopped all journalistic work, although he con-
tinued to write novels and articles, some of
which were published by Bernard Lytton-Bernard.
About 1922, Dr. Lytton-Bernard went to the
United States, settling in Chicago where he
continued producing publications about physical

culture. In the last letter, written by
Dawson in 1960, he was still writing about
symptoms of his ill health, revealing that Dr.
Lytton-Bernard had given him a special diet.
The work in physical culture was transferred

 
Lytton-Bernard, Bernard
from Chicago to Guadalajara, Mexico, where Dr.
Lytton-Bernard conducted a health spa.

The letters of Dawson to Lytton-Bernard are
valuable for the details they reveal of Dawson's
life during World War I.

The collection contains the business papers
and family correspondence of Robert C. Mabrey.
Mabréy was a farmer and merchant of Ridgeway,
N.C. There are a number of insurance policies,
indentures, copies of wills, and general
business correspondence. The letters of 1870's
show something of the difficulties following
the war. Those of a later period are those of

Mabréy and Son, successors to Read and Mabrey,

MABRY, Robert C. ___Sketch. (2)
general merchants.

The bulk of the family correspondence is that
of Helen Mabry, a student at Greensboro Female
College, 1895-96, with her father, her brothers,
Walter and William, and her sister, Pattie. The
letters reveal something of student life. Later
Helen taught school. There are several letters

 

 

of Alice U.Goodman, a teacher in Louisa Co.,Va.,
whom Robert C. Mabry married in 1887. They shed
some light on the life of the school teacher of

1887, The value of the collection is that it

reveals a great deal about social and economic
conditions from 1870 2 1900.

These business and legal papers begin
with Wm. Stephens Matthew McAllister, a
descendant of Archibald McAllister, who entered
Pa. in 1730. Matthew was appointed district

 

attorney for the southern district of Georgia
by George Washington. He married Hannah
Gibbons, the daughter of Joseph Gibbons, Sr.,
of Savannah, Whose name, with hig,appears on

a Georgta Land Company salel. 795, to Thos.

Yazoo Land frauds as one of the directors of
the Georgia Company. He signed as district at-
torney the grand jury judgment against Thos.
Skrine for an attack on the post of St. Nicolas
on the River St. John in East Florida. The

 

grand jury of Sefferson County, with John
Berrien, foreman, presented a ‘petition to
Judge Matthew McAllister in the Oct. term of
court, 1801, in which reforms in the voting
laws and in the criminal code are endorsed,

between his widow, Louisa, and his sister

to refer the division of Richard's estate.

Although this set was accessioned as the
"Ellen McAlpin Collection," the name is mis-
leading, since the bulk of the material con-
sists of letters to Mrs. Laurad. (Bulloch)
Locke. She was the wife of Major Joseph L.
Locke, who in 1862 was chief of subsistence,
and in 1864 chief purchasing agent for

the state of ““o-5“~ there

 
McAlpin, Ellen Sketch (2)
seem to be no letters from him, the only Civ-
11 War missives being one from an unidentified
but extremely uneducated person.

In 1853 Mr. and Mrs. Locke and their
smal] daughter, Florence, went to Grafenburg,
Germany, to live. They later moved to Italy.
During their absence from America, Mrs.

 

Locke's mother, sister, and brother, who was
a minister, were faithful correspondents.

Unfortunately, however, they chose very thin
stationary which is now cfumbling rapidly in

spite of mending. x ) ink and poor hand-

 
McAlpin, Ellen Sketch (3)
writing added to this render them practical-
ly illegible. Amon} the few that can be
deciphered is one from a friend in Venice
(dated: June 3, 1856). It gives an unusually
good picture of that city. There are occa-
sional references to the progress of the

Civil War, in the family letters from Savan-
nah.

 

The first letter containing any reference
to the McAlpins occurs May 13, 1872, and there -

“y

after they occur more frequently. It was im-

possible to discover

a) the relationship

 
McAlpin, Ellen Sketch (4)
between Mrs. Locke and Ellen McAlpin, but it
seems to have been only one of friendship.
Most of the letters to Miss McAlpin are
from her younger sister Georgia, who was
teaching school in Saint Paul, Minnesota.
With the exception of the Civil War let=
ter of Oct. 28, 1863, and the letter already
mentioned from Venice, these are largely
family and personal letters. The fact that
in some places the correspondence is rather
unrelated renders the whole even less valu-

able. fe

James Wallace McAlpin was a rice farmer in
Savannah, Georgia, and of Scottish descent.
His parents, Helen McInnes and Henry McAlpin,
immigrated to the United States in 1804, and
moved to Georgia in 1812. James W. McAlpin

married Maria ("Ria") Sophia Champion, and
they had five children: James W., Jr.; Daisy
Schley; Mary E.; A. Champion; and Henry, Jr.

He became a judge of the court of the ordinary
of Chatham County, Georgia.

 
McAlpin, James Wallace 2
The majority of the correspondence falls in
the 1880's, and deals with family matters.
Most of the letters were written by Maria to
her husband while she was visiting one or
more of her children, and a few to her father,
Aaron Champion. Other letters were written by
the children, primarily Henry and James, to
their father. Included also are a few finan-
cial papers, a newspaper clipping about General
Frederick Townsend, and a brief undated family
tree for James and Maria McAlpin.

Melchor Rafael de Macanaz (1670-1760),
Spanish statesman and author, achieved
prominence during the reign of Philip V. He was
secretary to the King during the War of the

Spanish Succession. As president of the Consejo
de Hacienda he accomplished radical reforms.

His bibliography of historical and political
works is extensive. Some of them can be

found in the Duke University Library.

 
Macanaz, Melchor Rafael de ro

 

The manuscript is a copy of a political
work ascribed to Macanaz. Its title, “Auxilios
para bien governar una Monarquia," appears on
page one in the first paragraph of a letter
addressed to Philip V. Macanaz's name and the
dating of Aug. 20, 1722, at Paris are at the

end of the letter (p.12). Macanaz lived at
Paris after 1715. Don Antonio Valladares de
Sotomayor published the work in 1788 as part
of his Semanario Erudito and in 1789 as a

separate volume with a title longer than that
of the manuscript. “6 the Auxilios are

 

 
Macanaz, Melchor Rafael de 3
apocryphal according to Don Joaquin Maldonado
Macanaz. He thought that the Auxilios were part
of the attack on the Jesuits during the reign of
Charles III. See pages lix-lx of his introduc-
tion to Melchor de Macanaz's Regalfas de los
Sefiores Reyes de Aragon (Madrid, 1879).

 

 

The work purports to date from 1722, but the
date of the manuscript is uncertain. Presumably
it is a copy, an estimate suggested by the pre-
sence of more that one style of handwriting.

Major General Arthur MacArthur (1845-1912),
Commander of the VIII Corps, was appointed Mili-
tary Governor of the Division of the Philippines
on May 5, 1900, when William Howard Taft and the
five-member Philippine Commission were expected

to arrive to restore civilian government after
the Spanish-American War and the Filipino revolt
President Taft of the Commission and General
MacArthur of the U. S. Army worked in 1900 to
restore order. This letter book is composed

 
MacArthur, Arthur 2

of copies of the official correspondence of
MacArthur from August to October, 1900, in re-
gard to the Insular Government. Thoroughly
indexed, the typed copies contain detailed in-
formation on many phases of the transition

from military to civilian government. The lette
book does not reveal the struggle between Taft

 

and MacArthur except in letters in the first
part of October, 1900..

Phases of administration touched on begin
with commissary affairs, customs, Internal
Revenue, currency, budgets, banking, courts,

 
MacArthur, Arthur ‘.

 

and affairs in the city of Manila. On p. 17
the question of Spanish claims for war mater-
jals and the setting up of a Spanish Board of
Liquidation are mentioned.

A list of towns organized under General
Orders M 40 is given;. pp. 38-66. A Forestry
Bureau and postal service were functioning.

The communications between Taft and MacAr-
thur are listed. Much of MacArthur's corres-
pondence is handled by Lt. Col. Enoch Herbert
Crowder, his military secretary, while A. W.
Fergusson is secretary of the U. S. Philippine

Commission.

 
MacArthur, Arthur 4
Military personnel of many U. S. regular army
units are involved in the correspondence as
serving in governmental capacities. Samuel
Baldwin Marks Young, John Biddle, Chief of
Engineers, Frank Wheaton, Stephen Crosby Mills,
Inspector General, William Edward Horton
and Crosby Parke Miller of the Quartermaster

 

Corps, Frank Taylor in charge of Insurgent
Records, and James Franklin Bell, the Provost
Marshal of Manila, are correspondents.

sanitation, markets, custom house construction,
bridges and highways, and the reorganization of
the auditing department concern Taft and Mac-
Arthur. The commission held the financial
power (p. 188) and gradually took over the
power held by the military. The Taft-MacArthur
letters of Oct. 8, 9, 10, and 12. (pp. 196-198

 

and pp. 204-211) give a glimpse of the conflict

Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney.
Papers, 1779-1798. London, England.

 

George Macartney, First Earl Macartney (1737-
1806), was a British diplomat and colonial
governor. He served as ambassador extraordinary
to Russia (1764-1767), chief secretary for
Ireland (1769-1772), captain general and

governor of the Caribbee Islands (1775-1779),
governor and président of Ft. St. George, Madras
(1780-1786), ambassador to China (1792-1794),
and governor of the Cape of Good Hope

(1796-1798).

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 2

Macartney was governor of the Caribbee Island
when John Byron, commander of the fleet in the
West Indies, wrote to him from St. Lucia on
March 30, 1779. Byron discussed prisoner
exchange with the Americans at Martinique, and
he reported the presence of Admiral D'Estaing's
fleet at Ft. Royal Road.

In the fall of 1781 George Proctor was
appointed a member of the commission for the
Carnatic finances see C. Collin Davies, The
Private Corresnondence of Lord Macartney

 

 

 

Governor of Madras (1781-85) (London, 1950),p.2.

rr

 

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 3
On Dec. 13, 1751, Proctor wrote a long letter
to Macartney in which he discussed revenue
administration.

In India Sir Andrew Mitchell wrote two letterg
of January 11 and May 10, 1785, from Bombay and
commented upon the disposition of the naval
squadron under his command. On January 11 he
noted his recent marriage.

General Sir James Henry Craig preceded
Macartney as the chief British official at the
Cape of Good Hope, Craig then went to India,
and he wrote to Macartney from Madras on August
22, 1797. He or } preparations for

 

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 4
the expedition against Manila in the Philippine
Islands, and he commented on the disposition of
Tipu Sultan and his army in Mysore. The exped-
ition to the Philippines was later cancelled.
On November 8, 1797, Sir Alured Clarke, com-
mander-in-chief of Bengal, congratulated
Macartney on his appointment as governor at the

 

Cape of Good Hope. Clarke commented on anxiety
about the accession of Vizir Ali as Nabob of
Oudh and concern about a possible attack on
Hindustan by Zemaun Shah. He noted Sir James

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney aa
Craig's departure for the upper stations that
he was to command.

On July 29, 1798, John Pringle, commissary
general and agent for the East India Company,
wrote from Simon's Town near Cape Town and
discussed the difficulty in manning the Recovery
for a voyage to St. Helena.

 

On July 30, 1798, John Holland, postmaster
general at the Cape, responded to charges
against him by Sir Hugh, probably Sir Hugh
Christian, second in command of the fleet. The

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 6

 

controversy involved the handling of prize
Ships. One of Holland's duties was judging
prizes according to Lady Anne Barnard, South
Africa a Century Ago (Cape Town, 1913), p. 148.
8 items added, 6-8-65.
On Oct. 10, 1795, Mr. Plumb, a missionary
in China, wrote to Lord Macartney. Macartney's

 

name is not on the letter, but the notation of
its receipt (p. 4) is like those on two other
letters received by him in the same year (June
29 and Dec., 1796). Plumb wrote from Shansi

Province about his work there,

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney

On June 29, 1796, Henry Baring wrote to Lord
Macartney from the East India Company's factory
at Canton and Macao. He commented upon: the
elevation of Mr. Hall as chief of the factory;
the disgrace of the Tsontou Chantagin, a Chinese
high official, because of his handling of the
insurrection in Fukien; the reception of the
company's presents by the local ruler and by
the Emperor; and the results of attempts to
market paper and sword blades.

In Dec., 1796, Robert Udny recommended
Alexander Walker, a veteran of several voyages
to India, who wanted Ce a business at

 

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney fe)

 

the Cape of Good Hope. Walker was later employed
in the civil government at the Cape, according
to the Records of the Cape Colony, II, 333.

On Nov. 2, 1797, Col. William Pullarton
wrote about Capt. Hogan's attempt to establish
an agency at the Cape of Good Hope (probably
Michael Hogan, Capetown merchant), Gillan's

 

ill health, the war with France, and the defense
of Ireland against a French attack.

In July, 1793, the British warship L'Oiseau
seized the trading vessel Angelique at Penang
here it had anchored while en route from Madras
to Manilla. The =e and its cargo were

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 9
taken to the Cape, and several officials demanded
that it be sent to England for litigation. The
owners of the ship were Armenian merchants
resident at Madras. On Oct. 16, 1798, six of the
merchants appealed to Lord Macartney, reviewed
the history of the case, and asked that their
Ship be allowed to remain at the Cape until the
case was settled. On the same day Macartney
replied that he had no authority to act in their
case.

On Nov. 5, 1798, Arend de Waal, Receiver Gen-

at the Cape, reviewed his service to the
British, renewed his “6 for an increase in

 

 

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 10
salary, and asked about his rank.

Also in Nov., 1798, Willem Stephanus van
Ryneveld, Fiscal at the Cape, reported to
Governor Macartney on the relative authority
of the government and the Burgher Senate for the
water and drainage systems at Cape Town. The
cost of new lead drainage pipes was the stimulus
for the study.

Records from Macartney's governorship at the
Cape have been published in Cape of Good Hope,
Records of the Cape Colony.

15 items added, 10-12-65. These fifteen
manuscripts, 1780-1796, are bills and receipts
for the purchase of goods and services by
Lord and Lady Macartney.

3 items added, 11-9-65. On Aug. 13, 1792,
Macartney acknowledged receipt of a paper from
Mr. Pennant, apparently the famous naturalist,
and noted the forthcoming travels in China.

On March 9, 1796, Sir George Leonard Staunton
discussed the Chinese viceroy at Canton, a map
of Marco Polo's travels in the ducal nvalace at

 

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 12
Venice, and the French and German translations
ef his account of the embassy to China.
Later on July 25, 1796, James Cobb, clerk
ef the East India House and dramatist, solicited
Macartney's approval of his handling of the
China correspondence and his recommendation for
appointment to manage the correspondence from
the governorship of the Cape of Good Hope.
1 item added, 12-23-66. One of Macartney's
policies as Governor of Madras was the strict
subordination of the military to the civil

 

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 13
power. This policy brought him into conflict
with the military command, a controversy that
is described in W. Greene's letter (11 pp.) of
Oct. 1, 1783. The addressee is unidentified
but was either a relative or friend of the
Townshend family, according to the last sentence
Army officers discussed were: Sir Eyre Coote;
James Stuart; Sir John Burgoyne, Seventh
Baronet; and Lt. Col. Ross Lang. Paul Benfield,
a wealthy merchant, was also noted.

2 items added, 1-23-67. On Jan. 21, 1797,
Dr. Hugh Gillan introduced Mr, and Mrs. Strombo

 

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 14

 

of the Cape Colony.

On Sept. 12, 1797, John Hudleston, later a
member of Parliament and a director of the East
India Company, discussed his campaign to become
a director, the hostility of Henry Dundas, and
the refusal of the Court of Directors to grant
the government an interest-free loan of two

millions sterling. He also recommended Thomas
Keate who had obtained a writership at Bombay
through the assistance of his uncle, Dr. Thomas
Keate of Chelsea Hospital.

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney a5
110 items added, 3-1-67. Macartney arrived
at Madras in June, 1781, to assume his duties
as governor and president. The war with France
had encouraged Hyder Ali of Mysore and the
Mahrattas to attack the British in India, and
conflict raged throughout the peninsula. Late
in 1780 Britain declared war on the Netherlands,

 

and the Dutch possessions in India and Ceylon
became involved, The British naval commander-
in-chief in Asia was Sir Edward Hughes, whose
letters to Macartney during 1781-1784 comprise
most of this addition to the collection. The

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 16
correspondence begins in June, 1781, and is
extensive for the last six months of the year.
There are numerous, but less frequent, letters
for 1782 and 1783, and only a few items for
1784, There are occasional cammunications from
other civil, military, or naval authorities in
the. three presidencies. Naval operations are
emphasized, but there is also considerable in-
formation about various armies, especially in
southern India, since Hughes cooperated with
them in some important battles. The corres-
pondence covers the last three years of the war

 

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 17
for peace was made with the Mahrattas in 1782,
the French in 1783, and Mysore in 1784,

In July, 1781, Hughes was at Porto Novo when
General Sir Eyre Coote defeated an army of
Hyder Ali. During August to December the fleet
sat off the Dutch settlement of Negapatam that
was captured in November after the arrival of
land forces, Plans were then developed to
attack the Dutch at Trincomali, Ceylon. There
is considerable information on military oper-
ations in the south, especially those of Sir
John Brathwaite and Eccles Nixon. Sir Eyre

 

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 18
Coote was active in the north, and there are
some reports on his operations until his death
in 1783. Governor General Warren Hastings
occasionally appears in the correspondence of
1781-1783. Macartney was anxious to conclude
peace with his Indian antagonists, a policy in
which Hughes concurred. Indeed, the Admiral
blamed the British for the breach of the First
Treaty of Poonah (letter of Sept. 21).

Early in 1782 Hughes captured Trincomali,
but it was soon lost to a strong French fleet
commanded by Admiral de Suffren. In addition

 

 
Macartney, George, First Earl Macartney 19

 

to the usual military and naval news, the
correspondence is notable for accounts of the
sea battles on April 12, July 6, and September
3.

During the early part of 1783 the squadron
was at Bombay, but it returned to the east
coast and joined the army in an assault on the
French at Cuddalore in June. Accounts of the
naval battle include a list of both fleets,

The correspondence concludes with a few

manuscripts of 1784,

3 items added, 3-11-70: Three letters
(April 4, 24, 1798) of Alexander Davison, a
prominent government contractor, concerned the
shipment to Macartney of stores and merchandise
valued at more than £50,000. Two of the letters
were addressed to William Huskisson, Under
Secretary for War and the Colonies, and were
copies sent to Macartney.

Zachary Macaulay (1768-1838), British
philanthropist, was an important figure in
the movement to abolish the slave trade and
slavery.

On Dec. 14, 1812, Macaulay wrote to a Capt.

Close and strongly recommended Robert Grant,
barrister, for his advocate. He remarked that
Grant was "new in the cause" and that he and
his brother Charles Grant were to attend a

Andrew Jay McBride of Fayetteville, Ga.,
entered the Confederate Army as a member of the
"Benjamin Infantry," 10th Georgia Regiment, in
1861, arriving at Camp Fairfield, near Richmond,

 

Va., by June 8. His regiment (later a part of
Longstreet's I Corps) was sent after three
weeks to Camp McLaws at Williamsburg, Va., to
oppose Union forces. Young McBride began
writing to Mary Frances Johnson (Cousin Fannie)
whom he later persuaded to become his wife.

 
McBride, Andrew Jay 2
A few letters are to a sister.

He gives a brief. glimpse of the mobilization
of his unit and of Williamsburg in war time.
Most of his letters are love epistles or full
of sentiment conéerning his marriage in 1864.

On Aug. 25, 1861, he tells of camp life, of

 

rejoicing over the Confederate victory at

lst Bullftin, of fighting at Hampton, Va., and
of a visit to the battlefield at Bethel, Va.

On Sept. 29, 1863, he is transferred with Long-
street's command to Eastern Tennessee. Here he
briefly describes the fighting around Russell-

 
McBride, Andrew Jay 3
ville. But on Jan. 9, 1864, he writes a fine
letter to Fannie describing the hardships of
the common soldier and giving a vivid account
of his reactions during the assault on Fort
London at Knoxville. (See McLaws and Poe
Papers in the Duke MSS. Department).

 

Details are lacking until the Battle of
the Wilderness, when he is wounded. He des=
cribes the general blood and carnage as well as

McBride, Andrew Jay 4
captain, relates fearful northern losses. , On
June 5, he is in a Richmond hospital, Promwhich
he was transferred to Andersonville, Ga. From
there. he comes to recuperate at Macon and

West Point, Ga. By mid-July Sherman's raiders
are in this section.

 

He is in Jonesboro, Fannie's home, on July
28, when he describes the bustle of war acti-
vity there. On Aug. 4, he is captured in
Fayetteville, his home, by Federal troops, but
is released on parole. From Vineville he write
on Sept. 5 to describe the Battle of Jonesboro

 
McBride, Andrew Jay 5
and the condition of the town; which the Union
troops almost demolish.

Fannie finally marries Andrew McBride at the
end of October, 1864. He is sufficiently re-
covered to return to Virginia to fight, but
Sherman's march through Georgia holds him in

 

Macon. Finally Gen. D. H. Hill appoints him
to command in February, 1865, of a "Camp of
Direction" in Augusta, where he acted as a
colonel. He sends officers and men to their
commands. Meanwhile, young McBride begins
business ventures. Here he notes high commo-

 
McBride, Andrew Jay 6
dity prices. In March he notes troop movements
the arming of Negroes for military service,
and the busy and gay life at Augusta. Echoes
of Sherman's March through Georgia are scatter-
ed from September, 1864, to March, 1865.

Andrew McBride had hoped to become colonel

 

of the 10th Georgia. He probably never recei-
ved this appointment. War ended and he return-
ed to his wife and his business ventures. Al-
though educated and an able writer, he rarely
expressed strong reactions to war or to the
Confederacy. No sorrow at its fall is evident.

He finallysettled in Atlanta in the crockery
business as McBride and Co. A series of

and McBride families of Georgia conclude the

These volumes contain the plantation jour-:
nals and some accounts of Dugal McCall of Clai-
borne County, Mississippi, and of his son
Duncan McCall of Tensas County, Louisiana. In
1850 Dugal McCall had a small.’ but valuable

farm on which he produced primarily corn. This
tarm was located near the town ot Rodney (across
the line in Jetferson County) and also adjacent
or near Oakland College which is now the site
of Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College.

 
McCall, Duncan and Dugal Z Z
Oakland College was mentioned often. Duncan
McCall had a large plantation across the Missis-
sippi River in Tensas County, Louisiana, on
which he raised considerable cotton and corn.
The two men visited and dealt with each other
often. These volumes were originally cataloged
as belonging only to Duncan and as being located

 

only in Mississippi. The farms of both men
have been located in the agriculture schedules
of the 1850 census, and Dugal is also listed in
Claiborne County in the 1830 census. The
Louisiana agriculture schedule is available in

 
McCall, Duncan and Dugal
the Manuscript Department.

 

Dugal McCall's journal is in two parts.
The first volume contains his journal entries
of March 1, 1850, to Dec. 25, 1851, and a
variety of financial accounts dating during
1832-1854. The second volume contains the
journal entries for Jan. 6, 1852, to Jan. 1,
1854, plus a second version of Jan. 1-7, 1851.

Duncan McCall's journal dates from June 1,
1852, to Jan. 7, 185 This volume also con-
tains many lists of ~é¢ with records associ-

 
McCall, Duncan and Dugal “ &
ated with their work and upkeep. The Miscel-
lany also contains a list of slaves with their
dates of birth.

The journals are an excellent record of
daily activities. They include information on:
plantation activities; Oakland College; cutting
and selling of wood, sometimes to steamboats;

 

sawmill operations; friends and neighbors; the

weather; brickmaking; the tasks of slaves;

building slave houses; smokehouses; local

Methodist churches attended by Dugal McCall in
e

Claiborne and Jefferson counties; Baptist

churches attended by Duncan McCall in both Lou-

planting fruit trees; occasional sale of such
products as turnips, corn, hides, and potatoes;
hog killings; cultivation, ginning, and pres-
sing of cotton; elections and voting of the
Whig ticket; frequent trips to Natchez usually
by boat; a visit to a New Orleans commission
merchant to arrange for further credit; and
references to the planting of ''Pomegranate

Cotton" (April 12, 1853) and the scraping or

Gamewell, Caldwell Co., N. C,

 

Rebecca Mariah Oxford was born in 1833, the
daughter of Isaac Oxford who appears to have
been a Baptist minister in North Carolina. Her
papers consist mainly of letters to her and her
parents from her brothers William C., James,

and Sion Harrington Oxford during their military
service with the Confederate Army. The majority
of the letters are from Sion Oxford who was in
the 22nd Regiment of North Carolina Infantry

 
McCall, Rebecca Mariah (Oxford). 2
and saw action in North Carolina and Virginia.

William C. Oxford's letters concern the war in

Tennessee.

In 1889, Rebecca Oxford married Jacob Monroe
McCall. Few papers, however, concern McCall
and little is known of him other than that he
apparently was a widower with children.

 

When the McCall papers were recataloged, a
ledger previously cataloged under the name of
A. B. Oxford was transferred to this collection.
It appears that A. B. Oxford was related to

 
McCall, Rebecca Mariah (Oxford) mM |
Isaac Oxford.

These papers were originally cataloged as the
Rebecca M, Oxford MSS. and were renamed when
additional information was discovered.

357 items added, 12-17-62: Correspondence,
legal and financial papers, and miscellaneous
items relating to Rebecca M. 0. McCall and
other members of her family. Many of the
jtems concern the Anderson family, especially
Leland Anderson of Lenoir, N. C. It appears
that Rebecca McCall may have married an Anderso

 

 
McCall, Rebecca Mariah (Oxford) 4
but this implication cannot be verified.

The papers included in this addition concern
family matters. There are several deeds and
indentures among the legal papers, and many
items concern the settlement of an estate,
possibly that of Rebecca McCall.

McCalla, John M. Papers, :
Payette Co,, Ky., and Washington, D.C,

The John M. McCalla Papers are those of a
lawyer, Democratic politician, and brigadier
general of Kentucky militia. He was the son of
Dr. Andrew J. and Martha (More) McCalla,
pioneers of Jessamine County, near Lexington,
Ky., where he was born,* prebablyabout—biesese .
Dr. Andrew McCalla was appointed in 1794 to
the first Board of Trustees of Kentucky Academy,
later Transylvania University, and there he
helped to found the Fayette Hospital, later the
Eastern Lunatic Asylum. The controversial

McCalla, John M.

 

Presbyterian minister, William Latta McCalla
(1788-1859), was also the son of Dr. McCalla.
John and William attended Transylvania College
in Lexington. After his graduation in 1810
John [More?] McCalla became an able lawyer and
political debater in Lexington, where his house
stood on Mill Street, opposite the college lawn.
He had sons, Dr. John M,McCalla, Jr., ard
Andrew J. McCalla, and Thomas M‘Callag and three daughters.
Young John M. McCalla joined the Lexington
Light Artillery Co. in 1812 and found himself
part of the Fifth Regiment of Kentucky Volunteer

 
McCalla, John M, 3
Militia. He marched under Col. Wm. Lewis to the
northern frontier after General Hull's defeat. The
Kentucky troops were sent to the relief of beseiged
Frenchtown on River Raisin, Michigan, where they
underwent massacre and imprisonment when General James
Winchester surrendered on Jan. 22, 1813.. The writings
include drafts, ca. 1813, of two articles by him in
defense of the Kentucky troops and in condemnation

of generals Hull and Winchester. There is a letter
from Gen. Jn. [?] Mason, announcing McCalla's ex-

change as a prisoner on

 

 
McCalla, John M, 4
July 30, 1814. A special folder of militia
rosters, accounts, and court-martial papers in
1812 shows Capt. McCalla serving as an adjutant
in the 5th Regiment. By 1817 he was a major of
the 42nd Kentucky Volunteer Militia, and shortly
thereafter became a brigadier general. Names
of many officers and men in the Kentucky militia
during the War of 1812 are contained in the
papers.

The letters of General McCalla are political
and legal in character. He was an ardent
Democrat who was called an infamous Loco Foco

 

 
McCalla, John M, 5

 

(radical Democrat) in 1848 and was welcomed to
the American Party in 18564. He was a political
opponent of Henry Clay and a supporter of Andrew
Jackson, Duff Green writes in 1829 to Congress-
man Thomas Patrick Moore of the conduct of
Clay's sons. McCalla's services were rewarded
ca. 1829 with the U. %, Marshallship for the
District of Kentucky, an office which is
reflected in his bills, receipts, and legal
papers till 1847! His letters contain refer-
ences to settlement of estates, pension claims,
and legal practice. The Presidential election of

 
McCalla, John M, 6
1844 involves correspondence on William Jordan
Graves, Robert Augustine Thompson, and James
Watson Webb. A fight in the U. S. House of
Respresentatives between John White of Ky. and
George Oscar Rathbun of New York is noted on
Apr. 25, 1844, by Henry Smith Lane. McCalla was

 

in the thick of this campaign, speaking and being
accused of dispersing money for William Orlando
Butler in his fight with William Owsley for the
Ky. governorship.

Qn March 31, 1845, McCalla became the 2nd au<
ditor in the Treasury : of Jas. K. Polks

administration. His correspondence contains a
number of letters of Kentuckians seeking
Democratic plums through McCalla's influence.
Robert Breckinridge McAfee, Thomas Patrick
Moore, John Pope, Lewis Cass, and Charles J.
Helm are among the correspondents whose letters
mention Henry Clay, the Whig Party,James Buchan-
an, Polk's Secretary of State, De ocratic polit-
ical patronage, and Thomas Ritchie, editor of
the Democratic Union. John H. Wheeler of Beatty-
ford, Catawba Co., N.C., writes to McCalla afte
a visit to Washington in 1845. Wheeler was
evidently a Democrat oe of a government

position. His historical sketches of N.C. were
published in 1851.

McCalla sold his Kentucky property in 1846.
His career was spent in Washington in legal
practice from that time. His second auditor's
office handled the business of,the U.S.Army
during the Mexican War. PierceRButler of &.C.,
Wm. O. Butler, Thos. Marshall,John Tibbatts,John
White Stevenson, and John Hunt Morgan are
correspondents. William O. Butler and the Ky.
forces under General Wool are defended by Mc-
Calla in a newspaper article, after accusations

 

 
McCalla, John M, 9
arise over the fighting at Saltillo and Monter=
rey, Mexico. Generals Winfield Scott and
Zachary Taylor are mentioned. Wm. 0. Butler was
wounded and comes back to Ky. His letters on
the Mexican War at this time are notable.

A.K. Marshall writes a series of letters to
McCalla. The election of 1848 brought the name
of W.0. Butter into prominence as a vice-
presidential candidate. McCalla became involved
in the publication of a letter by John J.
Crittenden on Henry Clay which seems to have
been forged. Crittenden*is accused of by-
passing Clay for a”

 

 
MeCalla, John M, 10
John H. Wheeler on May 31, 1848, writes of
election biographies of Lewis Cass and W.0.
Butler. Linn Boyd, A.K. Marshall, and John
Minor Botts write on the campaign. With Taylor's
election General McCalla left the Treasury
Department to enter privaté law practice in
Washington. Wm. O. Butler writes in 1851 on his

 

candidacy for the Presidency. There are details
on the second auditor's office as McCalla
gathers material for charges against his suc-
cessor, Philip Clayton. With Franklin Pierce in
office, McCalla again sought governmental

 
McCalla, John M,
appointment.

In 1854 he evidently transacted legal busi-
ness for John Cabell Breckinridge. By 185& he
is the ally of Thos. Hart Clay of Ky. in the
American Party. McCalla became interested in
the work of the Ky. inventor, Thomas Harris
Barlow, whose letters, 1857to 1859, reveal a

 

government subsidy to perfect a rifled cannon,
a process with which the panic of 1858 inter-

The clippings of the collection are of a
political nature. Pierce Butler and Col. &.B.
Mason have a dispute as Cherokee Indian Com-
missioners. Among the miscellanea is an origina
poem by Wm. O. Butler on the Battle at River

and claims.
Correspondents include Lewis Cass and George

These papers belong principally to General John

M. McCalla of Lexington, Ky., and Washington,
D. C. As such they reflect the subjects treated

 

in the main papers.

Thomas Chase concerns the purchase of Spanish
land from the Commandant at Port of Quachita,
as evidently it could not be secured from

Baron de Bastrop, a large holder of lands.

Ninian Edwards of Bellevue, Illinois, writes
on May 12, 1827, for an opinion on a legal case,
meanwhile commenting on the rapid settlement
of Illinois. Gov. Fdwards was a Kentuckian
before he went to Illinois.

Brother William L. McCalla, a controversial
Presbyterian minister, writes from Philadelphia
in 1827, also mentioning many members of the
MeCalla family and the Ebenezer Presbytery
of Kentucky.

Robert Allen reports on taking the census

 

 
McCalla, John M 15
of 1830.

Former McCalla slaves, liberated and sent
to Liberia, write in 1834 and 1836 on condi-
tions in Monrovia, Liberia.

Charles Jared Ingersoll writes in June and
July, 1845, concerning data from General Mc-

 

Calla on his experiences in the War of 1812,
material which Ingersoll included in his his-
tory of that war.

Mexican War correspondents are Capt. George
Tobin, Co. D, Washington Regiment (lst Regiment,

 
MeCalla, John M. 16

 

Smith's Brigade) and John Hunt Morgan in search
of a commission in 1847.

The longest series of letters to General
McCalla are by Dr. William Whitty Hall
(1810-1876) during the 1840's and 1850's. Dr.
Hall was a Kentuckian who settled in New York
and edited Hall's Journal of Health, but his

 

correspondence concerns mainly claims for »bount
land for Capt. Jas. W. Sloan and Joshus Harper.
Dr. Hall included a letter from Stanley Gris-
wold from Cincinnati on Jan. 25, 1812.

By 1855 General McCalla, who was interested

 
MceCealla, John M. 17
in inventions, became involved in a portable
gas patent. Litigation and disputes occur
in the company, which includes John S. Gallaher,
Jr., of Shepherdstown, Va., and John W. Smith.
The business papers of the firm are included.

In 1860 Dr. John Moore McCalla, Jr. , (342-1897
enters the papers when he becomes agent for the

 

United States government in the return of Ne-
groes captured from a slaver. His interests
are described in detail in his journal.

The discharge of Thomas Locke Harrison
from the U. S. Navy is signed by Gideon Welles.

The letters of this addition conclude with
a small correspondence of Sally Page Andrews
of Fruit Hill Farm, Shepherdstown W. Va., and
Baltimore, Md. in 1915-1917.

‘John Moore McCalla, Jr., kept a journal
of a trip to Liberia in 1860 which concluded

with brief entries on Washington, D. C., in
1861. The McCallas were active members of the

1860 with the U. S. Sovernment to return to

from a slaver. The Negroes were brought into
Key West, Florida, where the Colonization
Society sent two ships, Star of the Union and
South Shore, to pick up the Negroes and trans-
port them to Liberia. Dr. McCalla was appointed
agent of the U. Ss government by Sec. of
Interior Jacob Thompson, and Dr. J. M. Grymes

 

 

 

was named surgeon for the Colonization Society.
Dr. McCalla started on June 13, 1860, from

New York by ship for Key West. He describes

the town while awaiting the departure of the

 
McCalla, John M. 20

 

Star of the Union (p. 15). The Negroes were
from the Wy Wydah tribe, whose customs are well
described by Dr. McCalla. After seasickness
and the death of a number of Negroes, the ship
arrived at Monrovia, Liberia, on Sept. 2, 1860,
where the South Shore also docked about the
same time. While part of the Negroes were

 

being landed at Monrovia, Dr. McCalla visited
the town and described its houses. de met
Judge Wilson and Dr. Joseph Jenkins Roberts

American Colonization Society, as well as

 
MeCalla, John M. yA

 

President Stephen A.Benson of Liberia and the
missionary, the Rev. Alfred F. Russell. Dr.
McCalla describes in detail a dinner at the
home of the distinguished Negro, the first
President of Liberia, Dr. Joseph Roberts, and
his wife, Jane (Waring) Roberts.

The Star of the Union sails to Greenville,
Sinoe County, Liberia, to land the last of the
Negroes. Krootown is described. Comment is
madé (p. 66) on the two Liberian political par-
ties, True Liberians and Whigs. Dr. McCalla
is interested in the native plants he finds and

 

 
McCalla, John M. 22

 

notes the ships which come and go frequently.
He begins his return voyage on Sept. 21, 1860,
stopping at Grand Turk and Salt Cay in the
West Indies to take on a cargo of salt.

This portion of the journal contains a clip
ping, Apr. 8, 1870, from the New York-Herald,
reporting the wretched conditions of life in

 

Liberia, the high death rate, and poor schools.
With no money and no employment many Negroes
reverted to barbarism.

From Jan. 1, 1861, to Sept. 14, 1861, Dr.

John McCalla kept a journal of his life in

 
McCalla, John M. 23

 

Washington, D. C. He obviously had medical
training, yet he takes employment as a clerk in
the Census Bureau on Jan. 14, 1861. Later

he has a position in the Surgeon General's Of-
fice. He knew a number of young men, part of
whom were doctors, with whom he talked, walked,
and played cards. He attended the commencement
of the Medical Department of Georgetown College

on Feb. 22, the supposition being that he had
attended this school as a student. Frequent
mention is made of visits to the Washington

Asylum (19th and B. Sts., S. E., whose inmates

 
McCalla, John M. 24
were residents of the poorhouse). Here Dr.
MceCalla knew Dr. James E. Morgan (1822-1893),
the head physician at the Asylum.

Dr. McCalla (pp. 155-156) describes
Lincoln's inauguration on March 4, 1861, when
the crowds number only one-half of those at
Buchanan's inauguration. Troops guard the route
of the procession. In rapid succession Dr.
McCalla mentions Major Anderson's surrender at
Fort Sumter, Virginia secession, the riotous
passage of troops through Baltimore, and the

arrival of troops in Washington, whose citizens

 

 
McCalla, John M. 25

 

are scattering. Food is scarce and high in
price. None of these entries is detailed.
Mrs. John McCalla, Sr., had died while her
son was in Africa. On May 1, 1861, Dr.
McCalla briefly reviews family history since
their removal from Lexington, Ky., in 1846.
By early summer encampments of troops are

mentioned. The most graphic passage is the
description of the first Battle at Bull Run
with its aftermath in Washington. Friends of
McCalla are captured and placed in Old Capitol
Prison. Another friend, Thomas Locke Harrison,

 
McCalla, John M. 26
from Martinsburg, Va., resigns from the U. S.
Navy and goes South.

In the midst of this confusion and tragedy,
Dr. McCalla maintains a light heart.

Three ledgers with the collection deal with
the estate of Dr. McCalla’*s wife, Helen Varnum

 

(Hill) McCalla. They were married ca. 1865.

The property involved is from estates of Jas.

M. Varnum (ad. 1821) and Silas N. Hill (d. 1860),
whose heirs are Helen VY. Hill and Mary Isabel
Hill for one part and Joseph B. Varnum on the

 
MeCalla, John M. 27
other. This estate, centered in Washington real
estate and securities, continued through the
life of Isabel (McCalla) Goldsborough and Helen
Hill Goldsborough. Interesting lists of
furnishings ca. 1865 are entered for Helen
(Hill) McCalla. See the genealogical chart with
the papers.

220 items and 17 vols. added, 4-14-65: The
letters in this addition to the McCalla papers
cover the years 1816-1871. On July 5, 1816,
William G. Hunt, editor of the Western Monitor,

 

 

 
McCalla, John M. Re 28

MeCalla‘'s conduct during the War. of 1812.

McCalla writes to Congressman Henry Clay, Dec
15, 1818, asking his assistance in gaining com-
pensation from the government.

 

On May 5 and Aug. 14, 1826, Dr. Christian
Boerstter, Funkstown, Maryland, advises Dr.
Andrew McCalla of the Eastern Lunatic Asylum in
Lexington, Ky., of his treatment for mental

 
McCalla, John M. _ ms 4
patients. Dr. McCalla had helped to found Fay-
ette Hospital which became the Eastern Lunatic
Asylum. William Latta McCalla writes to his
brother, John, on Feb. 5, 1828, regarding person
al difficulties.

Stephen F. Austin writes to McCalla on Oct.
29, 1828; they had been classmates at Transylvan
ia College in Kentucky. Austin reviews his
activities in Texas since 1821, and comments on
politics in both the United States and Mexico.

A letter of June 24, 1829, from Thomas P.

Moore, Kentucky Congressman, is critical of

 

 
 

McCalla, John M. ao
Henry Clay; Moore claims to have evidence of cor
ruption in the administration of Clay during his
term as Secretary of State. This is in response
to Clay’s complaints about the removal of Adams
appointees by President Andrew Jackson.

John McLean, Supreme Court Justice, on Feb.
16, 1830, congratulates McCalla on his appoint-
ment as U.S. Marshal, and comments on the Jack-
son 32dministration.

Beginning in 1828, and continuing into the
*50's, a personal correspondence develops be-

tween McCalla and Medard Coutre of Frenchtown,

 
McCalla, John M. 31
Monroe County, Michigan; both had participated
in the River Basin Campaign of 1812-1813.
Coutre has settled on the site of the battle of
Jan. 22, 1813, and is now raising a family.

A copy of a letter of Feb. 25, 1842, by
William Jordan Brooks to Henry Clay concerns the
duel of Brooks with Jonathan Cilley.

 

In 1843, McCalla is serving as legal agent
for Gabriel Moore, a former governor of Alabama.
Moore has suffered economic reverses, having
lost his estate, servants and livestock through

 
McCalla, John M. 32
the “treachery” of a nephew. The sale of his
thoroughbred horses is handled by McCalla.

The election of 1844 is referred to in letters
of that year. S.H. Laughlin of Nashville, ina
confidential letter, (Sept. 2, 1844) reveals his
knowledge of “gambling and immorality" by Henry
Clay in 1840. Laughlin wants this information
to be made public in order to damage Clay's repu
tation. A list of Democratic orders for Polk
in 1844 is filed here.

Other letters of 1844 and 1845 concern the

 

 
McCalla, John M. 33
contest between William Butler and William Owsley
for the governorship of Kentucky. McCalla was
involved.

Robert Wickliffe writes, on April 29, 1845,
that his son Robert, Jr. is being persecuted by
Whigs, who have tried to remove him from his
Ginlomatic post at Turenne, France.

 

News of the Mexican War is given to McCalla
by his friend, Theodore O'Hara, Quartermaster in
the brigade of General John A. Quitman. O'Hara
writes from Tampico and from near Vera Cruz

 
 

McCalla, John M. Ly
(November 16, 1846; March 3, 25, 1947). At
Chapultepec, O'Hara served on the staff of Gen.
Franklin Pierce. The Battle of Vera Cruz is
described on March 28, 1847.

Letters during the 1840's are personal and
legal, in addition to those dealing with McCalla’s
position as second auditor. Correspondents in-

clude A.K. Marshall and Samuel D. Ingham.

In 1853 President Franklin Pierce receives
letters from Theodore O'Hara, W.W. Stapp, Norvin
Green, and B.F. Johnson, all recommending that

 
McCalla, John M. 35
McCalla be re-appointed as second auditor.

On Nov. 7, 1860, John Wilson comments on the
election of Abraham Lincoln. Wilson with high
praise for Lincoln, hopes that he will take
forceful action against treason. A Whig, Wilson
commends McCalla for his earlier campaign against
those “enemies of liberty", the Jesuits, through

 

McCalla‘'s participation in the American Party.
Wilson, critical of Stephen Douglas whom he
claims joined the Catholic Church in 1853, re-
joices thet the “vengeance of Heaven” has fallen

 
McCalla, John M. 36
upon Douglas.

During the Civil War, McCalla, out of public
office, continues his law practice in Washington
D.C., dealing with claims against the U.S. gov-
ernment. He is agent for James C. Pickett, who
writes regarding his affairs, May 19, 1862, and
April 11, 1868.

An undated letter of McCalla, which he submits
for vublication in the Democratic Review, con-
cerns the political activities of members of the
Clergy. McCalla insists that such activities

 

 

are not consistent with their holy office.

 
McCalla, John M. 37

The letters which continue Until November of
1871, show that McCalla was active in his legal
profession until as late as his 78th year.
These last letters, all of a legal or personal
nature, include four more letters from James C.
Pickett.

Newspaper clippings pertain to temperance,
Presbyterian clergymen, and the Ladies’ Union
Benevolent Society.

Bills and receipts. begin in 1814 and cover
assorted years to 1870. Legal papers include

leases, contracts, indentures, and the bill of

 

 
MceCalla, John M. af 38
sale of "Kitty", a Negro woman. John McKee, in
an affidavit of Sept. 24, 1844, claims to have
seen Henry Clay drinking spirits and using pro-
fanity, in Richmond, Kentucky in the fall of
1841. <A copy of the will of Green Clay of Mad-
ison Co., Kentucky, was made for McCalla.
The remainder of the McCalla addition is made

 

up of volumes of his letterbooks containing
business and personal correspondence; 1830-
1868. (These letterbooks have been microfilmed
by the library of the University of West Virgigia@

 
McCalla, John M. 39
In addition to the letterbooks are ledgers con-
taining newspaper clippings (poetry, religion
and recipes); financial accounts; weather reports
(Jan. l-April 12, 1819); an index to assorted
cases in Congress (1850-51, 1855-56); and prop-
erty rental and construction (1812, 181921,
1858). A notebook of 1844 contains miscellaneous
notes on the Bank of the U.S., the Land Distri-
bution Bill, the tariff, Henry Clay (with refer
ences to his letters and speeches), the Texas
question, and the Whig-controlled 27th Congress.

 

 
MCCalla, John M. 40

From the 1830's through the '50's the letter-
books contain mostly business correspondence of
McCalla to various government officials, inclu-
ding President Andrew Jackson (Oct. 2 and 22,
1830). This relates to McCalla's duties as U.S.
Marshal of Kentucky, and later Second Auditor.
As Auditor, McCalla is concerned chiefly with

 

pension applications and claims for land from
veterans. From 1849 onwards, McCalls, removed
from appointive office, is acting as legal agent
for those with claims against the government. On

 
McCalla, John M. 41
Oct. ll, 1852, he comments on the presidential
election of that year, and on Nov. 12, 1852, he
criticizes Kentucky for having given its elector
al votes to Winfield Scott. McCalla favors a
U.S. guardianship over Mexico and Céntral America
to save them from anarchy.

In 1853, McCalla complains that he hasn't

 

enough clients to pay for his board. A letter
of Mar. 18, 1854, expresses bitterness against
President Franklin Pierce for having refused him
public employment. A year before, McCalla had

attempted to gain a position, either as Marshal

 
McCalla, John M. 42
of D.c. or ond Auditor, through the intervention
of W.O. Butler and John McLean. On April 25,
1854, McCalla denounces Pierce as "a stupendous
blunderer", without twenty friends in both Houses
of Congress.

Letters of October 3 and 28, 1854, reveal
McCalla's support of the New American Party
whose principles he supports. He continues to
denounce the administration and he accepts speak
ing engagements to help in the spread of the new
party. The deep feelings of McCalla in this

 

movement are evident, as he denounces "foreign

 
McCalla, John M. scl ae 43
papacy”, abolitionists, Jesuits, and “our ty+
rants." (Jan. 12, Apr. 20, July 10, 1855). He
writes (July 29, 1856) that he joined the
American Party soon after its organization, ser-
ving as president of the ward council and of the
chief council of the District of Columbia. On
July 8, 1856, he is concerned over supposed
"papal principles” of presidential candidate
John C. Fremont. Hopes for victory in '60
(through a Whig-Democratic combination) are dis-
cussed in a letter of Mar. 16, 1859.

On June 8, 1859, McCalla refers to "pecuniary

 

 
McCalla, John M. Ay
embarassments", due to his alleged persecution
as a member of the American Party.

By Sept. 10, 1860, he confesses his fear of
the consequences of the election of Abraham
Lincoln, and on Nov. 24, anticipates the dissolu
tion of the Union. November 24, 1860, finds

McCalla commenting bitterly on the abolitionists

 

and Irish, Dutch, and Negroes, who (he believes)
control Northern elections. On Dec. 16, 1860,
still critical of the "fanatics of the North",
he considers it strange "to overthrow the gov-

ernment for so slight a cause." McCalla himself

 
McCalla, John M. 45
is a “sincere friend of the Union", and on March
4 concedes that to preserve peace one must be
ready for war.

McCalla outlines his plan for avoiding a civi
war in a letter of Mar. 20, 1861. He criticizes
Kentucky (May 28, 1861) for not having served as
a mediator between North and South.

 

On Sept. 24, 1861, he criticizes General John
C. Fremont as extravagant and imcompetent. On
January 3, 1862, McCalla comments on the Mason
and Slidell affair as an opportunity for revenge

on the British for his own experience at River

 
McCalla, John M. 23 46
Raisin back in 1813. John McCalla, Jr. is work-
ing in the office of the Quartermaster General
and later in the Surgeon Generals Office. The
father writes to Edwin M. Stanton (Feb. 4, 1862)
regarding his son's position. In 1863 John, Jr.,
is assistant surgeon at the Seminary Military
Hospital in Georgetown.

Letters from McCalla throughout the war com-
ment on military campaigns and the political
situation. On Sept. 26, 1864, he remintsces on
"better days", before the “golden age" of poli-

 

tics was replaced by an “iron age".

 
McCalla, John M. 4?
On Mar. 9, 1665, MccCalla describes the second
inauguration of President Lincoln. The poor
performance of Andrew Johnson that day is also
mentioned. McCalla continues hbs contempt for
fanatics and disdain for Negroes. On Jan. 3,
1866, he confides that the North had committed
crimes against the South before the war. Sym-
pathy for the prostrated South is evident in
letters of 1866. He also becomes a partisan of
President Johnson. In an undated letter (ca.
Nov., 1866) he writes to the National Intelli-

 

 

gencer about alleged cruelties perpetrated upon

 
McCalla, John Me _ oe RS 48
the prisoners at Fort Jefferson, Dry Tortugas.
A falling out and reconciliation between
McCalla and James C. Pickett is revealed, Sept.

16, 1867.

McCalla‘s horror at the state of national
affairs continues into 1868.

The letterbooks end on March 3, 1868.

The 149 items and 2 vols., added 1-16-67,
chiefly concern the affairs of General John
Moore McCalla. These papers begin with a letter
of 1815 when McCalla went to Washington to buy

two pieces of artillery for Kentucky. He

 

 
MecCalla, John M. 49
describes the elation at the signing of a peace
treaty with Great Britain.

General McCalla was a Jeffersonian Democrat
and a supporter of Andrew Jackson. As early
as 1829 efforts were mady by his enemies, who
were the friends of Henry Clay, to discredit
him.

 

Beginning in 1842 McCalla writes to his wife
Maria and his son Andrew whenever he is in
Washington on business. Casual comment on
Congress, financial depression, local politics,
and claims fill the letters. Of unusual

 
McCalla, John M. 50
interest is the March 2, 1344, description of
the-explosion on the U.S.S. Princeton, the
casualties, and the state funerals that followed
He also discusses the romance of President
Tyler and Miss Julia Gardiner.

McCalla was a presidential elector-at-large
for the state of Kentucky, and he ardently

 

attacked Henry Clay and worked for Polk (see
clipping section). As a result of the personal
bitterness of this campaign, he left the First
Presbyterian Church in Lexington after a long

membership.

 
McCalla, John M. 5k
By Dec. 17, 1844, he was in Washington at
Gadsby's Hotel, and he wrote to his son Andrew
about the politicians gathered for the arrival

of President-elect Polk. Later that month he
wrote to Andrew about closing his Lexington law
office. On Jan. 10 and 15, 1845, he tells of
the Yancey-Clingman duel over the Democratic

 

Party's stand on Texas.

On Feb. 3, 1845, McCalla told Andrew of the
crisis in U.S foreign affairs over the annex-
ation of Texas and Oregon.

McCalla was appointed grand marshall for the

 
McCalla, John M, _ 52
inauguration of President Polk by the Democratic

associations: of'the District of Columbia. He
described the celebration at the annexation of
Texas on Feb. 28, 1845. On March 31, 1845
McCalla is appointed second auditor of the U. S.
Treasury and immediately moves his family to

 

Washington.
After his removal from office in 1849, McCalle

not only practiced law but was interested in
business ventures. A Kentuckian, John G. Tod,
writes from Galveston, Texas, on Nov. 29, 1851,
where he is in —— i Gail Borden devel-

 
MeCalla, John M. 53
oping a factory to manufacture meat biscuits.
This process had it source in pemmican, dried
meat used by the Western Indians. It was hoped
to secure government contracts for use of meat
biscuits by the Army and Navy.

As late as 1853 General McCalla was seeking
political appointment in Washington, but his
enemies blocked such employment.

In addition to social letters, the papers
also contain correspondence upon the removal of
the body of his daughter from Kentucky.

Legal papers include affidavits concerning

 

 
MeCalla, John M. 54
the shooting in 18529 of Thomas Benning, editor
of the Kentucky Gazette, by Charles Wickliffe.

Among the clippings, 1816-1855, are a
number reporting political disputes in which
McCalla was involved in Kentucky. The letter
he wrote about Henry Clay on May 24, 1844, is
reprinted in 1855. These clippings give an
excellent idea of the violence of Kentucky
politics in the time of Henry Clay.

There are a few clippings on the factory
system involving woman and child labor, two on
the history of Presbyterianism in Lexington,

 

 

 
McCalla, John M. 55

 

and two on the Lexington Light Infantry.

Among the pamphlets is an address in 1839
on the fiftieth anniversary of the Lexington
Light Infantry.

Two volumes include the family cookery,
medical receipt, and household book of the
McCallas in ante-bellum Washington and a gift
book from the 1890's.

A small photograph of General John McCalla
is dated about 1850, and has been transferred
to the Picture File.

 
 

McCalla, John = 56
791 items and 17 volumes added, 9-1-70:

concern chiefly the affairs of the Hill and
Varnum families of Washington, D. C.

John Moore McCalla. I writes ca. 1815 a
defense of the Kentucky troops who went to the
relief of Ft. Meigs during the War of 1812
under General Green Clay. By 1845 he is sending

detailed instructions from Washington to his
son Andrew in Lexington, Kentucky, relative to
the moving of his family to the Capital and the

settlement of his business affairs.

 
McCalla, John M 57

 

The remainder of this addition involves the

family of Helen Varnum Hill, who married John
Moore McCalla; II in 1864. Family and business
letters are written about the extensive and
complicated real estate holdings of the Hills
and Varnums,

Amos Kendall became entangled, 1862 to 1864,

in a dispute with the Assembly Baptist Church,
which had been built upon land belonging to
the Varnums. He writes in detail of this

quarrel,

 
McCalla, John M, 58

 

Letters during the war years are not nu-

merous, John M. McCalla II had friends in
Charlestown, W. Va., whose correspondence
illustrates the poverty and hopelessness in
the South at the end of the Civil War.

As John M., McCalla; I had qualified as an
attorney handling claims against the United
States, he received business letters from a
cousin, Charles P, McCalla of Augusta, Georgia,
who became involved in cotton speculation in

1866. By 1869, Charles McCalla was seeking

 
McCalla, John

 

 

M ae m 59
office under the Republican Party in Georgia,

finally appearing in 1871 as the "General
Book-Keeper" of the Western and Atlantic
Railroad under Foster Blodgett.

Family relationships, travel, and estate
business fill the correspondence. In 1887,
John and Helen McCalla built a house on 17th

Street designed by Hornblower and Marshall,
many of the details for which are noted.

Legal papers contain a large number of deeds
for real estate in Washington, D. C., together

 
McCalla, John M, 60

 

with guardianship reports of Joseph B. Varnum,
Jr., for his niece, Helen Hill.

Financial papers are interesting for the
names of businesses in Washington, D. C., and
for a number of tax assessments in that city.

The volumes consist of account books and

the literary and art notebooks of Helen Louise
Sargent.

McCanless, Cora (Perry). Papers. 1893-1933

 

This collection includes an assortment of
papers relating to the family of Cora Perry,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Monroe Perry.
Cora was married to William J. McCanless.

Included in the collection are six reports

from Asheville Female College citing Mrs.
McCanless's grades on individual academic
courses. The earliest one is dated Dec. 12,
1895, and the latest March 31, 1897.

Also included: a list of books used by the

 
McCanless, Cora (Perry)

Asheville City Public Schools in the sixth
grade dated 1890-1891 (list includes both
literary works and textbooks); a poem written
and recited by Mrs. McCanless at her high schoo
commencement April 26, 1895; an essay written
by Mrs. McCanless dated May 15, 1897, while she

 

was attending Asheville Female College (it won
the Sawyer Medal); several recital, commence-
ment and high school graduation programs dating
from May 12, 1893 to 1901; a photograph of Mrs,
Joseph Monroe Perry, dated 1914; and a Nation-

 
McCanless, Cora (Perry) 3
al Reemployment Service Card for William J. Mc-
Canless.

There are several documents relating to Wil-
liam J. McCanless's period of service in the
United States MarineCorps. In a sworn affi-
davit, dated Nov. 3, 1933, Robert L. Leckie

 

stated that William J. McCanless was being
truthful when he said that during the Samar
Island campaign in the Philippines in 1902,
the Sojoton River rose about 30 feet endanger-
ing the lives of the United States servicemen

 
McCanless, Cora (Perry)

stationed there. Leckie said he kept a "Strict
diary" during the campaign and includes his
diary entries for the period Jan. 2-6, 1902,
during the time the incident occurred. It
resulted in his company leaving the island and
the entire camp being transferred to a steep

 

bluff across the Sojoton River. Leckie referred
to "Old Gibisia", a black Philipino, who tried
to warn Captain Dunlap how quickly the river
could rise and cover the surrounding land area.
However, Dunlap would not listen to him think-

 
McCanless, Cora (Perry)

ing at first that Gibisia was homesick and
wanted to return to Basey on Samar Island.
Finally, when their camp begins to get flooded,
Dunlap gives the order to "vacate the island

to the cliff." Leckie said that Gibisia rigged
up a "rope ferry" to evacuate the men under
Dunlap's command. He gives a vivid description

 

of how uncomfortable it was clinging to the
cliffs drenching wet, with little food, waiting
for the river to go down. It is not explained
why Leckie felt it necessary to write to the

Also included in the diary entries was an ac-
count of the rescue of Col. Littleton W.T. Wal-
ler and his men also in their company. Waller
and his men had been lost in the mountains of
the island without food several days before
Jan. 2, 1902.

 

There are two notes signed by Waller (the
same Waller mentioned above), in reference to
McCanless, stating that McCanless served in the
Marine Corps and that he was a good soldier.
They are dated Sept. 2, 1902, and July 6, 1918.

 
McCanless, Cora (Perry) Z

In the one dated 1918, Waller was writing to

the Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army at
the War Dept. in Washington, D.C., regarding

McCanless's application for commission in the
Quartermaster Corps of the National Army.

William E. McCarron, Captain in the United
States Air Force and Associate Professor of
English at The USAF Academy in Colorado, in
1976 published a study of Thomas Godfrey's The
Prince of Parthia as part of the USAF Academy's

 

bicentennial program. Godfrey's The Prince of
Parthia is the first tragedy written by a
native American, the first tragedy to be pub-
lished in America, and the first play written

 

 
McCarron, William E. 2

 

by an American to be performed on the profes-
sional stage.

Thomas Godfrey was born in Philadelphia
December 4, 1736. Orphaned at thirteen, he was
apprenticed by relatives to a watchmaker. His
real interests, however, were academic and
poetic. He was encouraged in these interests

by Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin West, William
Smith, and Nathaniel Evans.

Godfrey left Philadelphia in the spring of
1759 and went to Wilmington, North Carolina

 
McCarron, William E. 3

 

where he spent the remainder of his short life.
He died in 1763 at the age of twenty-seven. He
had written and published poetry before moving
to N. C. He continued to do so until his
death. The Prince of Parthia written in 1759,
published in 1765, and perforned in 1767 was
his only dramatic work.

 

The McCarron.papers consist of the bicen-
tennial edition of the play edited with a crit-
ical introduction by McCarron, published and

Harris's Ferry, Lancaster County, Pennsylvani
on 23 August, 1746, and died in Rowan Gounty,
North Carolina, 21 Jan. 1811. His family
came to Thyatira about 1756. McCorkle, a
Princeton graduate in 1772, was called te

Dr, McCorkle delivered the address at the
laying of the corner stone of Old East at
the University of North Carolina on October

tees. He also became chairman of the commit-
tee of the trustees to propose a plan of ed-
cation for the new university.

The seven small volumes in this collec-

McCowns owned two mills on the Eno River, one
of which was Cole's Mill, described in this

Mostly letters of 1941-1943 about personal
affairs to Miss Jessie Marion Wall of Randleman,
N. C. (b. ca. 1921), then a student in the
Duke U. School of Nursing. She became Mrs.
McCoy ca. 1944,

This collection consists mainly of letters
by several U.S. Army soldiers and by Miss Wall's
mother, Mrs. Marion A. Wall. The letters are
chiefly valuable for what they tell about
camp life in the U.S. after Pearl Harbor. There

is some discussion of World War II, but since
the letters from overseas are censored, they
are not very informative. There is little
about student life at Duke.

Letters of 1941-1942 by Pvts. Jesse Giles
Lamb, of Ft. Knox, Ky., and Arthur Mohlar, of
Ft. Bragg, N. C., discuss training, camp life,
personal affairs, Duke U., and football.

Lamb, who came from Randleman, discusses
Judy Garland, Martha Raye, and the Condo Bro-
thers, who entertained Ft. Knox troops. Lamb
was in the 47th Armored Medical Bn. He had
previously been in the Army Air Force and the

 

 
McCoy, Jessie Marion (Wall) 3
Armored Engineers. He explains that since
members of tank and armored car crews are con-
stantly being banged up, the hospital is kept
busy. He also tells about a tornado in Ky.,
letters of Jan. 24 and Mar. 26, 1942.

Mohlar was in the N. C. maneuvers. He writes
on Nov. 9, 1941, that there have been several

 

accidental deaths in the Ft. Bragg area. He
writes from Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, on
April 3, 1942.

A coast artillery soldier, Victor Fortune,
writes on Aug. 13, 1942, about his dog, named

 
McCoy, Jessie Marion (Wall) 4
Idaho, who had been tried for murder in a case
which had excited national interest. The
animal was convicted and sentenced to two years
on a leash.

Wallace Wade, Sr., head football coach in
Duke U., is discussed on October 18, 1942.

Mrs. Wall enlisted as an auxiliary in the

WAAC (Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps), predeces-
sor of the WAC (Women’s Army Corps) and wrote
a number of letters from Ft. Des Moines, Iowa,
where she was stationed. Indeed, she wrote

nearly everything in the latter part of the

assigned to the 2nd Regt., later the 3rd Regt.,

a Sgt. In her chatty and informative letters

she tells much about social life in Ft. Des

attended meetings of the Order of the Eastern

 

Star, to which she belonged. She also men-
tions several churches, the American Red Cross,

Nathaniel McCreary, a steel polisher by
trade, enlisted at age eighteen in Company I,
42nd Regiment, Massachusetts Infantry, on Sept.
8, 1862. His regiment was sent to New Orleans
and then to Galveston, Texas. When Confederate

General John B. Magruder's forces retook Galves-
ton on Jan. 1, 1863, McCreary's regiment was
captured. He was taken to Houston, paroled, and
sent to a camp for prisoners near New Orleans,
where he remained for more than 5 months. He

 
McCreary, Nathaniel

 

returned to New York and was mustered out of the
army on Aug. 20, 1863.

This collection consists of letters written
by McCreary to his family while he was a prison-
er. There is one from Houston (Jan. 8, 1863)
and two from New Orleans, in which he describes
the camp for paroled prisoners at Bayou Gentilly,
near New Orleans, He mentions mail service,
rations, and visits to New Orleans.

One piece of stationery includes a pencil
drawing of Houston Prison.

William G. McCreary served for a short time
in an Ohio regiment of the U.S. Army during the
Civil War. This collection consists of letters
written to him or his family during the closing
years of the war.

The papers begin with several letters from
William F, Spencer who served in the 45th
Regiment of Ohio Volunteer Infantry. He dis-

cussed conditions in Atlanta after the fall of
that city and his support for the re-election

of Abraham Lincoln (Sept. 20, 1864).

Letters from John W. Reid contain a narrative
of Sherman's march from Atlanta to Washington.
Reid's comments are brief but good accounts of
the war in Georgia, S. C., North Carolina, and
Va. In a letter of May 30, 1865, he described
the Patent Office and the Capitol, places he

 

visited while he was encamped near Washington,
In an undated fragment of a letter written

during the war, a friend encouraged one "Henry,"

the recipient of the letter, to continue his

Carson (Smith) McCullers was born in 1917
in Columbus, Georgia, where she lived until
she went to New York to study music. She mar-
ried Reeves McCullers in 1937. After moving
several times and travelling abroad, she set-

tled in Nyack, N.Y. Despite poor health and

a tragic personal life, she wrote several nov-
els which established her as a prominent lit-
erary figure during and after World War II. She

 
McCullers, Carson (Smith)
died in 1967.

This collection consists of a typed, in-
scribed copy of her short story "A Tree. A
Rock. A Cloud."

231 items and 3 vols. added, 9-20-82: Nearly
all of the materials constituting this collection
were formerly owned by Jordan Massee, Jr., a

 

native of Macon, Georgia, and a cousin and close
friend of Carson McCullers. A catalog of the
collection that he compiled is a useful guide to
the portion of the collection that he owned, but
his original arrangement of the clippings has

been rearranged strictly chronologically. In
his catalog they are listed as Nos. VII-X under
the following headings: Interviews with Carson
McCullers, Books Containing Material on Carson
McCullers or Excerpts from Books, Articles a-
bout Carson McCullers, and Reviews of Books and
Plays of Carson McCullers. The catalog is filed
among the other volumes of the collection.

Most of the correspondence is between Carson
and her close friend Tennessee Williams, her
cousins Jordan Massee, Jr., and Paul Bigelow,

also of Macon, Georgia, and Dame Edith Sitwell.
The other largest group of letters is from
Carson's mother, Marguerita Smith, to Massee
and Bigelow. Other correspondents include Ed-
ward Albee, Bessie Brewer, Marielle Bancou,
Julie Harris, Dr. Mary Mercer, Glenwar Wescott,
Robert Whitehead, and Donald Windham.

 

The warm, personal letters from Tennessee
Williams to Carson and from her to him are quite
revealing about their relationship, lifestyles,
health, moods, travels and different residences,
writings, Carson's relationship with her husband

 
McCullers, Carson (Smith) 5

 

Reeves, and their attitudes toward some of thei
well-known contemporary writers. In 1948,
Carson was sued for $50,000 by her "alleged
collaborator," but there is only a reference to
the suit in the correspondence. Also there are
frequent comments about the writing and produc-
tion of Carson's play, Member of the Wedding in
which Julie Harris and Ethel Waters were the
leading actresses. In the latter 1940s Tennes-
see Williams wrote of the great popularity of
Carson's works in France and Italy and inquired
if she had an agent in England since he had

 

 
McCullers, Carson (Smith) 6°

 

seen so few of her books on display in shops
there.

The Rita mentioned in the correspondence is
Marguerita Smith, Carson's sister, who served
on the editorial staffs of Redbook and Mademoi-
selle. These magazines were avenues for the
publication of some of Carson's stories. Mrs.

Smith lived with Carson and Reeves in Nyack for
some years before her death, and although Rita
lived in New York she sometimes helped her
mother to care for Carson in her Nyack home.
The serious illnesses and physical handicaps

 
McCullers, Carson (Smith) fie
that Carson experienced during most of her life
are covered in the contents of the collection.

Edith Sitwell's letters to Carson begin in
1950 and continue into 1952. She wrote warmly,
understandingly, and in praise of Carson's
writing. In so doing she revealed some personal
information about herself.

By the summer of 1952 the McCullerses had a
country place in France not a great distance
from Paris at Bachivillers (Oise). Several of
the letters of the early 1950s were written by
Carson to her friend Kathleen Batteen whose

 

 
McCullers, Carson (Smith) 8

 

home was “Old Plaw Hatch" in Sussex, England.

Writings in the collection include holograph
poems by Carson and Edith Sitwell and typed and
printed copies of poems and stories by Carson.
There is also a typescript of her novel, Clock
without Hands. The numerous clippings are
largely reviews of her novels and plays and
interviews with her.

The Ledger, 1861-1865, belonged either to
McEnery & McCulloch or to whatever firm suc-
ceeded it in those years. James M. McCulloch
was dead by 1862, for there is an account for
his estate. The ledger is not labelled, but it
seems fairly clear that the records are those

 

of the McCulloch factory. Factory accounts at
the beginning of the volume include those for
P. D. McCulloch and Archibald Gray, both of
whom received monthly payments of varying

London, England.

 

Henry McCulloh (ca. 1700-ca. 1779) was one
of the many figures of 18th century England
who momentarily assumed positions of some
importance in colonial matters. His chief
importance historically is his role as drafter
of the Stamp Act of 1765. An account of his

life can be found in The North Carolina
Historical Review, vol. | anaes and Boyd, Some
16th Century Tracts.

The volume, his earliest known essay, was

 

 
Henry 2
a product of McCulloh's service from 1739 to
1745 as Inspector for Improving the Quit Rents
for North and South Carolina. He himself had
acquired a large grant of land in N.C, in 1737
and the following year had submitted two memor
ials concerning quitrents to the Treasury. Thug

 

when Robert Walpole and Lord Wilmington agreed
to an investigation and reform of quitrent
revenues in the Carolinas, McCulloh was asked
to undertake the task. It proved to be an un-
happy experience. Soon both officials in

 
nry 3
American and their friends in England were
hampering his work, and finally they managed
to cut off his salary and forced him to return
to England, There he began a protracted, and
in 1750 still unsuccessful, fight to rewover
his unpaid salary against opposition now led

 

by Walpole.

Under these conditions McCulloh's essay
is naturally a mixture 6fvappeals for payment
of hissalary and genuine exasperation with the
inefficiency of colonial administration. For

 
ry 4

 

McCulloh, Hen

the remedying of the latter situation he had
no specifie proposals other than the enforee-
ment of the existing duty of officials both
in America and England (especially governors
and the Board of Trade) to inform the crown
regularly and fully of their activities and

decisions. Fraud in quitrent payments and land
grants (as seen in the Granville grant in N.C
fluctuations in currency, and trade violations
all were occurring because those who might
prevent them were ignorant of what was happen-

a stamp tax.

laneous Essay with Respect to Our Great Boards,
to the Exchequer and to America, is dated Oct.

 

 

4, 1762, at Turnham Green, England, and is
Signed by Henry McCulloh. The essay is addres-
sed to John Stuart, Third Earl of Bute, who was
then first lord of the treasury.

McCulloh proposes and discusses various ad-

 
McCulloh, Henry, Fe

 

ministrative reforms for the British government,
He elaborates upon the Privy Council, the Court

of Star Chamber, the Exchequer, and colonial ad-
ministration. His arguments stress a tightening
of the king's control over his officials and the
encouragement of an orderly conduct of business,
McCulloh suggests rehabilitation of the Court of
Star Chamber as a check upon the highest royal

officials, For better colonial administration

he has a number of proposals: establishment of
a central records office for use by the Board of
Trade; procurement of revenue for use in the co

 
McCulloh, Henry, 8
onies by means of a stamp duty and a lower duty
on French rum, sugar, and molasses; strenghening
of the militia system by parliamentary legisla-
tion; the use of exchequer bills as a uniform
colonial currency; and regulation of the Indian
trade with statutes to which both chartered and
royal colonies would be subject.

The William and Mary Quarterly( Jan. 1958,
XV, No. 1, pp.71-73) gives details of the iden-
tity of Henry McCulloh (d. 1779); his son, the
colonial agenb, Henry Eustace McCulloh; and
Henry McCulloch who served in North Carolina
as Secretary of the Colony in 1754. Henry
McCulloh was a London merchant and land

speculator. See also t biography of McCulloh

1 vol. added, 5-15-64. This work by Henry
McCulloh is entitled “A Treatise Endeavouring
to Demonstrate That Let Who Will Be Entrusted
with the Direction or Management of Our Publick
Concerns, They Will Be Liable to an Infinite
Number of Misstakes and Inadvertencies in the
Whole of Their Conduct Unless They Restore the

 

Ancient System of Our Publick Boards, On the

Doing of Which the Dignity and Safety of This
Crown and Kingdom, Seem in a Great Measure to
Depend." The dedication is addressed to

 
 

McCulloh, Henry 11
Augusta, Princess Dowager of Wales, and is

signed by Henry McCulloh. The treatise is
undated, but it obviously dates before Augusta's
death in 1772. In the preface McCulloh refers
to the death of his royal patron. Im a work

of 1762, he states that his study of the royal
administration was made for Frederick, Prince

of Wales (d. 1751), who was Augusta’s husband;
see the preface to "A Miscellaneous Essay with
Respect to Our Great Boards, to the Exchequer

and to America.“ Apparently McCulloh refers

 
McCulloh, Henry 12
to Frederick in the treatise that he addresses
to the Prince's widow. McCulloh also petitions
Augusta to show his treatise to the “worthy
Prince, who now remains the Hopes of this nation.”
This prince is possibly George, Prince of Wales,
the son of Augusta who became George III in
1760. The treatise likely dates between 1751
and 1760.

McCulloh discusses the theory and practice of
the royal government and reviews its organization
since the reign of Queen Elizabeth. He elaborates

 

 
McCulloh, Henry ss uae 13
primarily upon the Privy Council and the
Treasury, but he also comments on other principal
administrative bodies, such as the Board of
Trade, the Admiralty, the Exchequer, and various
committees of the Privy Council.

This collection traces the migration of the
McCullough and Hutchison families from Ireland
to South Carolina. They were Scotch-Irish
Presbyterians from County Antrim. The earliest
letters are from Irish relatives of Robert and

Ann McCulloch (later changed to McCullough) who
emigrated to Newberry District and then to
Fairfield District, South Carolina, about 1820.
Letters in the 1820's from Charles Montgomery
of "Caugherty,"* Ireland, and David McCulloch

of "Lisbonon Connor," Ireland, discuss agricul-
tural conditions, currency problems, religious
differences between Catholics and Protestants,
and parishes and controversies within the
Presbyterian Church, including Arianism. Often
these topics are discussed in some detail, as
in the letters of October 7, 1827, and July 6,
1828, in which there are descriptions of debates
between clergymen in various places in Ireland.
The Montgomery-McCullough letters end in the
1840's when the correspondence becomes that of

 
McCullough=Hutcnison Family “''''" "3

 

the Hutchison [or Hutchinson] family, evidently
related to the McCulloughs. Archibald Hutchison
is a resident of Winnsboro, Fairfield District.
Letters in the 1850's to Archibald and Robert
Hutchison are from their parents and relatives
in Ballymoney, County Antrim, Ireland. The
letters from Ireland cease in the late 1850's.
Robert Hutchison goes to Illinois in 1855, is
forced to leave in 1861 for refusing to serve
in the Union Army, and is living in Nebraska
in 1869.

There is a gap in the papers of about fifteen
years. In the 1880's the letters are addressed

 
McCullough-Hutchison Family

 

to Robert Hutchison and Janie Hutchison of
Monticello, Fairfield District. The letters
come from friends and relatives who have moved
to Texas and from members of the Powell family
in Columbia. These later letters have less
substance than the earlier ones.

Also included are arrest warrants and other

legal notices, 1886-1889, listing Robert
Hutchison as constable.

"Caugherty," now spelled Caherty, is about
three miles northeast of Ballymena, County
Antrim, and a lesser distance south of

 
McCullough-Hutchison Family

 

Broughshane. "Lisbonon Connor" is the commu-
nity of Connor and Lisbunnan, about four and
one-half and six and one-half miles southeast
of Ballymena, respectively.

McDonald, Marshall. Papers. Washington, D. C.

 

Marshall McDonald, ichthyologist, inventor,
and teacher, was born in Romney, Virginia, on
June 26, 1835. McDonald's great-grandfather,
Angus McDonald, was a fugitive from Scotland
who settled in Winchester, Virginia, about
1750. Angus was a colonel in the French and

Indian War. Marshall McDonald's parents were
Lucy Ann (Naylor) and Angus William McDonald,
a Confederate Army colonel who died during the
Civil War. For further information on the

 
McDonald, Marshall 2
McDonald family, see the Letterpress Book (p.
315) in this collection and James B. Avirett's
The Memoirs of General Turner Ashby and His
Compeers (p. 318).

McDonald became a student of natural history
under Professor Spencer F. Baird at the Smith-
sonian Institution in 1854. Six years later he
graduated from Virginia Military Institute and
joined its faculty as an assistant professor.
During the Civil War McDonald rose from the
rank of captain to colonel in his service as an

 

 

 

 
McDonald, Marshall 3
ordnance officer and then later as the Senior
Engineer in Longstreet's Corps. After the war
he returned to V. M. I. to teach at various
times chemistry, mineralogy, geology, and metal-
lurgy. On December 17, 1867, McDonald married
Mary E. McCormick of Frankford, Virginia. They
had two children: Rose and Angus.

 

McDonald's career as an ichthyologist began
in 1875, when he became one of the Virginia
State Fish Commissioners. In 1879, he was ap-
pointed Assistant in Charge of Fish Culture in
the United States Fish Commission. He also

 
McDonald, Marshall 4
collected statistics on the fish trade for the
Census of 1880 and directed the survey of the
Great Falls Fishway in 1883. In Jan., 1888,
President Cleveland appointed McDonald the U. S.
Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries. He was the
President of the Americm Fisheries Society and
a member of the Washington Board of Trade.

 

McDonald had a fertile imagination for inventions
connected with his work with fish. He invented
a fishway, an automatic hatching jar, a tidal
hatching box, and an automatic water filter for

 
McDonald, Marshall >

 

home use,

Two collections of Marshall McDonald Papers
were combined into one when they were recata-
loged. Also note that the original spelling
of the family name was MacDonald; Marshall
shortened this to McDonald, although his wife
Mary continued to sign her letters with the
original spelling. For further information
“ore this matter, see the Letterpress Book, p.

30.

This collection is related to the Leavell-

 
McDonald, Marshall 6
McDonald Papers in this department. Marshall
McDonald and Edward Allen Hitchcock McDonald of
the Leavell-McDonald Papers were brothers.

There are only two items dated in the 1700's.
One is a copy of a letter, dated March 16, 1777,
from George Washington urging Angus McDonald
(1727-1778) to accept an appointment as a lieu-
tenant colonel in the Continental Army. The
other letter of 1798 is from John Henry.

The bulk of the correspondence begins in
1819. The letters in the 1820's primarily con-

 

 
McDonald, Marshall 7
cern the career of Marshall's father, Angus, as
a fur trader and Indian fighter. The St. Louis
Missouri Fur Company figures prominently in
these letters since Angus was a partner in the
company which was dissolved in 1824. There are
descriptions of several Indian tribes of the
plains, including the Sioux and Aricaras, whom
Angus saw on fur trading trips.

Letters in the 1830's through the 1850's are
of genealogical value because of the Griggs and
Berry family correspondence. The Reverend

 

 
McDonald; Marshall 8
Robert T. Berry is a prominent figure in the
letters of this period.

In 1859 begins the correspondence concerning
Marshall. The Civil War letters are of high
quality. There are letters and orders from
various army officers, particularly from Gen.
Martin Luther Smith. Information is contained

 

on the Civil War in Virginia, several Virginia

regiments, and McDonald's activities at New
Orleans and Vicksburg. There are good accounts
of the First Battle of Bull Run and of the

 
McDonald, Marshall _ 9
Vicksburg Campaign. In the fall of 1862,
MdDonald's personal correspondence dwindled
because of U. S. Army occupation and fighting.
The correspondence also concerns logistics and
the transportation of supplies for the troops.
A group of items called the Civil War Mili-

 

tary Papers have been separated and put at the
end of the collection. The maiority of these
papers covers the period 1862-1863, when McDon-
ald was Ordnance officer at Vicksburg for the
Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana.

 
McDonald, Marshall 10
These are official records, including invoices
of ordnance and ordnance stores, requisitions,
and receipts. They give a good indication of
the amounts and types of materials handled by
the Confederate Army. Included also are slave
rolls in Jan. and Feb., 1863, which indicate

 

the payment to the master for the use of the
slaves at the Vicksburg Arsenal. The few items
for 1864 to 1865 include a report of enemy
operations in West Virginia in 1864, invoices
and receipts for engineer property, and a list

 
McDonald, Marshall 11
of free Negroes turned over to the engineers at
Fort Anderson,

After the War there are McCormick family let-
ters and also many letters that McDonald wrote
from V. M. I. to Mary McCormick both before and
after their marriage. Gen. Francis H. Smith,

 

the superintendent of V. M. I., wrote several

letters to McDonald. McDonald's letters from

Lexington from 1866 to 1874 often make brief

references to Robert E. Lee and his family.
From 1876, when McDonald was a Virginia

 
McDonald, Marshall 12
State Fish Commissioner, through the early
1890's, the correspondence centers around fish
culture, ideas for inventions of fish hatching
devices, the distribution of young fish, and
visits to various fisheries. There is a large
correspondence beginning in 1878 on the McDon-

 

ald Fishway, a patented invention. In 1880,
particularly, McDonald spent much time travel-
ling in an effort to persuade fish commissioners
in various states to build his fishway on rivers
in their states. It won a gold medal at The

 
McDonald, Marshall 13
Great International Fisheries Exhibition in Lon-
don in.1883. In 1884 McDonald took a trip to
Europe as a member of the staff of the U. S.
Fish Commission in order to investigate and
study the methods of fish culture there. From
then through the 1890's, there is scattered cor-
respondence with persons in Scotland, France,
Germany, and England about fish and fishways.
During this whole period, there is correspond-
ence from American scientists and persons inter-
ested in fish, such as the naturalists Spencer

 

 
McDonald, Marshall = 14
F. Baird and William Stimpson, and also Fred
Mather, editor of Fish and Stream.

In August, 1887, Professor Baird, the U. S.
Fish Commissioner, died. From late 1887 through
Jan., 1888, most of the letters are from both
friends of McDonald and men of political influ-
ence, such as Senators and Congressmen,who were

 

 

attempting to secure McDonald's appointment as
U. S. Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries. There
seems to have been some controversy over McDon-
ald's rival, Thomas Barker Ferguson. Among

 
McDonald, Marshall 15
others, Dr. Tarleton H. Bean was instrumental
in securing McDonald's nomination in Jan., 1888.
The nomination was confirmed in February, and he
received many letters of congratulation.

Mary McDonald was elected as the first
Treasurer General of the National Society of
the Daughters of the American Revolution in

 

Dec., 1890. Although she resigned from this
position in 1892, there is correspondence about
membership and dues from 1891 through 1894.

The letters reveal much of the confusion in the
early days of the organization. Included is

 
McDonald, Marshall 16

 

correspondence with such prominent women as
Flora (Adams) Darling and Mary Desha. There is
a folder of undated D. A. R. correspondence and
a folder containing lists of members and dues
paid. Marshall was a member of the Sons of

the American Revolution, so there is a small
folder on that society.

The Letterpress Book, 1888-1892, contains
McDonald's correspondence while U. S. Fish
Commissioner. It primarily concerns the Fish
Commission, McDonald's water filter invention,

 
McDonald, Marshall 17

and fishways. Letters in 1890 refer to the
charges made against McDonald stating that as
Fish Commissioner he was enforcing the use of
his patented inventions and then exacting a
royalty for their use. Both loose letters and
the bound ones in 1890 discuss the Paddock

 

Bill to put the U. S. Fish Commission under the
Department of Agriculture.

A miscellaneous folder on fish includes lists

notes, writings, drawings, and printed material.
There are a few bills and receipts for Fish

 
McDonald, Marshall 18
Commission work in the financial papers. A
small handwritten volume for the Civil War
period notes military tactics, supplies, and
the organization of the First Army Corps of
the Confederate Army.

The 647 items added on 4-18-72, were included

in the original lot of papers, but were not
counted.

HISTORICAL SKETCH
She wasborn in 1830, the only child of
George McDuffie and Mary Rebecca Singleton, who
apparently died at the child's birth. These
letters of Mary McDuffie, beginning in 1849,show
her to be a well educated and remarkably intel-

ligent woman. Her father died in 1851, leaving
her as the sole heir and administratrix of his
large estate, consisting chiefly in plantations
and slaves. Most of the letters concern efforts
to settle the estate ahd sell the plantations

 
McDuffie, Marg Singleton. Historical Sketch. 2.

and slaves. This, however, was apparently never
done, although there were several prospective
buyers. In the management of her affairs she
was aided by various friends, but chiefly by Ar-
mistead Burt to whom most of the letters are ad—

dressed. The rest of the correspondence concerns
personal and family matters. In 1854 Ma?¥ Mco-
Duffie went abroad in company with her aunt, An-
gelica Singleton, who had married Abram Van

Buren, son of President Van Buren. In 1856

 
McDuffie, Mary Singleton. Historical Sketch. 3

Wade Hampton became interested in purchasing part
of the McDuffie property, and in 1858 married
Mary McDuffie. Later letters mention four chil-
dren:- George McDuffie, Mary, Alfred, and Daisy.
Mary McDuffie's connections were thus with

the most prominent families of South Carolina,
and her early life was that of a member of the

planting aristocracy. Although suffering the
reverses of war, she was never thrown into the

complete poverty that fell to the lot of some,
members of the planting class. Her letters dis-—
play much good sense in regard to the management
of her business affairs, although the property
was a burden of responsibility and anxiety to
her for several years.

Methodists in religious profession. The letters
of Joseph Rowlett include one from Kentucky.

The letters of David McGehee include one from

cousin John McGehee who went to Henry County,

of Virginia farming people. The Oct. 12, 187,

was a part of the movement before the Civil War

large promise at Nashville. In 1858 a charter
was finally obtained for Central University, but
no institution was founded before the Civil War.

This collection is made up of the papers of
Macgill, a Maryland surgeon, and of his family be
fore, during, and after the Civil War,

Personal, family, and professional letters,
umerous throughout the collection, are particu=

 

arly predominant from the beginning of the col-
ection to 1836,

The material from 1836 is indicative of Mac~
Bill's political affiliations. A letter dated

 
_Macgill, Charles

 

Sept. 16 of that year mentions him as one of the
Van Buren Electors of the Senate" and a circular
Lists the policies of the Democratic-Republ ican
weneral Committee. From this year until the ent-
break of the Civil War (with a few during the War
years) there are numbers of letters to Macgill
from Francis Thomas (179981876), state legislator

and governor of Maryland (1841-1876). These let-
ers are valuable primarily for their political
ontent, but also contain some information on the
arital scandal in which Thomas was involved,

of the Maryland militia, and other promoting
him to the rank of colonel, nfortunately, the
only other material bearing on this organization
is a feference to its reorganization because of
the Mexican War (see date May 20, 1846).

Of particular interest in the 1847 material
are several letters to Charles Macgill from his
only brother, James, who, stationed on the U.3.S.

Potomac took part in the Mexican War. His

 
q4~ Macgill, Charles

letters give enthusiastic accounts of naval ace
tivities off Vera Cruz and include a copy of a
letter from Alexander S. Mackenzie to him com-
mending his work there,

Various circulars and letters filed in the
decade of the 50's indicate that Macgill was a
member of the standing committee on surgery of

 

theMedical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryband.
These, together with requests for his medical
sdérvices and invitations to the opening of vari-

Ous railroad lines and to other civic fund=

 
Macgill, Charles

 

Surgeon and as a private citizen,

On October 1, 1861, Chas. Macgill was imprieo
soned, apparently on the grounds of his sympathy
for the South, at Fort Lafayette, but was later
sent to Fort Warren at Boston, Mass, Although
the papers contain the definite statement to this

effect, they seem to indicate that Charles was at
that thme theonly member of the Macgill family
who was actively hostile to the North, For some

months Mrs. Macgill speaks impartially of the m

 
ge. Macgill, Charles

military activities of both "Yankees" and "Reb~
els" but the prolonged confinement of her hus-
band without trial, the imprisonment of a son,
Pat, for several short terms, the wilful neglect
of Confederate wounded, and other depredations
committed upon the persons and property of Con-
federate sympathizers by tkek Union sympathizers,

 

soon alli@e both her and her famity with the
Southern cause. From the time of Chas. Macgill's
transfer to Fort Warren until his release tn No-

vember of 1862, the set 1s made unusually valua-

 
7=- Macgill, Charles

 

ble by the fact that it contains not only Char-
les' letters, but also his wife's answers to
them. The former indicate that he was treated
with the greatest kindness and lived very com-
fortably, his enforced idleness and rage against
his captors beinghis greatest trials. On the
other hand, the letters of his wife, daughters,
and nieces, give accounts of days filled with
nursing sick and wounded, of high prices, of ag-
ricultural activities, of local gossip, and

particularly of citizens required to take the

 
Be Macgill, Charles

 

oath of allegiance to the United Saates, and of
the indgnities to which their persons and prop-
erty were subjected when they refused to do so,
There are a few letters from Francis Thomas
in answer to Molly's (Mrs. Macgill's) pleas to
him to use his influence to have her husband re-
leased. They are particularly interesting be~

cause they reveal so clearly the writer's own
political attitude. He insisted that Dr. Mac-
gill would be freed if he would take the oath of

allegiance and that this oath simply affirmed

 
 

g. Macgill, Charles

the signer's loyalty to the Union and the Consti-
tution and in no way committed him to the support
of the administration's policies. Macgill did
not agree with this line of reasoning, however,
and refused consistently throughout his term of
imprisonment to take the oath,

Also of particular interest at his period
are cautions in Charles! letters to Molly not to
write on political or military subjects as he
would not in that case be allowed to receive the
letters,

Molly's descriptions of the aftermath of

 
Macgill, Charles

the battle of Sharpsburg are very graphic. She
and her daughters took several wounded Confeder
ates into their home to nurse, and she inter=
Sperses accounts of their progrees with indignant
@llusions to Southern wounded who died of expo-
sure because their captors would not permit them
to be taken into homes or hospitals until they
ere formally paroled,

The correspondence after Dr. Macgill's re-
tease becomes rather sketchy, It seems that at

Heast two of his sons, James and Barlow (taken

 

 
hie Macgill, Charles

prisoner and confined at Fort Delaware) were
serving with the Confederate forces, It is pos-
sible that Dr. Macgill also was doing active
medical duty with Lee's forces near Richmond,

& letter from Molly to her husband and sons
Just after the surrender in 1865 warns then not
to return to Hagerstown since they would not yet
be safe from the almost maniacal Unionists,
the same letter she deplores Lincoln's assassi-~
mation as the act of a madman,

In 1865 the Macgill family moved to Richmond

 

 
he. Macgill, Charles

and Charles went into partnership with Geo, P,
Kane in the Roanoke Tobacco Company located at
Danville, Virginia, The papers bearing on this
concern run from 1866 through 1869 and constitute
@ most valuable portion of the collection, They
include informatio on the purchase prices of to-
bacco, machines for its manufacture, the possi-
bilities of combining the scrap with bone dust
for fertilizer, and innumerable business trans-
actions of the firm, The organizabion disinte-

grated in 1869, probably due to financial
difficulties.

 

 
Macgill, Charles
The papers from the decade of the 70's have

 

g-

to do with the triel of Dr. Macgill hy the
Richmond Academy of Medicine for a breach of
medical ethics. Although the case caused some
little stir at the time, the charges were not of
a serious nature and he apparently was acquitted,
The papers from 1877 on are recommendations

from more-or-kess important political figures
for General James Macgill (son of Dr. Macgill)
for the office of Commissioner to mark the

graves of Confederate soldiers.

McGregor, John R. Papers. Washington, D.C.

 

John R. McGregor had a number of occupations
during 1855-1877. He worked as a clerk at the
Post Office Department and perhaps elsewhere,
and he operated several stores: house furnish-
ings; paint, oil, gas, lamps, artists' supplies,
etc.; and groceries and wood. He did not live

continuously in Washington. He owned a house in
Aquia Township, Stafford County, Virginia, and
some of his absences from Washington may relate

to that location.

 
McGregor, John R. 2
McGregor's Ledger, 1855-1877, contains re-
cords from several of his enterprises, primarily

his house furnishings store, paint store, and
grocery store and wood supply business. The
house furnishings store and paint store were in
Washington. It is not clear where he was lo-
cated when he ran the grocery store and sold

 

wood, but the customers were in Washington. On-
ly a small part of the records concern Stafford
County. The volume contains approximately 220
pages of records. Many pages have been torn

 
McGregor, John R. 3

 

out.

The first 81 pages of McGregor's ledger re-
cord his business enterprises in Washington,
D.C., during 1855-1857. Facing page one there
is the text of his agreement of April 26, 1855,
with Robert Israel to engage in a new and
secondhand house furnishing business. Israel

had been in this work before, for he is listed
in "house furnishing" in the city directory for
1855. He is also listed as a furniture dealer
in the directories of 1858 and 1860. By 1858

 
McGregor, John R. 4°
McGregor and Israel had parted company, because
each is listed separately in the directory for
that year. McGregor is listed in 1858 as sell-
ing paints, oils, etc. Boyd's Washington and
Georgetown Directory for 1858 includes an ad-
vertisement (p. xix) for McGregor in which he

is listed as follows: "manufacturer of ethereal

 

 

 

oil, and dealer in paints, oils, window glass,
artists' materials, camphene, sperm, lard, solar
and pine oil, turpentine, paints, brushes,
lamps, etc., etc." A variety of types of both

 
McGregor, John R. 5
oil and gas are listed in the accounts. Both
oil and gas were used for lighting as well as
other purposes. Some accounts are for sales
to artists (pp. 15, 50, 64, etc.). The accounts
for both of McGregor's businesses, his partner-
ship with Israel in house furnishing and the
store for paints, oils, etc., appear on pages l-
81. The goods being sold are often described
in the entries only as merchandise, but types
of commodities do appear in the entries.

The second section of the ledger, pages 83-

 

 
McGregor, John R. 6°
90, contains accounts during 1860-1861, possibly
for a general store. McGregor is not listed in
the Washington directories for 1860 and 1862,
and most of the persons for whom there are ac-
counts are also not listed. So, these records
are not from Washington. There is an account
for John M. Stewart. Both Stewart and McGregor
were later in Stafford County, and these ac-
counts may be from there.

McGregor disappeared from the Washington
directories in 1860 and 1862, reappeared as a

 

 
McGregor, John R. 4
clerk there in 1867-1869, and disappeared again
during 1870-1872. He had a house in Aquia
Township, Stafford County, Virginia, for there
are copies of his contracts to rent it to others
in 1874 (p. 248) and 1877 (p. 350). He was back
in Washington as a clerk in 1880.

The accounts, 1868-1871, on pages 100-347 are

 

from the period when McGregor was not listed in
the Washington directories. If he was not liv-
ing in the city, he was nearby, because his
customers are listed in the Washington direc-

 
McGregor, John R. 8

 

tory. His business had two aspects. He appar-
ently had a store that handled mostly basic
food commodities such as flour, tobacco, meat,
sugar, whiskey, fish, etc. He also supplied a
considerable quantity of wood. The wood was
often listed in cords, and part of it was per-
haps bought for firewood. Customers sometimes

paid their bills with wood. Occasionally there
are entries for McGregor's payments to persons
for labor, the accounts on pages 101-103 being
examples. One of these accounts is for a black.

James McHenry (1753-1816) was a pupil of
Benjamin Rush, served in the Revolutionary War,
became secretary to George Washington, and
mentor to Lafayette, entered the Maryland
Senate and the U. S. Congress, and became
Secretary of War under Washington and Adams

(till 1801). Fort McHenry below Baltimore is
named for this distinguished physician. To him
the army owes many radical changes and improve-
ments. Among the Benjamin Rush letters is one
dated 1776 from McHénry at Fort Washington to

 
McHenry, James, 2
Rush. McHenry became a prisoner when this fort
fell to the British.

Dr. John Morgan, medical director of the
Continental Army and founder of the University
of Pennsylvania Medical School, writes to Mce-
Henry, secretary to George Washington, regarding
the impending court-martial of Dr. William

 

Shippen, which Mérgan expects to attend.

A draft of "An Act to regulate the Medical
Establishment", ca. 1796-1798, was sent to Mc-
Henry, as Secretary of War. This act provided
for a Physician General in charge of all milita

 
McHenry, James 3
hospitals, and all medical and surgical service
of the Army or Navy of the United States. It
also set up a Purveyor of supplies, an Apothe-
cary, and other Medical personnelX, All appoint-
ments are subject to: the approbation and contra
of the President of the United States. The act
provided for the establishment of military hos-
pitals.

In 1814, Hugh Williamson (1735-1819),
scientist, physician, army surgeon, and N. C.
delegate to the Constitutional Convention of
1787, writes to McHenry concerning the state of

 

 
McHenry, James 4

 

health and his family in 1814, the year McHenry
died.

McHenry married Margaret Allison Caldwell,
sister of Dr. John B. Caldwell and a member of
an old Maryland family. On the death of Dr.
Caldwell, a memorial was sent to the Morning
Chronicle (Baltimore?) by an anonymous frtend,
who quotes a long poem by Sydenham.

Lachlan McIntosh was born near Raits, Bade-
nock, Scotland, March 17, 1725 and died in
Savannah, Ga., Feb. 20, 1806. His father,
John Mohr McIntosh, came to Georgia in 1736
with James Oglethorpe and settled at Inverness,

 

now Darien. When Oglethorpe invaded Florida
in 1740, John Mohr McIntosh was captured, im-
prisoned in Spain for two years, and died a

few years later as a result of this imprison-

ment. Lachlan had

little formal education, but at the age of
seventeen he became a clerk in Charleston
counting fouse and lived with the family of
Henry Laurens. He returned to inverness,
became a surveyor, studied mathematics with
Oglethorpe, and interested himself in civil

 

engineering and military tactics. In Sept.1776,
he was appointed brigadier-general. In 1777
he mortally wounded Button Giwinett in a duel,

the campaign against the western Indians. With
500 men he march%‘to Fort Pitt and working from
there established order on the frontiers of
Pennsylvania and Virginia. He completed arrange

and then went to Savahnah, where he commanded
the first and fifth S. C. regiments, and after
driving the British from their outposts, took a
active part in the siege, When the city surren-
dered, he returned to Charleston, was present at
its surrender to Sir Henry Clinton, and was held
prisoner of war for a long time. On his return
to Ga. he found his property lost. He was a mem
ber of Congress in 1784 and in 1785 he was ap-
pointed commissioner to treat with the southern
Indians. His later life was spent in retirament
and comparative pover ty.

McIntosh from two British officers on board
the Henchenbrook, This letter forms part of
the negotiations for the release of some Ameri-
Cans held on a British ship, for the release
of some British ships being held in Savannah

McIntosh lost some of his Savannah property
and in 1782 he attempted to regain it as is
indicated by the protest entered at that time.

These miscellaneous papers center in two
groups of letters. The first by Kate Crosland
of Walnut Hill, §.C., to friends in Georgia
contains an interesting letter on Dec. 28,1864,
on the eve of General Sherman's march across

 

8.C. Giving a blistering evaluation of W.T.
nem 3 a Confederate woman, the letter con-

tinues with the account of a Negro insurrectio
in N.C, in 1864, a resulting lynching in S.C.,
an evaluation of the slave population, and a

description of a smallpox outbreak in S.C. The
second group of letters is written by Dr.Thos.
M..McIntosh, son of Septima and J.A. McIntosh,
of Thomasville, Ga., to his sister Emma. He
was studying at Atlanta Medical College in 187

Dr. A.W.Calhoun, of lectures on mental diseaseg
and most interestingly on Nov. 8, 1874, of the
debate among studeats and professors in the
subject of admi&sion of women to medical
schools. Among the correspondents are

This is an interesting
and informative letter which gives a cross sec-

tion of U.8. economics, politics, and current
events of the spring of 1842, Olmsted mentions
the negotiations leading to the Webster-Ashbur=
ton Treaty, the friction between Henry A. Wise

 
McIntyre, Archibald (1771 or 1772-1858)

and Edward Stanley, the trouble between John
Tyler and Henry Clay, Dorr's Rebellion and suff-
erage, and the Whig and Locofoco parties. A
strong feeling of unsound economic conditions
and general lack of money runs through the let-
ter, Olmsted tells of a Biddle, Couverthwaite,

 

and Andrews lawsuit, as well as the failures of
many merchants.

127 items added, 11-3-72: Primarily corres-

McIntyre, Archibald (1771 or 1772-1858) 4
jointly by McIntyre and probably two other men.
This addition spans the years 1847 through 1854,
years when McIntyre was an elderly man.

The letters to McIntyre were written mainly
be three men: H. Baldwin, Frederic Bronson, and
Mathew W. Davis. Baldwin went to Europe in an

 

attempt to sell McIntyre's land and also made
such negotiations in the United States. As an
agent for McIntyre and also an executive and
trustee of the North Carolina Manufacturing,
Mining.and Land Company, Bronson wrote often to

 
weiner, Archibald 214 or 1772-1858) 6
the 1850's, describing the property and telling
of the prospects for finding gold there. Par-
ticularly interesting is a report in June, 1850,
by Ebenezer Emmons, an eminent geologist, on his
inspection of the property. He reported that

much of the land was rich in gold.

Included also is a copy of the charter of
February 12, 1851, to incorporate the North
Carolina Manufacturing, Mining and Land Company.
In 1853, arrangements were made to sell the land
to John B. Murray, but the papers in 1854 indi-

 
McIntyre, Archibald (1771 or 1772-1858) P
report on the progress of negotiations for the
sale of the land. Davis was a land agent whose
responsibility it was to protect the land and
make arrangements for leasing the land for the
absentee landlords.

Although most of the letters deal with at-
tempts to sell the property, there are a few

 

good letters (1850-1852) giving technical de-

tails concerning North Carolina gold mines, par-
ticularly the Phoenix and Reed Mines in Cabarrus
County. Also there is correspondence throughout

 
McIntyre, Archibald (1771 or 1772-1858)
cated that by then the sale had not been com-
pleted,

Although a few of the letters in this collec-
tion are addressed to McIntyre using the middle
initial "Ww," it has been omitted from the name
on the title card. McIntyre did not use the

 

initial in signing his letters, and the Albany
City Directory did not use a middle initial.

The same form has been used as that in the Na-
tional Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections

for 1962.

that he had another version of this diary. --

Diary of B. .. McIntyre who was with the
19th Iowa Volunteer Infantry when it left Keo-
kuk, Iowa, September 4, 1862. His diary re-
cords daily occurrences, until August 14, 1864
when his regiment left for Pensacola, Florida
on the steamer, Propeller Josephine. This ac-
count completes the pages of the third volume,
thus implying that later volumes must have been
lost.

Although McIntyre probably started his ar-

 

 
McIntyre, B. F. 2
my career as a private, he was a lieutenant by
April 1863 and served as the captain for com-
pany "A" in the summer of 1864. Throughout the
diary he keeps the viewpoint of the men of the
ranks and severely criticises instances of
officers maltreating their men.

Manifestly well-educated, McIntyre writes

 

fluently and comprehensively. Many of the in-
stances he cites have a highly dramatic quality
such as the woman searching for her husband, a
Confederate soldier, among the dead after the

battle of Pea Ridge in northwestern Arkansas,

 
McIntyre, B. fF. 5
and the detailed description of the execution
of a deserter from the Texas Cavalry at Camp
Brown, Texas. Lt. McIntyre, with singular de-
tachment observes that the Negroes in Union
territory are in no better circumstances than
in Confederate hands; he speaks of the enemy ag
deluded rather than totally bad; he records
but denies the truth of stories about Confeder-
ate atrocities and with equal veracity recounts
the inhuman treatment of Union soldiers by Gen-
eral James Totten and lesser officers. A heavy
two-day storm on the Gulf of Mexico is des-

 

 
McIntyre, B. F. 4

 

cribed by frequent entries during the day.
Detailed accounts are given of the battles
in which McIntyre's company were engaged. Two
months after the 19th Iowa Volunteer Infantry
left Keokuk a group of raw recruits, they
visited Pea Ridge (Nov. 4) and a month later,
after forced marches through Arkansas and

Missouri, they fought at Prairie Grove,
Arkansas. The Battle of Vicksburg is recorded
from the time of their arrival on June 15
through the surrender and occupation of the
city. Friendly yet curious relationships be-
tween the two armies were established.
McIntyre

 
McIntyre, B. F. i)
admired the enemy at Vicksburg, saying they
"€id not display the fear and cowardice of
troops in Missouri and Arkansas." General
Grant is characterized as a man of fine propor=
tions and greatly reverenced by his men,

The suspense feit by the soldiers before th
battle of Sterling Farms, Louisiana) is por-
trayed by each day's entry concerning hourly
muster roll and rumors of the enemy being near.
For Sunday, Sept. 13 there is the entry; "the
thing seems now plain enough we are placed here
as a mere bait." The following Saturday they

 

 
McIntyre B. F. _6
were sleeping on their arms; in another ten
days their knapsacks with all their ecuipment
and changes of clotheg, and the following day
the Confederates attacked, capturing almost all
of the Federal men, The remaining troops were
immediately retired by boat to Morganzie--the
expedition a total loss.

 

The 19th Iowa Volunteer Infantry was sta-
tioned at Fort Brown, Brownsville, Texas for
nine months, This was the longest period in
one place that was recorded, The length of
time gave ample opportunity to observe condi-
tions. Negro troops oe used for hard

Tabor while white men performed light camp du-
ties. The political situation at Matamoras,
Mexico, and the social relations between the
governor of the province and the U. 8. Army are
discussed. Social customs and manners such as
bull fights and especially the Catholic Chérch
are described at length. "One of the finest

 

days I ever experienced (Dec. 2, 1863) but o
how dull--I am sick of the sights that daily
meet with hairless Mexican dogs bare breasted

sugar plumbs tired of the sameness there is

creation that should have been and richly de-

McIVER, John Letters. 1852-1868
Moore county, N. C. 22 pieces

 

The collection contains the family corres-
pondence of Dr. John McIver of Moore county,
N. C. There are five Civil War letters which
reveal little as to military operations and
Camp life, but they are full of personal matters
A cousin, James D. McIver, was a union man un-
til the election of Lincéln (see James D. McIver
to John McIver, Aug. 14, 1863). 4e recognizeé

the consequences of war but was unwilling to

 
McIVER, John 2

 

accept the proposals of re-union in 1863. There
was an attempt to elect a "union" legislature
and McIver was proposed as a candidate, which
he evidently rejected. The majority of the let-
ters are from D. J. McIver, a brother, who
moved to Mississippi after the war. Suffering

from i111 health, D.J. McIver had difficulty
in managing a large farm. To add to his troubles
some misunderstanding led his father to exclude

him from his will. It 1s not plain whether

 
McIVER, John 3

 

D. J. persuaded his brothers and sisters to
share their property with him.

The value of the collection lies in the
comments on the political situation in North
Carolina in 1863, in the description of plan-
tation life, and its hardships, in Mississippi
in the late 1860's, and in the light shed on
the family life of the McIvers of Moore county,

Eliza Anne (McQueen) Mackay (1778-7) was the
daughter of John McQueen, an ardent patriot, a
captain in the navy of 6.C., and on accasion
the confidential agent of Washington and LaFay<'

ette. Eliza Anne was born Apr. 23, 1778 at
the "Grange," the Savannah River plantation of
Basil Cowper, an uncle-in-law. He and another

uncle by marriage, James Wright, were strong
Loyalists, After the wawm John McQueen lost his
property in land “er and, to escape

further trouble, he went to Spanish East Flor-
ida, which was outside the jurisdiction of
American courts. His wife, with her four chil
dren, followed the Cowpers to London. When Mreé
McQueen later returned to her native state of
8. C. and Mrs. Cowper went to Jamaica, Eliza

was placed in school in England. There she
remained for ssveral years. During part of
this period Robert Mackay was in Scotland.
In 1791, Eliza, then a child of thirteen,
left England to rejoin her mother, Mrs. Mc-
Queen was then tavinggy her parents on a

 
Mackay, Eliza Anne (McQueen). Sketch. 3

 

plantation near Savannah. There, except for
visits to her father in East Florida, Eliza re-
mained until she married Robert Mackay on Jan.
350, 1800, They had eight children,

Robert Mackay was born in Augusta, Ga. on June,
1772, the son of Robert Mackay, an enterprising

Scottish merchant, and Mary (Malhone) Chilcott
Mackay. The elder Mackay died in 1775 and his
estate was dissipated during the Revolution.
When Robert returned in 1789 from school in
Edinburgh he found his mother practically des-
titute. Finding no @ portunity in Augusta

 
Mackay, Eliza Anne (McQueen). Sketch, 4

 

he went to Savannah, where he secured work in
a store. From such humble beginnings he de-
veloped into one of the leading merchants of
that city.

For five years Robert and hts wife lived in
England, returning to Savannah in 1811. ‘Two

years later he bought the "Grange," and there
engaged in rice planting in addition to trading

S. Davis, Charlotte Elliott, and M.C, McQueen.
Some of the more interesting letters are
those of John Mackay, one of Eliza's sons.
They reveal that he spent at least the decade
of the 1830's in the U. 8S. army. In Oct., 18629
he wrote about a horse race in N, Y, in which
northern and southern horses participated. In
Mar., 1830 he wrote from Fort Mitchell of trav-
elling with a Cherokee delegation that had been
to Washington to see Pres. Jackson. Two years
later he wrote from La. about the high price of
slaves there, In ® 1838 he was at the

 
Mackay, Eliza Anne (McQueen). Sketch. 7

 

Cherokee Agency near Calhoun, Tenn. Later he
was stationed in Florida.

There are letters from Joseph Stiles, a Yale
student, to his aunt, Kate Mackay, describing
some aspects of student life there. A letter
from Pendleton, 8. C., in 1847 reports a dance
which two of John C. Calhoun's sons attended,
Mre, E, A. Stiles wrote in Nov., 1847 from
Washington about the appearance of Gen. Tom
Thumb there. A letter of Oct.2, 1848 from Sav-
annah speaks of how much money the Whigs are
said to have spent, & Mre, E. A, Stiles

 
Mackay, Eliza Anne (McQueen). Sketch. 8

on Mrs, Alex. Hamilton, Mrs, John ©, Calhoun,
and Mrs, Castron, wife of one of the judges of
the Supreme Court, giving her impression of

37 items added, 5-20-64. These manuscripts
indicate some of Robert Mackay'’s travels in
1797-1799. The letter of Jan. 31, 1797, from
young William McLean suggests that Mackay is in
Savannah. Most of the manuscripts date from
1798 when he was in Bordeaux, France, and they
consist primarily of business correspondence and

accounts (some undated) for lodging and
purchases. Two letters show his plan to visit
Hamburg, Germany, after leaving Bordeaux. A
few accounts, including one of late 1798, are

various friends and business matters. A
clearance paper for Mackay and the brig, Eliza,
place him at St. Augustine, Florida, in August,
1799, bound for Savannah.

A few miscellaneous business papers bear
dates as late as 1808.

John H. McKelpesh enrolled on Oct. 28, 1816,
in the class of Dr. Nathaniel Potter in the
practice of Physick at the University of Mary-
land, Potter (1770-1843), a pupil of Dr. Ben-
jamin Rush and the Dean of the Medical Depart-
ment, delivered eighty-six lectures during the

winter of 1816-1817. His first session consi-
dered the non-contagious nature of Yellow Fever,
evidently a preliminary to the memoir he wrote
in 1818, "On contagion, more especially as it

 
McKelpesh, John H,
respects Yellow Fever."

The McKelpesh notebook discusses treatments
of fevers and the more usual diseases. Dr.
Potter at times took his class into the hospital
for clinical lectures (see Nov. 23, 1816).

He referred briefly and numerous times to the
theories of Drs. Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Smith
Barton, and William Cullen, as well as observa-
tions from his own experience,

Alfred Augustus McKethan started a plant for
manufacturing carriages and buggies in Fayette-
ville, N. C, in 1832, His trade developed
rapidly until he was selling carriages in most
of the southern states. During the war, busi-
ness was continued at least for the first part

of the war, The physical plant of the factory
occupied over an acre on Person Street in
Fayetteville. After the war, McKethan was
joined by his sons, Hector McAllister and Alfred

Augustus, Jr. Much of the work soon after the
war consisted of repairs.

The latter part of this correspondence is
composed of letter from Alfred A. McKethan, the
son of Edwin Turner McKethan, Alfred A. McKeth
an was a graduate of the U. S. Naval Academy
in the class of 1895. While there young Mc-
Kethan was well acquainted with Dr. R. L.

at Annapolis, while stationed in Honolulu from
1895-1895, and while cruising on U. 8S. steamers

U. S. Congressman, to a constituent concerning

a “privatering memorial" before the Congress
in 1812.

Isaac McKim reported on April 9, 1824, on

McKoy, William Berry. Papers, 1853-1916.
Wilmington, New Hanover Co., North Carolina
William Berry McKoy (b. 1552), lawyer, was
the son of William Henry McKoy, a Wilmington
merchant, and Francinia Eliza Berry. He was
educated in private schools, the Cape Fear
Academy, and Princeton University. In 1879 he
was admitted to the bar and legal practice in

 

Wilmington. He served as a director of the
Mechanics Home Association, a building and loan
firm, as chairman of the Democratic Executive
Committee, and as Grand Master of the Masons in

 
McKoy, William Berry 2
North Carolina. In 1386 he married Katherine
Bacon, the daughter of Henry Bacon, Sr., a civil
engineer whose career included work in construc-
ting the Illinois Central Railroad and on the
Cape Fear River. Henry Bacon, Jr., was the
architect for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington
D.C. Genealogy of the family appears in the
Letterpress Book, 1889-1915, pp. 223-228. A
biographical sketch of William McKoy is in the
History of North Carolina (Chicago and New York,
1919), V, 327. See Henry Bacon McKoy, The McKoy

 

 

Family of North Carolina (Greenville, S.C.,

1955). a)

 

 
McKoy, William Berry

The collection includes two volumes from the
work of Henry Bacon, Sr., with the Illinois Cen-
tral Reilroad in the 1850's. There is consider-
able material about William McKoy's legal bus-
iness and Masonic work, 1879-1915. His Letter-
press Book, 1889-1915, also represents some of
his educational, political, and banking active

 

ities. Records of the legal business include
Robert H. McKoy, his brother, and Thomas H.
McKoy, Jr., his first cousin, who were partners
in the late 1870's and early 1880's. The grocer

 
McKoy, William Berry 4
business of Thomas H. McKoy 5 Sr., is represented
by a Letterpress Book, 1879-1880. Political
material primarily concerns Wilmington and New
Hanover County.

In the 1850's Henry Bacon, Sr., worked on the
construction of the charter lines of the Illinoi
Central Railroad. His two account books of 1853

 

1856 and 1856-1869 record personal and profes-
sional accounts and memoranda, many of which re-
late to the railroad. The Account Book, 1853-
1856, includes detailed estimates, January-May>»

 
 

McKo William Berry BS 5
1854, for the LOth and llth divisions of the

railroad and other statistics earlier and later,
including a description of the 9th-llth divis-
ions, Nov. 18, 1853 (p. 17). During the first
half of 1854 the railroad was built from Kanka-
kee to Urbana, passing through Iroquois County
where Bacon owned property. There are scattered

drawings and computations for the roadbed and
adjacent structures. The greater part of both
volumes contains computations, drawings, and con
tracts for the cutting of timber, especially

from property in —_ County.

 
McKoy, William Berry 6
William Henry McKoy had three sons: William
Berry (b.1852); Robert Hasell (b. 1855); and
Halling (b. and d. Jan. 25, 1857). An Account
Book, 1875-1877, begins with expense accounts
for W.B., ReH.-, and Mrs. F.E. McKoy, their mother
The accounts probably belonged to the family
rather than to one of the brothers alone. By

 

this time William Henry McKoy was dead, as the
city directory for 1871 lists Mrs. McKoy as a
widow.

The Ledger, 1877-1878, has William B. McKoy's

 
McKoy, William Berry
name on the first page and on most of the
accounts.
Ledger A, 1878-1880, apparently belonged to
both Robert H., and William B. McKoy and to
Thomas H. McKoy, Jr., their first cousin. There
are personal accounts for William and Robert,
accounts for their taxes (pp. 14-15), and a
joint bank account (p. 80). Office accounts
(pp. 53, 88-89) are apparently for. the law part-
nership. The city directory of 1879 lists
Robert H. and Thomas H. McKoy, Jr., as partners,

 

 
McKoy, William Berry 8
and the directory for 1981 adds William.

The Voter Registration Book, 1896-1897, is
for Harnett Township, New Hanover County. Regis
trations are recorded as early as 1890, but the
book was used for elections in 1896 and 1897.
Voters are listed with their residences, occupa-
tions, ages, and places of birth. Party affil-
iation is not given, but race is.

William B. McKoy was a prominent Mason in
North Carolina. In 1904 he was Master of the
Wilmington Lodge, and in 1912 he was Grand Maste

 

 
McKoy, William Berr 9

of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina. Two vol-
umes and one folder of correspondence and printed
material are official records of the Masons,
1875-1913. The bulk of the material dates from
1912 and is from the office of the Grand Master.
There is both incoming and outgoing correspon-
dence, and various local and state lodges are

 

represented as well as several foreign Masonic
organizations. Charitable work includes the
Oxford Orphan Asylum, the beginnings of the
Masonic and Eastern Star Home for the aged and

 
McKoy, William Berry 10
indigent at Greensboro, and the governing rules
for the Odd Fellows Orphan and other homes at
Goldsboro. Materials are scattered throughout
the two volumes both topically and chronologic-
ally.

A Letterpress Book, 1879-1880, contains the
business correspondence of Boatwright and McKoy,

 

grocers, in Wilmington. The proprietors were
John L. Boatwright and Thomas H. McKoy, Sr. In
mid-1880 the firm was dissolved and reconstitu-

ted (p. 381), but the exact nature of the new

 
McKoy, William Berry il
ownership is unclear. After the change McKoy
usually signed the correspondence alone, but
Boatwright's name occasionally appeared, as on
pe 392. The city directory of 1881 lists Boat-
wright as a grocer, but not McKoy, so further
changes probably occured. The correspondence
ended in October, 1880. Most of the letters con

 

cerned business. However, in February, 1880,
McKoy wrote two letters to Senator Zebulon B.
Vance about the need for federal legislation
against the adulteration of food. These letters

 
McKoy, William Berry
and rejated ones are on pages 237-246. W. 5S
McKoy addressed Thomas H. McKoy, Sr., as his un-
cle in the Letterpress Book, 1889-1915, p. 201.
Two volumes are indices to a law library.
Both indices date from the 1880's and belonged
to the same library, for one index is an alpha-
betical index to the other. A cash account for

 

1883 is in the early pages of the volume marked
"Index Library 1885." A third volume is an index
to an unidentified legal work.

The Letterpress Book, 1889-1915, is for

 
 

McKo William aorry 13
William B. McKoy's egal business. The corres-

pondence is especially extensive for the 1890's.
Many letters concern routine legal affairs, but
there are a number of other significant topics.
McKoy was a trustee of the North Carolina Agri-
cultural and Mechanical College for the Colored
Race at Greensboro when it was organized early

in the 1890's; the school is now the Agricultura
and Technical College of North Carolina. Eleven
letters, 1892-1895, relate to the college, and

the page numbers are cited on the subject entry

 
McKoy, William Berr 14
card. See the following subject entry cards

for page references to other notable topics:
Building and Loan Associations; N.C., New Han-
over County, Politics and Government, 1894-1907;
Insurance Laws and Regulations, N.C., 1900-1901;
Taxation, N.C., 1899; Prohibition Movement, N.C.
1908; Political Parties, Democratic, N.C., 1907-
1908; and N.C., Politics and Government, 1899-
1908. McKoy was an attorney and director of the
Mechanics Home Association and may have been in-
volved with other building and loan companies.

 

 
McKoy, William Berry 15
He was interested in genealogy, and records of
his and other families appear in the volume and
are noted in the Subject File.

The Checkbook, 1889-1891, apparently belonged
to the Peoples Perpetual Building and Loan
Association of Wilmington. Im at least one case
(No. 40), W.B. McKoy has made a notation beside
a transaction. The company’s stamp has been
used in the book, and a number of payments in-
volved A.S. Robinson.

A letter of Jan. 19, 1894, identified A.S.

Robinson as secretary of the Peoples Perpetual

 

 
McKoy, William Berry 16
Building and Loan Association. This letter and
three other documents of the company are filed
witha Daybook, 1894, where they were found.
Their presence inside the volume might connect
Robinson with the butcher establishment for
which the daybook was kept. The daybook is not
labeled, and its owner or owners and Robinson

 

cannot yet be identified.
1 vol. added, 7-21-66: This notebook is
identified with Dr. William A. Berry by the
inclusion of promissory notes addressed to

 
McKoy, William Berry 17

 

him by two different persons in 1865 and 1566,
and his name can be discerned on the outside
of one cover. One page has a copy of a legal
document from Wilmington, N. C. City
directories for Wilmington list Berry as a
physician. He was William Augustus Berry
(1804-1875), the grandfather of William Berry
McKoy, and genealogical information about him
appears in the latter's Letterpress Book,
1889-1915, p. 224.

The notebook consists primarily of medical

 
McKoy, William Berry 18

 

prescriptions for specific diseases. However,
there are a variety of other memoranda, such

as directions for liquor, whitewash, fertilizer,
dental work, marble, horse medicine, crop
planting, etc. A few items are dated during th
1860's and early 1870's.

49 items added, 3-16-67. Francis Henry
Bacon (1856-1940) was the brother-in-law of
William B. McKoy. While a young man, he was a
member of the expedition of 1881-1883 that the
Archeological Institute of America sent to

excavate the site of the ancient Greek city of

 
McKoy, William Berry 19
Assos in Asia Minor. The account of this
expedition was published in Francis Henry Bacon,
ed., Investigations at ASSOS .e. (Cambridge,
Mass., 1902-} 152L), 2 vols. The typescripts*of
his forty-nine letters of 1881-1883 record his

life at Assos and provide glimpses of the
archeological work and of the personnel who

 

performed it. Members of the expedition in-
cluded: Joseph Thacher Clarke, Charles Howard
Walker, and Maxwell Wrigley, architects;
William C. Lawton and Charles W. Bradley,
graduates of Harvard; J. H. Haynes, graduate of

*lriginal letters
added, 11-15-67.

 
McKoy, William Berry 20
Williams College; Joseph Silas Diller, geo Logists
and for 1881 only, Eliot Norton, lawyer. Edward
Robinson, later an art director, was nearby at
Mytilene. In 1882 Robert Koldewey of Germany
joined the group. Bacon traveled in the region
of Mytilene, Smyrna, and the sites of Sardis
and Troy. He also visited Athens (1883), Italy
(1882), and other places in Europe. The letters
also contain information about his immediate
relatives of whom Henry Bacon (1866-1924), the
noted architect, was a brother.

Francis H. Bacon's original letters from the

 

 
McKoy, William Berry tM
Assos Expedition were added to the collection
on Nov. 15, 1967. They include a number of
small drawings that depict personnel, local
inhabitants, and scenes. There is a color
sketch of a view from Mt. Assos in the letter
of Oct. 15, 1881.

2 items added, 11-15-67. Two of Bacon's

 

letters are from his European trip in 1878. In
July he was in England, and in Sept. he traveled
through Belgium. These items were not dupli-
cated by the earlier acquisition of transcripts
as were the Assos letters.

Macky, John

Mr. Macky Persuant to the Direction of Her
Royal Highness the Princess Sophia, Published
from His Original Manuscript, As Attested by
His Son, Spring Macky, Bsq. (London, 1733).

It was, according to the Dictionary of National
Biography, “a somewhat important contribution
to contemporary history" that was valuable for

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its "descriptions of the leading personages of

the period, which evidence both keen powers of

observation and great impartiality of judgment."
That portion of the work entitled Characters

 

 
Macky, John a
of the Court of Great Britain, concise biog-
raphies of public men, was written in about
1703-1704. Macky noted the dismissal of Sir
Edward Seymour (April, 1704) as occurring
"since the writing these characters." This
remark also appears in the biography of the
Earl of Jersey who left office in 1704. Other
men, Sir Nathan Wright and the Duke of Bucking-
ham, were described as still in office; they
left in 1705. The biographies were written
after Queen Anne came to the throne in 1702.

 

 

 
Macky, John 4
Tieir information extends back into the period
of the Restoration. The careers, politics,
personalities, and appearance of the various
individuals are described.

An undated manuscript volume (238 pp.)
entitled "The Court and Kingdom of England" is
a copy of the Characters of the Court of Great

 

 

 

Britain. The manuscript is one of several
copies that exist or have been known to exist.
Considerable information about Macky, his book,
and the manuscripts appears in The Times

 
Macky, John Nite
Literary Supplement (June 14, 21, 28, July 5,
1928, and Aug. 13, 20, 1938). In 1928

William Arthur Shaw, historian, noted five
manuscripts: his copy purchased some ten years
earlier; the British Museum's Harleian MS.
4635; the Bodleian Library's Tanner MS. 206;

a copy in the Tixall Library sale of 1899;

and one owned by Mr. Macfie of Liverpool in
1900. The copy in this collection was not

used for the publication of 1733, because there
are innumerable differences in spelling,

 

 

 
Macky, John 6
wording, and arrangement. Occasionally there
are significant variations, such as the printed
version's additions of "lusty" and "something
of a Libertine" to the biographies of Lord
Cutts and Lord Somers, respectively. The
manuscript resembles Shaw's insofar as he
described it (TLS, June 14, 1928, p. 449),
except that his copy had a biography of "Robert,
Earl of Leicester" that is here entitled
"Robert Sidney, Earl of Leicester." The
characteristics of the Macfie and Tixall copies

 

 
Macky, John 7
were not described in the TLS, but there was a
reference to a sale catalog for the latter.

The manuscript is probably a clerical tran-
script. There are a few marginal comments of
a later date,
