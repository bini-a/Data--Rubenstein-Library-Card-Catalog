This collection is comprised of a type-
script of the diary of Mary Sarah (Bell)
Perkins, wife of William Robertson Perkins,
and of photographs of paintings by Douglas
Chandor of the Perkinses, and of a photograph
of Thomas Benjamin Moore Perkins, father of
W. R. The paintings and photograph are in the
possession of Mrs. Clark N. Barton of El
Dorado, Arkansas. See also the William

 
Perkins, Mary Sarah (Bell) 2

 

Robertson Perkins Papers in this department.
Mrs. Perkins' diary runs from January l,
1932, to June 23, 1941. There is no indica-
tion as to why it stopped on that date. Each
entry in the diary is brief and factual and
seldom mentions a public event. The entries

usually begin with a comment on the weather
and continue with mention of the Perkins
children, some of their activities, births of
grandchildren, frequent visits from and with
their three children, grandchildren, and

 
Perkins, Mary Sarah (Bell)

 

friends. Their children were William R.
Perkins, Jr., Thomas Lee, and Mary Clough.
According to the genealogy compiled by William
R. Perkins that is in his collection in a
folder labeled "Ancestors and Descendants,"
William R., Jr. married Mrs. Margaret Kaye
Wynne-Wynne, Thomas married Dorothy Morgan,

and Mary married Charles Nylic Barton, son of

Col. Thomas H. Barton, founder and president

of the Lion Oil Company of El Dorado, Ark.
Mrs. Perkins usually mentioned her guests

 
Perkins, Mary Sarah (Bell) 4

 

and bridge-playing friends only by their sur-
names. For example, she always referred to
her close friend Mrs. David Henney as Mrs.
Henney. She referred to her husband as Mr.
Perkins, Dad, or Papa. The Perkinses main-
tained an apartment in New York, and frequent-

ly Mrs. Perkins would write that her husband
had remained in the city for the night, or
that he had worked late, or was on a trip to
North Carolina, Washington, or elsewhere. As
a member of the legal staff of the American

 
Perkins, Mary Sarah (Bell) 5

 

Tobacco Company until it was dissolved, then
counsel for the P. Lorillard Company, personal
counsel of James B.-and Benjamin N. Duke,
executor and trustee of their estates, and
thereby involved in the building of Duke Uni-
versity, and head of the firm of Perkins,

Daniels & Perkins, he doubtless was an exceed-
ingly hardworking attorney.

The diary entries of Mrs. Perkins also men-
tion shopping, social, cultural, and church
activities, trips, and gardening while she

 
Perkins, Mary Sarah (Bell) 7 | 6

 

lived in New York state and New Jersey. Once
the Perkinses moved in 1937 to a farm, which
they named "Rocklawn,". eleven miles out of
Lynchburg on the Holcomb Rock Road leading to
Natural Bridge her entries frequently recorded
helping the cook with preserving and canning,
work being done on the farm, and landscaping
the yard. The social activities she frequently
spoke of were usually visits by relatives and
friends and men associated with Duke University
and The Duke Endowment. She reported no

 
Perkins, Mary Sarah (Bell) 7

 

conversations with their guests.

Some specific diary entries are as follows:
Oct. 20, 1932, W. R. Perkins delivered an ad-
dress to the Bar Association at Duke; Nov. 8,
1932, the Perkins family all voted for Herbert
Hoover; on Nov. 30, 1932, the Perkinses cele-

brated their 30th wedding anniversary; Jan. 18,
1934, Mrs. Perkins went to see the Meister-
singer for the benefit of the Southern Women's
Educational Alliance; June 2, 1934, Mr. Perkins
went to Spartanburg to deliver the Commencement

 
Perkins, Mary Sarah (Bell) 8

address at Wofford College; Jan. 7, 1935, Mrs.
Perkins attended a meeting at Mrs. Hagemeyer's
of the Southern Women's Educational Alliance;

Apr. 9, Mr. Perkins spoke at Davidson College;
June 2 he attended Commencement at Duke; Sept.
19, David Henney died; Jan. 25, 1936, "Al

 

Smith delivered a fine radio address"; Sept. 3
Mr. Perkins went to Durham to attend the fu-
neral of Mrs. Benjamin Newton Duke; Feb. 11,
1937, the Perkinses moved from Montclair to
"Rocklawn"; Feb. 11, 1938, Mr. Perkins won the

 
Perkins, Mary Sarah (Bell) 9

 

P. Lorillard case; June 24, Alfred, the
chauffeur, drove Mrs. Perkins to Durham for the
wedding of Mary Biddle and Dr. Josiah C. Trent
which is described briefly; Apr. 21, 1939, Mr.
Perkins drove to Durham for the opening of the
Centennial of Duke University; June 8, Thomas
L. Perkins graduated from the Law School of

the University of Virginia with high marks.
The record from 1937 to 1941 of the relation-
ship between the Perkinses and Mary Biddle
Trent, granddaughter of B. N. Duke, and her

 
Perkins, Mary Sarah (Bell) 10

 

first husband, Dr. Trent, reveals a close
friendship between them.

In summary the diary of Mrs. Perkins is a
portrayal in outline of life within her family
after the Perkins children are grown, the
absorption of her husband for his profession,
and of her life style as an upper middle class

woman.

Judge William Robertson Perkins (1875-1945),
counsel for James Buchanan Duke, executor of
his will, and Trustee of the Duke Endowment, is
represented by a letter on the relation of a
university (Duke) and its president (W. P. Few)

to students. This copy comes from an original
letter to Judge Perkins to be found in the
William Preston Few Papers.

In the settlement of Item IV of the will of

 
Perkins, William Robertson 2
James B. Duke, a major role was played by
Judge Perkins as executor. His son, Thomas
L. Perkins, sent to the Perkins Library a
clipping from the Philadelphia Evening Public
Ledger, Oct. 10, 1928, in which Judge Perkins
and Charles Evans Hughes are pictured during
the final hearings on the settlement of the
Duke estate under Item IV. In the James Buch-
anan Duke Papers are many letters and legal
papers concerning the court battles in this

settlement.

Perkins, William Robertson 4

 

William Robertson Perkins (1875-1945), attor-
ney, practiced law in New York City for forty
years. After a boyhood and early years as an
attorney in Lynchburg, Virginia, he became, in
1913, personal legal counselor to James B. Duke
and the Duke families. Perkins was a member of
the law firm of Perkins and Daniels, which later
became Perkins, Daniels, and Perkins when
Perkins' son Thomas L. joined the firm. He drew

 
Perkins, William Robertson 5
the wills of James B. and Benjamin N. Duke and
acted as executor of both their estates. Perkins
business connection with the Duke interests kept
him in close touch with the affairs of Duke
University. He drafted the indenture for the
Duke Endowment and then served as trustee and
vice chairman of the Endowment. As a result of

 

his link with James B. Duke, Perkins was active
in hydroelectric power development in Canada.
He was both a director and counselor to the
American Cyanamid Company, and also served as

a director and vice president of the Duke

 
Perkins, William Robertson 6
Power Company in the Carolinas. Further bio-
graphical information is contained in Box l.
The Alphabetical Files comprise the entire
collection of thousands of legal papers (1903-
1945) representing state and federal tax liti-
gation of the Duke families, the George D.
Haskell suit against the Aluminum Company of

 

America, and the Haskell suit against the Duke
estate. Note that several suits were carried on
simultaneously in separate state and federal
courts, thus there appear to be overlapping,

 
Perkins, William Robertson. 7

 

inclusive dates.

There are estate tax litigation papers for
Angier, Benjamin, Doris, James, and Nanaline
Duke from eight states and the federal govern-
ment (Boxes 1-11). Particularly detailed to
show the Duke family holdings in stocks and

bonds are the New Jersey, New York, and federal
estate tax cases (1925-1934), which involved
the Doris Duke trust, Duke Farms Company (a
personal holding company which James Duke or-
ganized), and the Duke Power Company (Boxes 6-

7).
e

 
Perkins, William Robertson 8

 

On July 13, 1931, there was a decision for
the Duke estate before the U.S. Board of Tax
Appeals, which the Board appealed. Perkins then
won the Duke estate federal tax case in the 3rd
Circuit Board of Appeals on January 10, 1933.
The Board took the case to the U.S. Supreme
Court. Finally, and again under Perkins' lead-

ership, on October 23, 1933 federal taxes of

$9,000,000 assessed against the Duke estate

were disallowed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The ALCOA Chronology file (Box 11) is a

 
Perkins, William Robertson

 

guide to most of the events leading to the
Haskell suits against ALCOA (Boxes 11-20).
George D. Haskell, a small businessman from
Massachusetts, claimed that there was a joint
venture with James B. Duke in early 1924 to
establish an aluminum enterprise on the Sangue-

nay River in Quebec, that Duke broke this agree
ment by "selling out" to ALCOA, and that the
Haskell suit was an attempt to recover for gaing
from Duke. Haskell alleged he would have made
these gains had his agreement with Duke been

 
Perkins, William Robertson 10

 

realized. The Haskell suit for $15 million
damages against the Duke estate began in 1926
in a New Jersey District Court and ended in the
U.S. Supreme Court in favor of the Duke estate
in 1929 (Boxes 20-21). Throughout the litiga-
tion teams of lawyers were guided by the coun-
sel of Perkins from either New York or Lynch-
burg.

Evident throughout the papers is the business
acumen of James B. Duke, Perkins, George
Garland Allen, Arthur Vining Davis, George D.

 
Perkins, William Robertson ya

Haskell, and William States Lee. Many of their
Signed letters are included. Also in the pa-
pers are newspaper articles in 1925 on James B.
Duke's proposed extension of the Piedmont &
Northern Railway from Charlotte to Winston-
Salem, as well as on building the connecting

 

link between Gastonia and Spartanburg, South
Carolina, a matter which would cost from twelve
to fifteen million dollars (Box 7).

Included in the Perkins files (Boxes 22-25)
at the end of the collection are his early caseg

 
Perkins, William Robertson ee

 

with the British-American Tobacco Company and
the P., Lorillard Company litigation. Also, a
volume consists of an "Abstract of Title to the
Proposed Site of the Jamestown Exposition."
This abstract was presented to Judge Perkins in
1938 in a silver canister. The abstract is

signed by Theodore J. Wool and O.D. Batchelor,
General Counsel for the Jamestown Exposition
Company, and dated March 10, 1904. With the
abstract is Wool's letter to Perkins on April
18, 1938, in which he reveals that Perkins had

 
Perkins, William Robertson pe

compiled the abstract and that it had been pre-
served by Wool since the close of the Exposition
in 1907. A signed copy of Perkins' reply also
appears in the collection.

Also in the Perkins files are papers of a
personal nature such as an itemization of

 

Perkins' estate in two ledgers as well as a
detailed genealogical study of his ancestors
and descendants from 1656 to 1943. Other vol-
umes are leather-bound memorial resolutions
adopted in memory of Judge Perkins by the

Kent, England

 

This collection consists principally of a
scrapbook including correspondence, reproduc-
tions of engravings, poetry, autographs, a
pencil drawing, and an account of astrological
incidents.

The correspondence contained in the scrap-
book is related to the Perronet family and
other early leaders of the Wesleyan movement
in England. There are seven letters from
Vincent Perronet, a Wesleyan minister, to his

 
Perronet Family. 2
children and grandchildren. In a letter to

his granddaughter, Charity Briggs, Perronet
stated his doctrine of the atonement (p. 5).

He wrote his son Charles and daughter Damaris
and compared self-discipline with the discipline
a minister must exercise over his congregation
(p. 7). In a second letter to them he told of
an incident in which a Wesleyan was denied the
sacrament at an Anglican church (p. 9). His
other letters concern family matters and advice
to his children on such issues as dancing and

social conformity.

 

 
Perronet Family

A letter possibly written by John Perronet,
son of Vincent Perronet, discusses the philos-
ophy of John Locke (p. 21). The writer of this
letter defended Locke's views against the
attacks of John Hildrop, an Anglican clergyman,
and Robert Clayton, Anglican Bishop of Cork
and Ross and later Bishop of Clogher.

The scrapbook also contains three letters
from John Wesley to the Rev. Peard Dickinson,
a Wesleyan minister who married Elizabeth
Briggs, granddaughter of Vincent Perronet
(p. 23). Wesley argued against the practice of

 

 
Perronet Family 4
consecrating ground for burial plots. He also indicated
his hopes for maintaining and strengthening the ties
between the Dickinson and Wesley families. Ina se-
cond letter Wesley discussed the spiritual life of

Sammy Wesley. He also mentions that though his eye-
Sight remained impaired, his health had generally im-

 

proved (p. 25). The third letter is a letter of
condolence to Dickinson concerning the death of a
member of Dickinson's family (p. 27).

In a letter to William Perronet, Vincent
Perronet's son, Charles Wesley encouraged young

 
Perronet Family La
Perronet to practice daily devotions (P. 33).
Wesley later wrote Perronet a letter in which
he discussed their mutual acquaintances and his
poor health (p. 31). He mentioned his health
again in a letter to Betsy Briggs (Elizabeth
Briggs Dickinson) and discussed the meaning of
death (p. 35).

 

Sarah Wesley wrote Mrs. Dickinson about the
merits of liturgical simplicity and the super-
ficiality of elaborate ritual (p. 85).

In three letters to Dickinson, Joseph
Benson, a leading Wesleyan minister, considered

 
Perronet Family 6
the problems besetting English Methodists
during the years just following the death of
John Wesley in 1791. He noted that he had
gained much from reading Joseph Milner's
History of the Church of Christ and that though
he understood that the Christian Church has
chronically been troubled by internal disagree-

 

 

ment, he could nevertheless feel discouraged
about the situation obtaining in the Methodist
Church in England (p. 65). He later saw some
hope for an agreement (p. 67), but a few months
afterward he stated that he doubted if the

 
Perronet Family 7
marty Methodist groups would ever be united
(p. 69).

Letters of numerous other Methodist leaders
are also contained in the scrapbook. Ina
letter to an unidentified friend, Adam Clarke
discussed the English edition of Christoph
Christian Sturm's Reflections on the Works of

 

 

God and His Providence which he had edited
(p. 83). Included in this letter is a draft
of the advertisement for the new edition,
Other letters relating to the Perronet family
or British Methodism are by the Wesleyan

 

 
Perronet Family 8
leaders James Dixon (p. 73), Joseph Entwisle
(p. 81), John William and Mary (Bosanquet)
Fletcher (pp. 37-41), Thomas Jackson (p. 91),
Henry Moore ( p. 79), and Richard Watson (p.89).
There are engravings of John Wesley ( p. 22),
Vincent Perronet (p. 3), and Joseph Benson
(p. 65) and a pencil drawing of William
Perronet (p. 13). An account, ‘presumably
written by Vincent Perronet, describes two
mysterious appearances of a bright star soon
fallowed by deaths in the community (p. 19).
Several poems are included (pp. 2,3,18, and

 

 
Perronet Family )
loose), as is a printed version of the last
words of Charles Wesley (p. 31). An undated
newspaper clipping gives an obituary notice
and short biography of Edith Thompson, great-
great-granddaughter of Vincent Perronet,.

Among the loose items are a short discourse
on man's need for religious conversion, which,

 

according to Vincent Perronet, was written by
his son Charles; two diaries kept by an un-
identified young lady who commented on sermons,
prayer meetings, her spiritual development, and
the daily life of a devout family; and

miscellaneous letters and autographs.

This material consists chiefly of indentures

and other legal documents, together with a few
letters. The family apparently resided in
Franklin County as early as the Revolutionary
period. Most of the information concerning

 

the family is provided in the will of Jeremiah
Perry (1838). Therein he left 83 slaves and
a unknown quantity of land to his wife, Temper-

ance, and their ten children, Nathan, Bennett,

addition to this each of the children had,

Various members of the family figure in

the documents, The scattered evidence,
though, leads to the conclusion that the
family were large planters, with, probably,

over a hundred

slaves, and hundreds, if not thousands of

acres of land. The numerous indentures

indicate heavy investment in lands, and probably
speculation. The few letters are too scattered
to add much information concerning the family.

Historical Sketch
Perry was born in Pendleton District in
1805, and died at Greenville, 8. C. in 1886.

He was educated at Asheville, N.C., and was
admitted to the bar in 1827. His bold attack
thrvough the Greenville Mountaineer made him
a leader of the Union Party in 8.C. From 1836-
1844 he was in Congress where he diligently

labored for the Union cause. In 1850 he

 
 

Perr B. F. 2
established the Southern Patriot and through

it appealed to the South CUarolinians to re-
main loyal to the Union. When S. C. withdrew
in 1861, he sent his sons to the Confederate
army. In 1865 he was appointed provisional
governor.

The letters of this collection are ade¢:
dressed to Armistead Burt of Abbeville, 8.C.
The sequestration of property in 1863, the
formation of Civil Rights Bills, and private
law suits are discussed in the letters.

The life of Thomas Sergeant Perry (1845-1528),
minor American critic, covers almost the identical
of years with that of the great English critic
Saintsbury (1645-1933) and of the novelist
(1840-1925). In our own country, he was
younger than his close friends, William Dean Howells
and Henry James. Thus he lived and. wrote letters
the middle years of the Victorian period, or from

re-Civil war years through the swift political

erary upheavals of the 1920's. The letters which

hood letters sent by Henry L . and Wilkinson

for safety, and the Russo-Japanese war was threatening

the United States, and he makes frequent references

High Point, N.C. 937 pieces 1900)

 

This set gives lttle information about Ves-
tah W. Perry's family, with the exception that
he had a brother Jonathan Perry, and a married
Sister, Samira Folger. Perry himself was evid-
ently a small scale farmer, with very little ed-

ucation. Besides farming he operated a whiskey
distillery and a countyy store. He also served
as Justice of the Peace,

key distillery, some notes concerning the byying
of fertilizer, and some smatterings of informa-
tion regarding farm conditons, prices etc. in
Missouri and Indiana for the years 18866-1886.
Many of the papers consist of cancelled notes

given by tobacco farmers in order to obtain fer=
tilizer.

 

1 item added 12-21-60: A letter to Perry
from A.J. Folger, husband of Perry's sister
Samira (May-16, 1859). Folger discussed the
poor economic conditions in Indiana as well as
various family matters.

 
Perry, Vestal W. ee 3

7 items added, 10-25-71: These are primarily
letters between friends and various relatives
of the Perry family. That family may have been
Quaker in faith since one letter, written to
Ebenezer Perry on May 31, 1847, is phrased in
the Quaker "style," and another letter, written
to Vestal W. Perry and dated January, 1857,
speaks of a mutual acquaintance who was reared
as a Quaker. There is also a phrenological
chart of Jonathan Perry that was made in 1856.

Peruvian Collection

 

This heterogenous collection of manuscripts
is primarily from the colonial period of Peru,
but there is also material from the 19th
century. These papers concern a considerable
variety of topics from the economic, social,

political, administrative, religious, and
literary history of Peru and occasionally of
nearby countries. For detailed information
about each manuscript see the guide to the col-
lection that is in the Inventory File. The

 

 

 

 
Peruvian Collection 2

 

descriptions of each manuscript includes both
an English and a Spanish version.

This guide to the collection is the result
of extensive recataloging in which, for the
first time, considerable attention has been
given to analyzing the content of the manu-

scripts. The descriptions of many of the manu-
scripts have been enlarged, and, in some cases,
author and title information has been changed
or refined. Many entries have been added to
the card catalog based upon these new

 
Peruvian Collection
descriptions. Copies of these cards have been
included in the guide in order to provide
additional means of access to the contents of
the collection.

Some of these manuscripts, formerly the
property of Manuel de Odriozola, the Peruvian

 

literary historian who brought together this
collection, are listed in the Catalogo de la
Biblioteca Peruana Propiedad de Dn. Francisco
Perez de Velasco (Lima, 1918). Rubén Vargas

Peters, Don Preston, Sr. Papers, 1952.
Lynchburg, Campbell Co., Va.

 

This small collection is the remains of a
once very extensive collection originally
known as the Don Preston Peters Collection.
The latter collection actually consisted of
many groups of papers which were amassed over

a period of years by the late Dr. Don Preston
Peters, Sr., @ prominent Lynchburg surgeon
and philatelist. The lack of uniformity in
the quality of these papers is due partially
to the fact that his chief interest was

 
Peters, Don Preston, Sr. 2
acquiring stamps, not manuscripts. The papers
deal mainly with Virginia and Virginians, and
particularly with Lynchburg and its
inhabitants. Since the papers comprise

many individual collections, or additions to
collections already housed in thid department,
they have been treated as such.

 

The remaining two items are a list of
the entire contents of the Peters Collection
acquired by Duke University and a clipping

from the Lynchburg News, Nov. 9, 1952, which

 
Peters, Don Preston, Sr. 3
contains an article by Martha Rivers Adams,
dealing with William Weaver, the Don Preston
Peters Collection, etc.

Don Preston Peters, Sr. was descended from
four governors of Va. His father was Elisha
Peters (1829-1906), Confederate Col. and
Professor of Latin in the Univ. of Va., from

 

1866 to 1902. See the latter's Latin Case
Relations (1885), the bound manuscript volume
of a book, later published and widely used, in
this department. He married Margaret Sheffey
in 1858 and then Mary Sheffey on July 14,1873.

 
Peters, Don Preston, Sr. 4

Don Preston Peters, Sr..was born of the latter
union in Marion on July 14, 1877. He attended
the University of Va., receiving his B. A. and
M. A. in 1899 and his M. D. in 1902. He

practiced surgery in Baltimore, Md., from 1911
to 1917. He married Rhett Mencke in Balthmore

 

on Oct. 28, 1911. To this union were born four
children: Mary Sheffey; Don Preston, Jr.; John
Lyon; and Rhett Preston. He served in the
Medical Corps, Army of the U. 8. (1917-1919),
both in the U. S. and in France, beginning as

a lgt 1t. and ending ‘6 Maj. In 1919 he began

 
Peters, Don Preston, Sr. 5

to practice surgery in Lynchburg, becoming a
well-known man in his field. He contributed
articles to medical journals, belonged to vari-
ous professional and other organizations, and
was a Democrat and Presbyterian.

Peterson, Elisha 4, Papers. 1862-1865.
Springdale, Hamilton Co., Ohio.

 

This collection contains the letters of
Elisha A. Peterson, a private in the 4th
Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, Company D, Army of the
Cumberland, and his father,Jacob S. Peterson
of Springdale, Hamilton Co., Ohio.

E. A. Peterson spent the major part of his
three years in the Union Army (1862-1865)
serving in Tennessee. In his letters, he
discusses his personal experiences, the

Condition of the Army in general and describes

 
Peterson, Elisha A.

 

camp life at his various posts in central
Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. Among the
battles that Peterson describes are
Murfreesboro (Jan., 1863) and Chattanooga
(Sept., 1863).

Peterson served at the staff headquarters
under Generals D. S. Stanley and W. S. Rose-

crans. He especially liked Rosecrans and felt
that U. S. Grant, Rosecrans' successor, would
have to prove his ability before he could win
the respect of the soldiers who remembered

Rosecrans as their leader (Oct. 27, 1863).

 
Peterson, Elisha A. i

 

On Sept. 24, 1864, Peterson wrote his
family telling them of the fall of Atlanta,
Sherman's strategy, and the conditions in
Atlanta following Sherman's victory.

On Feb. 18, 1865, he wrote from Gravelly
Spring, Ala., about the Huston family, a pro-
Union family in Lauderdale Co. in north-
western Alabama,

Elisha Peterson discuased pro-Southern
sympathies in Kentucky, and Jacob Peterson
described for his son the activities of the
butternuts and copperheads in Ohio. The

 
Peterson, Elisha A. 4,
elder Peterson praised Henry Winter Davis and
Gov. Oliver H. P. T. Morton of Indiana for
their efforts to defeat the southern sympathizers
in the Lower Middle West.

In a letter dated June 10, 1863, Elisha
Peterson told his family about the punishment
given three Union Army offenders, a thief, a
mutineer, and a deserter. He also mentioned
the impending execution of several Confederate
spies, one of whom was a woman.

Jacob Peterson told his son of a

conspiracy to release the Confederate prisoners

 

 
Peterson, Elisha A, Ss.

 

held on Johnson's Island in Sandusky Bay, Ohio.
This plot appears to be similar to that of John
Yates Beall, but Beall's activities took place
in the autumn of 1864 while Peterson's letter
is dated Nov. 17, 1863.

4, 1822, and a letter to William George Read
of Baltimore asking Read to attend to some

 
Petigru Family 2
business for a Mrs. Kohne of Philadelphia
(Apr. 27, 1842).

Charles Petigru's papers consist of letters
from his sister Adele, wife of Robert Francis
Withers Allston, and Jane, his brother Tom
(Thomas ?), and from two friends in Maryland.
These letters are for the most part personal

 

in nature, though a letter of Aug. 12, 1833,
contains a good description of White Sulphur
Springs, W.Va. The James Louis Petigru and
Charles Petigru collections were combined when
they were recataloged on this date.

Sumterville, Alad. Family Letters

 

In general this collection contains
family letters of ordinary type, though
there are two that discuss the Nullifi-
cation question of S. C. to considerable
extent. Those letters dealing with

Nullification were written by Josfeph] H.
Pettigrew of S. C. and R. H. Pettigrew of
Hibernia[ S. C. ]? in 1833 to their

brother, Ebenezer Pettigrew of Sumterville,
Sumter county, Ala.

 
Pettigrew, Ebenezer Sketch (2)
Sumterville, Ala. Family Letters

The name is spelled Pettigru by the
brothers writing from S. C. , but usually
in the series of letters it 1s spelled

Pettigrew. It is possible that there is
a close connection between these Alabama

Pettigrfyés and the zPettigrwe family of
Nf @hich Gen. James Johnston Pettigrew
was a member. The N. C. family was

connected with James Louis Petigru of S. C.
and the name Ebenezer was also the name

 
PETTIGREW, Ebenezer. Sketch. (3)
of a N.C. Pettigrew who was a congressman in

1835. It seems a likely assumption that some of
the Pettigrew family of Abbeville, S.C. moved to
Ala., though no such fact is revealed in the MSS.
In fact Ebenezer Pettigrew, the chief character
of this collection, seems very likely to have
been the founder of the family in Ala. At any

 

 

rate Eliza Pettigrew of Greensborough, Ala., Ebe
nezer Pettigrew of Green Co., Ala., and Joseph
Pettigrew and R. H. Pettigrew of §.C. were

brothers and sisters.

These are mainly family letters of the Petty,

pondence begins in 1860. The families seem to
be originally from Virginia but were divided by

the time of the Civil War, although they kept
in contact throughout. Little of consequence
is said in the Civil War letters. After the
war's end there are some interesting letters

The only significant part of this col-
lection is the diary. It .is charmingly and
amusingly written, containing excellent de-
scriptions of all the author sees. Phelps,
an old "Charterhouse Man" (an English Public

 

School) crosses the North Atlantic in July,
1892, .He stops at Quebec. and then goes on
by ship to Montreal; from there by train to
Owen Sound, stopping for several days at

Toronto. He takes a lake steamer from Owen
Sound, crossing “oe and Superior to

 
Phelps, Murray r?, N, 2
Port Arthur. There he boards a train for
Winntpeg, where he stayed for some days, being
pleasantly entertained by people of prominence
to whom he has letters of introduction.

Phelps often mentions the sports he sees:
particularly tennis, but cricket, track,

 

lacrosse,polo, horse racing, hunting, and
baseball are also mentioned. He graphically
describes Bishop's Court, the "oldest house

in Manitoba." He then takes a train for

Ducks Station, stopping on the way for a night
at Banff Hot wie oe gives wonderful

 
Phelps, Murray ,.?3 N, t)
descriptions of the Rocky Mountains as he sees
them in his travels.

He gives an amusing account of his arrival
at Ducks Station and the night spent in a
"frontier hotel," and his wagon trip to Warwick
Ranch at Grande Prairie. He stays at the

 

ranch about a month, spending the time riding
and hunting. His descriptions of ranch life
and hunting trips are excellent.

He goes by train to Vancouver. As there
is a smallpox epidemic at Victoria, all train
passengers have to “oe of recent vac-

 
Phelps, Murray cf, N, 4
Cination or be vaccinated on the train. Phelps
stops at Vancouver for a few days, and then
goes by paddle steamer to Victoria, where he
stays for several weeks. Phelps has his usual
letters of introduction, and is accepted and
entertained by local society. He makes friends

 

with a well-educated Chinaman, and becomes
very familiar with Victoria's "Chinatown."
Phelps starts his eastward trip by visit-
ing New Westminster, which he describes
beautifully. The diary ends here, but there
are several inserted which give the

Phillips, Anna Jones (Dunn). Papers. Boston,
Suffolk Co., Mass.

 

Anna Jones (Dunn) Phillips was the widow of
Thomas Walley Phillips (1797-1859). According
to Joseph Palmer's Necrology of Alumni of Harvard
College, 1851-52 to 1862-63, he graduated from

 

Harvard in 1814, practised law very success-
fully in Boston for about fourteen years, and
then became clerk of the Municipal Court. He
had several sisters and brothers, and one of his
brothers was the noted orator and reformer

 
Phillips, Anna Jones (Dunn)

 

Wendell Phillips.

The diary begins on Jan. 1, 1861, and ends
on Dec. 31 of that year with Mrs. Phillips in
Brooklyn, New York, visiting friends and re-
latives. It contains 62 pages of diary entries
and 14 pages of financial accounts and entries.

There is an entry for every day of that year,
but, except for a number of comments about the
excitement accompanying the outbreak of the
Civil War, the volunteering of troops, mob
activity attributed to citizens of Baltimore

 
Phillips, Anna Jones (Dunn)

 

that included destroying portions of the rail-
road between that city and Philadelphia and be-
tween Baltimore and Washington, the First Battle
of Manassas, and the capture of Mason and Slidell
and their imprisonment in Fort Warren in Boston
Harbor, there is little in the diary other than

a consistent description of the weather, her
health, the health of relatives and other ac-
quaintances, deaths among her acquaintances, her
church attendance, her son Samuel, and her

 
Phillips, Anna Jones (Dunn) 4
frequent visiting. She owned a summer home at
Nahant, but it appears that she boarded when she
was living in Boston in the winter of 1861.

She says little about her domestic activities.
Numerous people, including a number of ministers,
are mentioned in the diary.

 

A few times Mrs. Phillips mentions the
Missionary Society of St. Paul's Episcopal Churc
of which she was a member, and also that church'
Association for the Relief of the Industrious
Poor, of which she was also a member. She did

 
Phillips, Anna Jones (Dunn) 5

 

some sewing and knitting for the soldiers, but
little is said about that. When her son wanted
to take a commission in a volunteer regiment she
said that it was not his duty to enlist and that
she could not give her consent. According to
the Necrology of Alumni of Harvard he graduated
from there in 1861 and in March, 1862, offered
his services to the Educational Commission to
work with the blacks at Port Royal, S.C. Before
he had served as superintendent there for one
year he became ill and died on Dec. 5, 1862, at

Raiders (U. S.) defeated the few Confederate
defenders and captured the city on Sunday after-
noon, April 2, 1865. The Raiders were composed
at least in part, of released convicts. C. S.
Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest is mentioned, but he
does not appear on the scene to prevent the

 

Yankee atrocities. A refugee from New Orleans,
a venerable old gentleman, was hanged to a
bedpost without his body's being rescued from t
flames. The women and children of Selma were
unprotected from the vandals.

Most of the story focuses upon the McIlwain

to flee to Perry Co. to keep from being killed.
A U.S. Army Capt. and some of his men inva-
ded the Mcllwain home and ransacked it looking
for gold, silver, and food. Sarah told him
that her mother had given all the meat in the

smokehouse to some Confederate Soldiers the day
before. The Capt. threatened to burn the fin
house and the regular house and to kill Mrs.
McIlwain. She gave him two pieces of silver.

He made a sarcastic remark about Sarah and then,
surprisingly, asked her mother to pray for him.

Mrs. Mctlwain did SO, whereupon he apologized
and departed, but, did not return the money.

For a week the Raiders depredated Selma.
One Negro was robbed. The McIlwain's slaves were
devoted to them throughout.

William Horace Phillips was the son of Charles
M. Phillips and Sarah G. (Crowder) Phillips.
Charles Phillips_was an overseer, apparently
well established in his occupation. The son,

 

William H. was about to enter the same business
when the Civil War began. There was a younger
son, "Morty," who was about twelve years old

in 1861. arah Phillips wasapparently illiterate

but the son William gave evidence of having

received a reasonable amount of education, while
"Morty" apparently had little inclination for
school.

William H. Phillips apparently volunteered,
and served the Yonfeteracy throughout the war,

so far as the letters reveal, without being
wounded, and with only one minor illness. The
letters do not reveal just how much fighting
he actually saw, but give a general idea of his

movements. He was first stationed near

NOV 1. 1937 =

 
Phillips, William Horace
(3) Sketch

 

Williamsburg, Va. and later moved down to the
very end of the Peninsula. In the spring and
summer of 1862 he participated inthe defense of
Richmond; in 1863 he marched to Gettysburg and
saw action on July 3; in 1864 he was stationed
between Petersburg and Richmond and remained
in that vicinity until the close of the war.

On the whole, Phillips had a better idea of
the trend of events during the war, than did

the average private. He apparently overstayed

NOV 1 1937 &

 
Phillips, William Horace
(4) Sketch

 

his leave at home on one occasion, for hich he
spent tow weeks in the guard house. Henceforth
his family discouraged such procedure.

Phillips' chielf interest in life was food,
so that his Jetters home were more concerned

with what he had to eat and his prospects of

getting more,than with any other subject. The
letters reveal the comparatively large amounts
of food furnished soldiers from their homes, as

well as the equally large provision of clothing

(5) Sketch
from the same source, which was the frequent
concern of many soldiers. The letters also
contain comment on marches, camp life, the gener=
al situation in the Confederacy, the results of
battles, and desertion. On the whole, the

 

collection 1s slightly better than the average
correspondence of confederate soldiers.

In addition to the letters there are thirteen
Pieces containg copies of ballads and original

poems of W. H. Phillips. They chiefly show that

These two albums entitled "Photographs of

Florida, mostly scenes at former Civil War bat-
tlefields. Album I includes Bull Run (Nos. 1l-

West Virginia (25-26), Fredericksburg (27-44),
Guiney's Station (55-56), and Chancellorsville

(36-42). The views may be either of those
places or of locations in their environs.

The albums appear to be a compilation of
photographs taken by different people at differ-

graphs vary. Some pictures in Album II are
labeled in print as the work of the Centennial
Photographic Co. and were copyrighted in 1876.

There are views of at least two monuments erec-—

of the photographs are albumen prints, but there

 

are also a small number of emulsion-paper prints
(Album II, 1-6, for examples). Emulsion-paper
prints were not in common use until about 1888.
The location labels for the photographs were all

1888 at the earliest. These facts indicate that

 

the photographs were labeled after 1888, and the
album may well have been compiled at the same

Philip Syng Physick (1768-1837), sometimes
is called the "Father of American Surgery". His
papers are general in character, with a land
receipt of his father, Edmund Physick and a
few bills. JasXS N. Ellis of Richmond, Va., wrote
to Physick to consult him about a fellow cadet
at West Point, and Physick replies to his query.

Dr. Philip Syng Physick writes to the Hon. Jas-
per Yeates of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, of the
difficulty he had experienced with a young man,
J. Hand, a student who was reading medicine in
Physick's office. For the biography of Yeates,
see the letter of Oct. 31, » from Whitfield

Evidently Jasper Yeates was related to
Catherine (Ewing) Hand, wife of Edward Hand
(1744-1802) physician and patriot of "Rockford",
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Mr. Hand died

suddenly in 1502 in very involved financial
circumstances. Jasper Yeates evidently had
placed J[ohn?] Hand in Physick's office to study
medicine. J. Hand is probably the son of Edward
and Catherine Hand, who married in 1775.

1904. Tunkhannock, Wyoming Co., and Harrisburg
Dauphin Co., Pa.

 

William M. Piatt, to whom the letters in
this collection are addressed, was a lawyer of
Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, and a member of the
Pennsylvania legislature in the 1850's, holding

the office of Speaker of the Senate for a term.
The letters indicate that he was an enthusiastic
member of the Democratic Party and, aside from
sincere personal interest in temperence legis-
lation, appears to be a politician primarily
concerned with the interests of his

 
 

Piatt, William M.
party and his friends.

The collection begins with a letter of
Oct. 13, 1845, referring to the North Branch
Canal. A. Beaumont on Feb. 3, 1850 writes
thanking Piatt for helping stop a rumor about
the Canal started by one of General Cameron's

friends. A letter from William Bridle of Jan.
22, 1853, in which he says that he thinks Maj.
Gen. Robert Patterson will be Secretary of War,
also mentions the Canal and Towanda Bridge.
nodes tercobhsGe& In January and March,
1855 petitions from ‘eo Bridge Company

 
t 3
td the Senate and House of Representatives of
Pennsylvania explain much of the controversy
over the canal and the need for the bridge to
be raised at State expense. In April 1855
@ letter opposes a bill to give Mr. Moffit pos-
session of the North Branch Canal and several

 

letters refer to the price of coal and how it
will be lowered by using canal transportation.
The final mention of the canal is a denounce-
ment of Moffitt's management of the canal
written by Elhanan Smith from Tunkhannock on

February 15, 1856. =

 
Piatt, William M. &
From 1845 to 1847 the letters are personal

or refer to private legal affairs.

Benjamin 8. Dartt of Troy, Pa. January 18,
1852, congratulating Piatt on his appointment
to the State Temperance Convention, says that
three-fourths of his constituents favor a

 

Prohibitory Liquor Law. The liquor-law is
mentioned in a letter from T. M. Atherton of
Hunsville in January 1854, and May 18, 1855
a letter from Nathaniel Borrodail Browne of
Phila. expresses pleasure at passage of the
temperance bill  @ rewrote. In this

 
Piatt, William M. 5

letter he mentions the high position Piatt holé
in the party and his disapproval of holding the
Democratic Convention in October. A letter of

Feb. 6, 1856 from George Atkinson says he heard
the liquor law was repealed by the House and in
the same letter asks how former governor Bigler

 

stands on the Nebraska question. In the same
month Dr. N. Wills of Sterlingville hopes at
least the Sunday prohibition, & porhibition
to minors and habitual drunkards will be kept.
The other side of the question appears in a
letter of March 11, x) from E. N. Baron,

 
Piatt, William M. 6
tavern keeper, objecting to the Liquor License
Bill because it prevents his minor sons from
helping him in his business. In an exchange
of letters this same month with the Rev. John
Chambers of Philadelphia, Piatt urges Chambers
to publish his letters to members of the

 

legislature relative to temperance. A letter
from the Collector's Office, U. S$. Internal
Revenue, Towanda, Pa., March 6, 1863,refers to
liquor licensing and finally the temperance
bill is mentioned in a letter from P. W. Oster-
house, Feb. 14, a io he also discusses

 
Piatt, William M. 7
the Law Association,

Letters of 1852 refer to the meeting time
of courts in Luzerne and Bradford counties, the
State Road Bill, private legal cases, and a
Board of Missions in Philadelphia. In 1853
Charles Rollin Buckalew says he would be grati-

 

fied at Piatt's political success but is not
unfriendly to Mr. Sanderson or Mr. Blanding,
and A. Dietrick mentions that he received
unanimous nomination for Senator.

Jan. 1854 starts with discourses on politics
from A. Hine of —— i and S. S. Win-

 
Piatt, William M. 8
chester of Wilkes-Barre. The roads laws in

Pa., especially as they relate to Wyoming
County, are the subject of a letter from A. C.
Case,and the scarcity of cash and dullness of
business in Tunkhannock is mentioned by George
Tutton. Thomas S. Fernon writes from the Office

 

of the North Penna. R. R. Co. in Philadelphia
asking that the Towanda and Franklin R. R.
Supplement be hurried, and U. Marcus gives the
reasons for the amendment to the Towanda and
Franklin R. R. In Feb. A. Hine praises Thomas
as the best mem to “oe the North Branch

 
Piatt, William M. 9
Canal interests; John Brooke of Falls, Wyoming
County, expresses political concern over the
newspaper to be published called the North
Branch Democrat, and the political efforts of
its backers and their threats to expose the
high cost of canal building; and Charles F.

 

 

Welles of Wyoming gives details of the degrees
of ascent on various sections of the state
road in connection with the Graduation Law.

A chatty personal letter from Elhanon
Smith of March 6, 1855 says that everyone is

talking about the “3 R. R. Little writes

 
Piatt, William M. 10
a few days later relative to the question of

dividing his judicial district. In April
Benjamin Harris Brewster sent a bill for
professional service, and in November William
Bigler wrote regarding his possible election
to the U. S. Senate, hoping his party would

 

support him after his awful defeat the pre-
vious fall at the hands of the Know-Nothings.
In Nov. & Dec. of this year there are several
letters requesting the job as clerk of the

State Senate.

 
Piatt, William M. 11
A letter covering a petition supporting

Bigler for the State Senate appears in Jan.
1856, and a query about Bigler's position on
the 6lavery question arrives from R. R. Little
Several people write congratulating Piatt as
Speaker of the Senate, Railroad business is

 

discussed this same month in letters by Simon
Cameron; William Muhlenberg Hiester, asking
support for the Reading and Lehigh R. R. bill;
and by Michael Meylert of Scranton, relative
to the supplement requested for the Lackawanna
R. R. The need for ~@ bill to borrow money

 
Piatt, William M. 123
to expand the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western
Railroad is fully explained in a printed letter
sent to the members of the Pennsylvania House
of Representatives in February 1856. On Feb.
5, John Nesbitt Conyngham explains the need for
larger appropriation for the Institute for the

 

Deaf and Dumb in Philadelphia. A proposed
bank bill is mentioned Feb. 7 in a letter from
George Sanderson; a few days later William
Brindle denounces this "absurd bill to give
certain Banks power over the public monies";
and on March 13, R. i of Philadelphia

 
Piatt, William M.
wants Jordan's bill killed as its effect will
be to pile up money in the Bank of Penna. to
the exclusion of other banks.

On the 19th of February 1856, F. Smith
wrote opposing a bill to purchase a county farm
and erect a county poor house for Bradford

 

County. It is favored in an April letter of H.
L. Scott. A letter sent from Washington, March
12, by James Hepburn Campbell refers to R. R.
Little and a judgeship. On the same day Har-
vey Sickles mentions revivals in Tunkhannock by
Methodists and a referring part-

 
Piatt, William M. 14

icularly to the "princely preaching of Mr.

Mitchel;"as do several letters during the com-

ing month. On the 13th Chester Thomas in a

letter concerning an election says he prefers

Piatt as he favors the division of Bucks County
R. H. Small announced publication of the

 

Forum by David Paul Brown; and James McClure
wrote his objections to powers assumed by the
Philadelphia City councils to designate school
funds, e. g., reducing teachers! salaries so
that some are due only $250 per annum and that
is in arrears. A “Ss later Piatt wrote to

 
Piatt, William M. 15
J. Campbell favoring avpointment of D. A.
Yarrington to carry mail to San Francisco and
back. Several letters in March from J. Morley
Jr. of Morrisville request passage of his
bill for divorce. An ambiguous letter from
William Brindle March 21, urging young men to

 

break loose from the lead of old and selfish
politicians, refers to Bigler and Buckalew.
Other March correspondence includes a discussia
of the Democratic Party from Piatt, opposition
of Allan M. Kearn to transfering V. E. Piolett'g
case against him to ‘eo of another county,

 
Piatt, William M. _18
and John Jessup's comments on the Montrose and
Hartford Plank Road.

April 9th, Hickling, Swan and Brown of
Boston wrote praising Dr. Worcester's diction-
ary, R. R. Little commented on the coming
election, and William Elnell wrote about an
Insurance Co. Charter. April also brought a
letter from Charles Wesley Carrigan concerning
a bill for the preservation of records of
courts. Simon Cameron wrote on December 8
about his election to the U. 8S. Senate.

On January 9, 1857, John Cresswell revealed
details of the a | choose a Senator, and

 

 
Piatt, William M. 17

on October 2 he admits that he wishes to be
the next Speaker. Political concerns also
dominate the correspondence of 1858 and 1859.
One exception is a letter of May 1859 from
George Sanderson in which he says the stock of
N. Y. and Penna. Coal is worth nothing.

 

National politics made an appearance in
1860 when George J. Bolton, mentioning the
great interest in the Charleston Convention,
presumes that Douglas! friends predominate, and
gives his opinion of Southern Democrats and
their indulgence by Ce On April 29, 1864

 
Piatt, William M. 18

soon after he became Secretary of War under
Lincoln, Simon Cameron wrote concerning
applications for a position under discussion.
August 11, 1862, M. C. Dunnier asked exemption
from the draft as he was an engineer in charge
of lighthouses, and on September 2 of that

 

year W. Patton hopes that an alignment of Demo-
crats and Whigs against Republicans in his
congressional district will defeat Wilmot and
the abolitionists. An interesting note from

J. M. Quiggle of Philadelphia, written Feb.

3, 1883, says it is oo" property as

 
Piatt, William M. 19
people of Phila. and N. Y. believe that within
90 days this government will be ended.

J. W. Wooding of San Francisco, February
20, 1864, recounting his trip through Panama,
described the natives and scenery and goes on
to mention his voyage aboard the steamer

 

Constitution. At the time of writing he was
a teacher in the city college of San Francisco.
In March 1864 Charles John Biddle mentioned
that the time and place of the State Convention
was announced in the newspaper, The Age, and
on July 23 a letter ‘¢ to resumption of the

 
Piatt, William M. 20
draft. Other letters of 1864-65 are primarily

concerned with private legal cases.

The rapid advance of railroads is indicated
in a letter of January 1867 from Sioux City,
Iowa, suggesting that Piatt wait a couple of
years to sell his land in the West as the

 

arrival of railroads will increase its value.
Praise for a college at Georgetown, D. C., is
given in a letter from Samual J. Randall in
April of that year. A legal claim mentioned on
Nov. 25, 1887, concerns a boy who was taken intd
the army on the an Ye pay his mother $300.

 
Piatt, William M. 21
Several letters from Samuel J. Randall in
1868 are concerned with political patronage,
and in May of that year William A. Wallace
mentions the Registry Law.
Political difficulties of the Democratic
Party in Pennsylvania are indicated in a letter

 

of May 30, 1869 from Charles W. Carrigan in
which he discusses how to save the state from
the "Infernal Radicals." In 1870 and 1871
several letters are concerned with attempts to
find a position for Piatt's son, including one
from Francis Jordan, eo” of the Common-

 
Piatt, William M. 22
wealth. The demand for railroad passes appears

in several letters, including one of May 25,
1872 from D. C. Kitchen, calling attention to
an article he wrote and bluntly saying that he
could be of further use to the railroads.

The latter half of 1872 is filled with

 

correspondence about the State Constitutional
Convention and an alliance between Democrats
and Liberal Republicans to beat the Radical
candidates, e. g., a letter from Les Miller,
August 34, and one from S. W. Buck on December
12. Samuel Randall ‘é an interesting letter

 
Piatt, William M. 33
on November 30, bewailing the tragic death of
Horace Greeley. On April 15, 1873, R. A.
Lamberton of Harrisburg wrote about changes in
Harrisburg's wards, and on June 30, S. W. Buck
requested the job as secretary of the State
Committee at the Convention.

 

John B. Linn wrote in 1878 that the com-
missioners of Wyoming County never procured the
standard weights and measures. A letter from
John J. Metzger of December 1881 refers to the
case of the Lycoming Fire Insurance Co.

Undated letters ‘oe collection include

 
Piatt, William M. 34
one from C. B. Chase, inquiring about Wilmot
and Anti-Slavery restrictions, a reference to
a petition for good schools by E. Geiger, and
a request for publication of public acts.

The few bills and receipts are concerned
with legal work. — =

 

Legal papers include two petitions, one
from Bradford County and one from Columbia
County, objecting to taxation and other legal
arrangements for public schools,

19 items added, 2-23-62. The letters are
political in nature, reflecting William M.
Piatt's influence as head of the Democratic
Party in Wyoming County, Pa. On May 10, 1855,
Piatt is congratulated upon becoming Speaker of
the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.

This addition refers to Democratic patronage,

candidates and elections. Judge David Wilmot
figures in letters of April 2, 1852, and March
9, 1861. A brief glimpse is given of Pa.
Democrats during Republican triumphs of the
Civil War and Reconstruction periods. On June

 
Piatt, William M. 26
21, 1867, James Harding writes from California,
giving a description of Democratic politics in
that state and of the race between Henry Hunt-
ley Haight and George C. Gorham for the gover-
norship. Clippings déscribe the North Branch
[Susquehanna River] Canal, April 25, 1855, and
an iron mine development in Granville. Co., N. C,

 

in 1925. Among the prominent political cor-
respondents, 1852-1872, are William Bigler,

Samuel Thomas Pickard (1828-1915) was a
biographer, printer, editor, and author. Al-
though born in Rowley, Massachusetts, he spent
his youth in Auburn, Maine, and attended the
Lewiston Falls Academy. After learning the

printer's trade, he became associated with the
publication of a humorous paper, the Carpet

Bag, in Boston. In 1853 he joined E. P. Weston
n publishing the Eclectic:,. which two years

 
Pickard, Samuel Thomas 2
later merged with the Portland Transcript.
Pickard was one of the editors and part-owner
of this paper for almost forty years. His
wife was Elizabeth Hussey Whittier, a niece of
John Greenleaf Whittier. The two men became
close friends, and when Whittier died, Pickard
became his biographer and literary executor.
As a result, he published Life and Letters of
John Greenleaf Whittier, Whittier as a Politi-
cian, and Whittier-Land, a Handbook of North

Essex. Pickard spent his later years in Boston

 

 

 

 

 
Pickard, Samuel Thomas

 

and Amesbury, Massachusetts, where he died.

The letter, dated December 11, 1905, from
Pickard to Homer[?] Norris, Jr. was laid in a
copy of Whittier-Land. Pickard discussed the
many autograph letters he had from authors and
public men, and offered to send some of them
to Norris on approval.

vicinity of Norristown. )Adam H.Pickel
also had a wife and t#o daughters, Sallie
and Mary.

The bulk of the correspondence in the
set was written by Adam,Sarah and Adam H.
Pickel. Sarah Pickel's correspomdence

 

may be dismised as a constant evangelical
exhortation directed at her son,Adam H.,
whom she feared would be contaminated by
army life.

Adam H. Pickel wrote of his travels

 
 

 

PICKEL, Adam H, ee

and campaigns from Fort Lyon(apparently
in what later became W.Va.)to the battles
in and around Fredericksburg,Va. He was

a close ebserver,and many of his letters

are important for comments on the refresh-
ment saloons,condition 6f the barracks,

type of food and the lack of veracity in
news paper reports of federal engagements.
In a letter dated Sept,7,1862,he refers to
the fact that federal soldiers sometimes
died from eating poisoned pies sold on the

 
PICKEL, Adam H. Sketch(5)

streets of Baltimore. He was encamped near
Arlington and aater at Falmouth,Va.from
which place he marched to take part in
the battle of Fredericksburg.

For the reflection of conditions in
eastern Pennsylvania during the war, the

 

letters of Adam Pickel are especially
Valuable. Adam was a democrat who mistrusted
the zealous methods of the abolitionists
and felt that Abraham Lincoln was a

tricky politicion. He wrote his son to

 
PICKEL, Adam H, Sketch. (6)
know whether there was a "secret society" in the
army, and later, Feb.8, 1863, he described a Cop
perhead meeting at West Chester, Pa. His sympa-
thy for Clement L.Vallandigham was marked, and
he gave a detailed account of Vallandigham's
trial and various sentences. He refers to the
foolish program of spending the nation's resour-

 

ces for the "Sweet Cented Negro." In line with
Adam Pickel's view of the Negro question, it is
interesting to note his wife's account of the
Irish laborers of Norristown and Reading.
Although these letters contain certain Consis-
tent grammatical a oe are, strangely

enough,written with he resources of an

ample vocabulary.

Andrew Pickens (1779-1838), South Carolina
politician and planter, served as governor of
the state during 1816-1818. He was the son of
the Revolutionary War hero Andrew Pickens

(1739-1817) and the second cousin of John C.
Calhoun and the first cousin of Mrs. Calhoun.
In 1819 he moved to Alabama where he had a
plantation on the Alabama River in Dallas County.

A letter written from Charleston, S. C., on
May 9, 1801, by George Bowie to Andrew Pickens,
who was in Providence, R. I., tells of his trip
to Charleston and plan to go on to St. Johns
and St. Thomas islands before returning home.
He says there is no news from Pendleton or
Abbeville worth reporting. He does mention the
recent marriage of a Mrs. Maxwell to a Mr.
Caruth of Greenville. He includes greetings
from John Ewing Colhoun and his wife, says Mr.
Colhoun wishes to hear from him and that he

 
Pickens, Andrew (1779-1838) a
has been appointed to the United States Senate.
Colhoun was Pickens' uncle. (According to Apple
ton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography, John
Ewing Colhoun served in the Senate from Dec. LL,
1801, until his death on Nov. 26, 1802.)

A memorandum of agreement of Oct. 31, 1806,

 

 

 

between Andrew Pickens and David Files covers
Pickens' loan of $4000 to Files to be used for
five years in establishing and operating a
store in Jackson County, Georgia, the interest
Pickens would have in any profits from the

 
Pickens, Andrew (1779-1838) 4°

 

business, and the nature of the settlement they
were to make in 1811. There are a few financial
papers relative to the operation of Pickens'
plantation in Alabama after he moved there.

A mortgage bond issued in Edgefield District,

S. C., is for money owed by Daniel Bird to Dr.

William Brazier.

The volume is an eighty-one-page Agricultural
Memorandum Book Pickens kept from Jan. 22, 1822,
to May 29, 1826. It begins by describing his
clearing land for cotton. By March 20 more than

 
Pickens, Andrew (1779-1838) 5

 

100 acres had been cleared for planting. Land
was then cleared for planting corn, which was
planted in "river lands" on March 28. He plant
ed Red River and Mexican cotton seeds as an ex-
periment to see which variety would be better.
The continuing development and operation of the

plantation in Dallas County on the Alabama
River is described. He planted a great variety
of crops and vegetables, and established an

setting out. He records the vicissitudes his
plantings suffer from too much rain or drought
and flooding of his crops.

At the end of the Memorandum Book there are
several pages of accounts. On Feb. 23, 1823,
he recorded the weight each of ten bales of

cotton that he was sending by boat to Mobile.
He mentions spinning and weaving for clothing
for his slaves, and the number of hogs killed
in December, 1822, and January, 1823. On Sept.
23, 1823, he recorded having "Clive cut 7 pairs

 
Pickens, Andrew (1779-1838) 7
negro shoes" for the seven slaves he names.
Hannibal, whom he hired to one Huddleston for
$10.00 per month between June 15 and Oct. 28,
1824, is not named as one of the seven slaves.
Pickens' plantation was close enough to
Cahaba that he could work in the fields and then

 

go there on the same day "in a plank canoe."
Cahaba was the first capital of the state of
Alabama, 1818-1825. Pickens' comments on his
visit to Cahaba during April 24-25, 1822 (pp.
7-9) contain the only known reference to the

government was located there,

Europe, the Holy Land, and northern Africa in
the summer of 1921. Dr. Gilbert T. Rowe, later

Pickens, Francis Wilkinson. Papers.
Edgefield, Edgefield Co., South Carolina

 

Francis Wilkinson Pickens (1805-1869),
a South Carolina politician, had a long and
distinguished career in state and national
politics. He served in the legislature, was a

member of the U. S. House of Representatives,
1834-1844, and was governor of South Carolina,
1860-1862.

The collection consists of Letters, 1833-
1868 & undated, Miscellany, 1806-1867, and an

 
Pickens, Francis Wilkinson 2
Oversize Folder containing legal papers, 1772-
1861, and a broadside of 1840.

The first three letters, dated in 1833, con-
cern preparations in South Carolina to defend
the state against federal troops should Presi-
dent Jackson send them to enforce the tariff

 

acts of 1828 and 1832. Three letters written
to Frances W. Pickens by James Henry Hammond in
1839 and 1840 strongly present his views of
several of their mutual political opponents.
They include Robert Barnwell Rhett and John

 
Pickens, Francis Wilkinson 3
Peter Richardson. Like Pickens, he supported
John C. Calhoun and the State Rights Party.
The letters of 1840 concern his race for the
governorship against Richardson, who defeated
him.

On June 6, 1846, Representative Armistead

 

Burt of Abbeville, S. C., informed Pickens as
to how the Oregon boundary dispute might be
settled, gave his views on the Mexican War, the
tariff, and John C. Calhoun. A letter of

April 26, 1848, is an inquiry about the

 
Pickens, Francis Wilkinson
influence of General Andrew Pickens at the
Battle of Cowpens.

According to a note by Pickens he became
engaged to his third wife, Lucy Petway Holcombs
in August 1857, at Sweet Springs, Virginia. Her
parents moved to Texas from Virginia, anda

 

long letter of Nov. 2-3, 1857, from Pickens to
Lucy is largely an expression of his affection
for her and his fear that she may break their
engagement. Near the end of the letter he

writes about his political career, his slaves,

 
Pickens, Francis Wilkinson 5

 

and the relationship between them and himself.
Lewis Cass, Secretary of State, wrote to
Pickens on Mar. 7, 1860, that the troubles that
afflicted Europe did not affect the United
States, that he had become more hopeful about
North-South relations, and why he felt that way.

In a letter of April 20, 1861, Judge Andrew G.
Magrath, wrote from Montgomery, describing the
excitement about secession in the areas in
which he had traveled from South Carolina to
the first Confederate capital. He also

 
Pickens, Francis Wilkinson 6
described some of the problems in getting the
Confederate government organized. The organi-
zation of the courts was what had taken him to
Montgomery. No more letters appear in the
collection until Aug. 4, 1865. Mrs. Pickens
was then visiting her mother, and Pickens wrote

 

to her, revealing some of the problems he was
having with his former slaves and other aspects
of Reconstruction in South Carolina. In 1868,
William H. Yeldell, Corresponding Secretary

of the Democratic Club of Liberty Hill, asked

 
Pickens, Francis Wilkinson 7
Pickens, Chairman of the Executive Committee of
Edgefield District, for his view of a suggestion
he made of how to control Negro suffrage and
defeat the Radical Party.

Several of the legal papers (Oversize Folder)
reflect the close ties of Francis W. Pickens

 

to the Simkins family. He studied law under
Eldred Simkins in Edgefield, became his partner,
and married his daughter Margaret Eliza. The
papers include a fragment of a land grant and
land deeds of Arthur Simkins (1750-1826),

 
Pickens, Francis Wilkinson 8

 

document showing the distribution of real estate
made by the commissioners appointed under the
will of Eldred Simkins in 1832, document appoint
ing Pickens guardian of minor Emma F. Simkins,
several land deeds of Pickens, two surveyor's
plats of land he owned, and a naturalization

paper for a French subject, Joseph M. S. Kerb-
lay, dated Oct. 30, 1807.

The broadside of 1840 (Oversize Folder) con-
tains an exchange of letters between Pickens
and Waddy Thompson about a dispute between them.

 
Pickens, Francis Wilkinson 9

 

The Miscellany includes: An 1806 extract
about the Pickens family of Edgefield District
from the Edward Hooker Diary, 1805-1808, that
is published in Vol. 1 of the Annual Report of
the American Historical Association for 1896;
account of the sales of the estate of Eliza H.

 

 

Simkins, Oct. 1, 1838; abstract of appropria-
tions by Congress in 1843; resolutions that
Francis W. Pickens proposed at the Nashville
Convention of 1850; account of payment Pickens
made in 1860 as U. S. Minister to Russia to

 
Pickens, Francis Wilkinson ig

 

Russian authorities for supplies and support
given the U. S. captain and seamen of the ship
Phoenix from New York; account dated Nov. 30,
1867, of purchases by Pickens in 1859-1861;
address, possibly by Pickens, relative to Re-
construction; and a draft of a resolution stat-
ing the right of a state to secede from the
Union.

Timothy Pickering (1745-1829) served as
Quartermaster General of the Continental Army
from 1780 to1783. In a letter dated Jan. 20,
1781, he wrote to convey Washington's command
concerning the transportation of supplies by

ox teams to be directed by Thomas Cogswell,
waggon master.

Pickering served a short term as Secretary
of War in 1795. On Sept. 18, 1795, he signed

an order to Nehemiah Freeman to return money

of the United States.

1 item added, 4-14-70: A copy of a letter
to Pickering from Samuel Cooper, a clergyman
in Boston (February 2, 1775). Cooper ex-
pressed his regrets at not being able to
attend an ecclesiastical council to which he
had been invited by Pickering and a number of
others in Salem, Mass.

Albert James Pickett (1810-1858) was born in

North Carolina, but his family moved to Autauga
Co,, Ala. in 1818, where his father owned a
store that was used extensively by Indians and
traders, He had little formal education, and
though he studied Law, he never entered the pro-
fession, living the life of a gentleman planter
during his summers at his Autauga Co. plantatio
and his winters in Montgomery. He became in-
terested in historical writing, and wrote the

a still important work, He spent thousands of
dollars compiling a collection of books and

manuscripts for his research, and his papers
comprise one of the most valuable collections
in the Alabama Dept. of Archives and History.

 

In his + page letter of July 5, 1847 (Mont-

went to Natchez as well, but was unable to meet
with Dr. Monette, a historian of the Mississippi
Valley, who was away at the time, He discusses
his plans to write a history of Alabama, but
feels that there is so little material that it

This is largely the correspondence of Jas. W.
Pierce, but there are letters to Tilman and John
H. Pierce from Wm. B. Pierce. Jas. W. Pierce
went to Kansas sometime before Mar., 1860, proba
bly from N. C. He and his wife, Eliza Jane,

wrote to their relatives,A. G. and Cynthia
Pickett, in glowing terms about Kansas, mention-
ing relatives, opportunities for farmers, and

the strong antislavery sentiment» @nd repeat-
ing stories that were

 
Pierce, James W. (2)

circulating about John Brown.

By Sept., 1860, Jas. W. Pierce had moved to
Hamilton co., Ind. Fyom there he wrote about
the strong antislavery feeling and the popul-
arity of Lincoln and the Republican Party in

 

that area, and repeated rumors he had heard of
slave insurrections in Texas and Ky.

A letter from Doreas E. Cross of St. Louis
co., Mo. speaks of the different religious
sects and the large number of foreigkners in
that county. Commodity prices are quoted

 
Pierce, James Ww. ee (3)
rather often in the correspondence. Ina
letter of July, 1868, Jas. W. Pierce referred
to the presidential candidates and gave his
opinion as to the fate of the country if the:
Democrats won, how Grant comparéd with Lincoln,
the Freemasons, who, according to him, were
responsible for Jefferson Davis not being

 

condened to death, and the attempt to oust
Pres, Johnson from office. A letter of W.R,
Coggin of Warren co., Tenn, tells of a yellow
fever epidemic in Memphis, Chattanooga, and New
Orleans, There is also a satirical poem on

Jonn H, Pierce spent most of the Civil War
period in Illinois, Tennessee, and Mississippi.
Sometime in 1861 he enlisted in Co. D of the
lith Ill. Vol. Cavalry, and when his term ended
he re-enlisted for three years. The correspon-

dence begins when he is at a Camp Logan, then
he moves to Jackson, Tenn., next he writes from
Chillicothe, Ill., and then he goes to a camp

near Clear Creek, Miss., a short distance from
Vicksburg. His last letter, dated Nov. 17,1864

 
Pierce, John dassett. Sketch,

was written from the camp near Vicksburg and on
stationery which lists the battles in which that
regt. had engaged. They include Shiloh, Corint
Granada, engagements near Jackson, and Sherman's
raid through Miss,

The letters in this collection were written

by Pierce to his brother and sister Helen. The

 

principal matters, other than family affairs,
with which they deal are: Ample food in his
regt. at Camp Logan; General Grant—referred to
as "Whiskey Grant" in one letter; Gen. Sherman's
army; the approaching battle of Vicksburg; the

Historical Sketch
Pierpont, governor of the "restored" state
of Virginia 1861-68, was born near Morgantown
on Yan. 25, 1814 and died at Pittsbugh, Penna.

on March 24, 1899. He was educated at Alleghany
College, and after teaching school for two years
was admitted to the bar.

: From 1844 to 1860, Pierpont was an active

Whig, and in 1860 he vigorously supportedlin-
coln. At a convention held at Wheeling in 186}

 
____Pierpont, F. H. 2
Pierpont was elected provisional governor, as
the secessionist officials were said to have
vacated their offices. In 1863,Wwas admitted as
a state, and with the election of a new governor
Pierpont moved his capital to Alexandria, Va.
From 1865-68he conducted Virginian affairs from

 

Richmond. After he was replaced by the military
governor, he returned to W. Virginia and re-
sumed the practice of law.

The letters cover the period 1861-1863.

The letter heads are exceptionally interesting.

Prisoners profess their loyalty to the Union
cause and petition Pierpont for pardons; in-

Pietzcker, George S. Papers. St. Louis,
St. Louis Co., Missouri

 

This album of 25 photographs is identi-
fied by the information stamped on its front
cover: "Aero Meet, Lambert Field, St. Louis,
Mo., Oct., 1910" and "Geo. S. Pietzcker,

Photographer." Pietzcker's name and St.
Louis address are stamped on the last sheet
of the album.

Pietzcker's work as represented in this
album is a remarkable set of photographs

 
Pietzcker, George S.

of early airplanes and aviators. The 25
photographs, 4 1/2 by 6 1/2 in. each, were

all taken during the St. Louis Aero Club's
meet that was held during Oct. 8-16, 1910.
This meet was opened by the arrival of aviator
Arthur Hoxsey whose flight of 104 miles from

 

Springfield, Ill. in a Wright biplane had set
a new American record for longest continuous
flight. There were five Wright biplanes at
this meet. Their pilots included Hoxsey,

 
Pietzcker, George S. 3
Walter Brookins, Al Welsh, and Ralph Johnstone
who were members of the exhibition team for
Wilbur and Orville Wright. Other aviators

at the meet were Roy Knabenshue, J. Clifford
Turpin, Phil O. Parmelee, Englishman Alec
Ogilvie, and Frenchman Alfred LeBlanc. Turpin
and Parmalee also flew Wright biplanes.

 

LeBlanc flew a Blériot monoplane in which he
set a new American Speed record. This appear-
ance of the French Blériot was its first

 
Pietzcker, George S. 4
American flight. This meet was also the
scene of former President Theodore Roosevelt's
first airplane ride. He was the first U.S.
president to fly. Both Hoxsey and Johnstone
died in plane accidents later in 1910.

Fifteen photographs include views of one
of more Wright biplanes or parts of them.
There are three views of the Blériot mono-
plane, Three photos include Theodore Roose-
velt, one in a biplane and two with other
men. A complete list of these photographs

 

 
Pietzcker, George Ss J
is in. the Inventory File. The only identified
aviator is Hoxsey, who is known because he is
seated with Roosevelt. Other aviators are
undoubtedly in these pictures also.

In 1910 the Wright Company produced the
Model B biplane. Some of the planes in this
album come close to it in appearance, but none
is identical with it. The evolution of the
Model B from the 1907-type machines is de-
scribed in The Papers of Wilbur and Orville

 

 

 
Pietzcker, George S. 6
Wright, Vol. 2, p. 1197, and in accompanying
drawings and photographs: "The evolution of
the Model B from the 1907-type machines used
in 1909 was gradual. Orville Wright experi-
mented with the placement of the horizontal
control surfaces in Berlin in 1909, and Wilbur
made similar experiments at College Park, Md.
In 1910 the Wrights applied a fixed horizontal
stabilizer to the tail of their 1909 machine
(continued on next card)

 

 
Pietzcker, George S. vi)
(Plate 208). It was then made movable, work-
ing in conjunction with the horizontal front
rudder. The horizontal front rudder was next
removed altogether and wheels were attached
to the skids, thus dispensing with the need
for the catapult launching device which had

 

been employed continuously since September
1904. Eventually the front ends of the skids
were flattened and shortened, and triangular
blinkers replaced the semicircular blinkers,
in use since 1905. These intermediate types,

 
Pietzcker, George S.
hind the blinkers than did the Model B of
the drawing and a 1911 photograph. These

struts are the same as in the 1907-1909
models.

Pietzcker, George S. 8

 

as well as the 1907-type machine used in 1908
and 1909 and the Signal Corps machine of 1909,
are sometimes referred to as the Wright Model
A, although the Wrights never designated them
as such,"

All of the Wright biplanes that are clear-
ly discernible in this album appear to be the
"Model A" or what is referred to in The Pa-
pers of Wilbur and Orville Wright as transi-
tional models between the 1907-type and the
Model B of 1910. All biplanes in this album

 

 
Pietzcker, George S.

have rear rudders and wheels. Two photos
include biplanes that also have front rud-
ders. Most planes have semicircular front
blinkers, but the one in photo no. 24 has
triangular blinkers. So, there are at least
three different transitional models pictured

 

in this album. None of them exactly matches
the drawing of Model B printed in The Papers
of Wilbur and Orville Wright, Vol. 2, p. 1196.
All planes in this album have more struts be-

Pilot Mills Company originated as the Pilot
Cotton Mills Co. established in 1892 by the
partnership of Williamson & Foster, the partners
being James Nathaniel Williamson (b. 1842) and

his son William Holt Williamson and the former's
son-in-law Omega H. Foster, proprietor of the
Cotton Compress in Raleigh. The prime movers in
this enterprise were the Williamsons, owners and
operators of several earlier cotton mills in

 
Pilot Mills Company

Alamance County. James N. Williamson married
Mary E. Holt, daughter of Edwin M. Holt, a
textile manufacturer of Alamance County with
whom he was engaged in business. In 1894 the
partnership of Williamson & Foster was dissolved,
the new governing firm being called Jas. N. &

 

W. H. Williamson. William Holt Williamson
continued as chief executive of Pilot Cotton
Mills until 1920 or 1921 when the mill became
part of the Consolidated Textile Corporation of
New York City. Consolidated operated mills in

 
Pilot Mills Company

 

several states, among them the Williamsons'
former enterprises, Pilot Mills, Ossipee Cotton
Mills at Elon College, and Hopedale Mills at
Burlington. The mill continued as part of
Consolidated until 1931 when it was incorporated
as Pilot Mills Co. In 1973 or 1974 ownership

changed, and the mill became Crompton-Pilot Mill
Co. The listing in Davison's Textile Blue Book
for 1982 is Crompton Company, Inc., Pilot Plant.
Biographical information about James N. William-
son and his sons William H. and James N., JUr.,

 

 
Pilot Mills Company 4
all of whom were associated with Pilot Mills, is
in Samuel A. Ashe's Biographical History of

North Carolina, Vol. VII, pp. 485-498. The mills
are listed in Davison's Textile Blue Book, and
Consolidated also appears in Moody's Manual of
Investments. The information folder in this

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection contains copies of pages from all
these sources.

The collection consists of correspondence,
1892-1918, legal papers, 1892-1922, financial
papers, 1890-1971, oversize folders of plans and

 
Pilot Mills Company 5

 

blueprints (1890-1971) and legal and financial
papers (1894-1918), printed material, 1906,
miscellany, 1890's, and volumes, 1907-1971. The
correspondence, legal papers, financial papers,
and plans and blueprints are the principal part
of the collection.

This collection is a remnant of what must
have been a very large company archive. This
remnant is significant, however, because much of
it documents the construction and equipping of
Pilot Cotton Mills in the 1890's, its ownership,

 
Pilot Mills Company 6
and financial operations during its first decade.
Construction includes mill houses and a combi-
nation office and residence. The considerable
technological aspect of this collection includes
both construction and equipment of various kinds
as represented by letters, contracts, blueprints
and plans, etc. While the papers are more

 

concentrated during the first decade of the
company, there is material scattered through
subsequent years, especially among the blue-

prints and plans.

1893); a fire sprinkling system (Aug. 3, 1892);

arrangements with Joshua C. Baily & Co. of

Charleston and Belmont §. ¢C. Historical Sketec

Eliza (Lucas) Pinckney (ca. 1722-1793) was o
one of the most outstanding women of the colon-
ial period, and is best known for her activity
in advancing indigo culture in 8. C. She was
born in Antigua, educated in England, and came

to South Carolina with her family in 1738. When
her father, George Lucas, returned to Antigua,
Eliza was left in charge of three plantations.
On May 27, 1744, she married Charles Pinckney

and lived at Belmont plantation near Charleston.

 
Pinckney, Elizabeth (Lucas) (2)

Here their two sons, Charles Cotesworth and
Thomas, and daughter Harriot, were born. In
1753 the family went to London, Charles Pinckney
having been appointed colonial agent for §S, C.
In 1758 they returned to Carolina where Charles
Pinckney soon died of malaria (July 12, 1758).
Eliza Pinckney again took up plantation manage-
ment. The sons did not return to Carolina until
1769 and 1774 respectively. The daughter mar-
ried Daniel Horry, and with her Eliza Pinckney
lived during the years following the Revolution
She had a wide circle of friends both in Eng.

 

 

 
Pinckney, Elizabeth (Lucas) (3)
and this country among the most prominent people

Her two sons achieved great prominence as of-
ficers in the Revolution and as diplomats in fal
lowing years. Eliza Pinckney was a woman of
great energy and ambition, as well as being pos-
sessed of much social charm and conversational
powers. Her efforts with indiga were ultimately
successful,* while she also experimented with
flax, hemp, and silk.

These letters, a portion of a carefully kept
letterbook, display her education, ability, and

personal characteristics in considerable varie-
ty, although the letters are, for the most part,
very formal and those to her parents filled wit
evidences of the most profound respect, while

Pinckney (1750-1828) was born in Charleston,
educated in England, studied law, participated
in the Revolution, was minister to Eng., negoti-
ated the 1793 treaty with Spain, and served his
country and state in many other capacities.
These letters deal with London gossip, construc®
ion of the Santee Canal, and troops for the Ind-
ian troubles of 1813 in Ga.

General James Grant (1720-1806) concerning Mrs.
Turnbull's petition to the Lord Commissioners
of the Treasury when Thomas Pinckney was U. S.
Minister to Great Britain, 1792-1794. Grant

had served in the Carolinas and was governor of
East Florida in 1768 during the beginning of
a colonization plan. Mrs. Maria Gracia (Dura
Bin) Turnbull was the Greek wife of a Scottish

physician, Andrew Turnbull, who tried unsuccess-
fully to colonize 15,000 Greeks, Moravians, etc,

 
Pinckney, Thomas 4
at New Smyrna, East Florida, in 1766-1782,
Turnbull forfeited his grants because he adhered
to the colonial cause during the Revolutionary
War. He settled in Charleston, S. C., in 1782.
This petition mentioned in General Grant's
letter probably referred to £ 15,000 in claims

 

arising from Turnbull's losses in East Florida.

Pinkney Family. Papers, 1804-1906. Annapolis,
Anne Arundel Co., and Baltimore, Baltimore Co.,
Maryland

 

The Pinkney family papers are chiefly those
of William (1764-1822) and his brother Ninian
Pinkney (1776-1825), with a few manuscripts
belonging to Bishop William Pinkney (1810-

1883), the son of Ninian Pinkney.
The manuscripts begin in 1804 with an
* invitation to the Senate of Maryland to attend
a dinner in honor of William Pinkney on his

 
Pinkney. Family

 

return from England where he served as a
commissioner to negotiate American claims
under the Jay Treaty.

Ninian Pinkney, the brother of William,
served as clerk of the Executive Council of
Maryland for thirty years. U. S. Senator
Robert Henry Goldsborough wrote to him in 1813
on the subject of Federal aid to Maryland's
militia and for a statement of the expenses
incurred by the state. Evidently Governor
Levin Winder had written to President Madison

 
Pinkney Family 3

 

for aid for militia expenditures. A few legal
directives issued by the Council were signed
by Ninian Pinkney.

William Howard, a Baltimorean in the U. S.
Corps of Engineers, wrote to Ninian Pinkney
on May 28, 1823, to learn who had been appointed
to the commission to investigate the project
of a Potomac Canal. This project had been
heatedly discussed in Maryland and Virginia.
A joint commission was appointed which finally
proposed a Potomac Canal Company. Evidently

 
Pinkney Family 4

 

the commission membership was undergoing some
changes in 1823. This was preliminary to the
building of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.
Howard wrote again to Pinkney on Jan. 29, 1824,
Signing himself as a commissioner and treasurer
of the Potomac and Baltimore Canal survey.

He sent in expense accounts (not with his

letter) and mentions the publication of the
Survey report. Baltimore bitterly opposed the
canal which would not connect to that city.
Howard and the commission reported it was not

 
Pinkney Family 5

 

practical to extend the canal to Baltimore.
Howard's survey was evidently a preliminary
to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal which was
started in 1826.

Ninian Pinkney's son, William (1810-1823),
became Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal
Diocese of Maryland. He received a number of

letters from 1844 till 1879 from a friend,
Orlando Hutton, who was also an Episcopal
rector. They comment on the events of
Pinkney's life. On May 22, 1861, the

 
Pinkney Family 6
uncertainty caused by the strife of civil war
is reflected as Hutton urges Pinkney to accept
the election as Bishop of Alabama.

These letters were written for the most part

In 1862 Lieut. William T. Pippey was stationed

he was transferred to Ky. to serve with Burnside

on supplies for the soldiers. Lieut. Pippey's
opinions of Negroes and Abolitionists underwent
considerable change and his wiews are fully ex-
pressed in these letters. Most of these letters
were written to Lieut. Pippey's brother, who was
evidently associated with him in business. Ed-
ward Pippey was, in contrast to William, very
poorly educated and his few letters reveal very
little.

Miscellaneous letters and notes written by
William Pitt (1759-1806), statesman and prime
minister. Most of the correspondence is address
ed to Sir James Bland Burges, under-secretary
of state in the foreign department (1789-95),
and consists of brief instructions and covering
letters sent with official papers. Two letters
‘deal with arrangements for cabinet meetings -
one in 1790 refers to negotiations with Lisbon,
and one in 1790 refers to a dispatch to Berlin.
Mentioned in the letters are Lord Auckland,

 
 

Pitt. ~1806) e
Cord eieth Lo renville, and John Scott. The

most informative letters are the earliest to
the Earl of Westmorland and are concerned with
Pitt's proposed candidacy for Cambridge Univer-
sity and his negative attitude toward party
affiliation, and a 1792 summary of a private

conversation with Hugues Maret, a representa-
tive of the French government sent by Pierre
Lebrun to pave the way for peaceful relations
between France and England, during which Pitt
warned that Britain would stand by her ally,
Holland. A medical prescription wrttten for

6 items added, 8-1-62,. These manuscripts

 

are a valuable addition to the papers of the
Pitt family that are either published or avail-
able to the public in depositories. Included
here are: five letters of William Pitt, First
Earl of Chattem (1762-177); thirty-nine let-

 
Pitt, William Ot? -1806) 4
ters o lliam Fitt, his son (1773-1798 an

n. d.); thirteen from John Pitt, Second Earl

of Chatham (1769-1796); and one letter and a
poem by James Charles Pitt, brother of John and
the younger William Pitt. Most of these let-
ters are addressed to the Reverend Edward

Wilson; family friend and tutor of the Pitt
children. One letter and a memorandum on the
abolition of tithes are by Wilson. Eleven
letters are addressed to James Grenville or to

 
Pitt, William (1759-1806) 5

 

his son, James, First Baron Glastonbury, who
are relatives. These letters span both the
childhood and the active political careers of
the younger William Pitt and John, his brother,
and they are valuable for information about

the family. The manuscripts, however, are

scattered chronOlogically through three decades
Several letters from Arthur Philip Stanhope,
Sixth Barl Stanhope, concern the location of
manuscripts of the Pitt family. In 1881 he
acknowledges the receipt of letters of Lady
Chatham, wife of the } Berl of Chatham,

 
 

Pitt, William (1759-1806) 6
rom “enry Alex Brown (May 5, 13, 16, 1881).

Stanhope mentions the existence at his family
home of a correspondence between Lady Chatham
and Lady Stanhope. He also returns to Brown
a book that has copies of the letters that
were sent to him. In this letter the name

of the Reverend Edward Wilson is noted, but
whether or not this remark relates to the
letters from the Pitts to Wilson is unclear
(this correspondence is described below).

In 188 Stanhope accepts a picture of Pitt, a

 
 

Pitt, William (1759-1806) 7
equest from Henry Brown (letters of April li,
13, 1884, to Arthur Clarke Brown), and the
Earl mentions his collection of Pitt manu-
scripts. Charles, Third Barl Stanhope, mar-

ried the sister of the younger William Pitt,
and Philip Henry, Fifth Earl Stanhope, wrote

a biography of him.

attributed to JéBH Charles; and a memorandum
on tithes by Wilson. A former owner of these

manuscripts grouped them into sections and
supplied a few notes about them. The hand-
writing on these notes does not appear to be
that either the Fifth Earl Stanhope or the
Sixth Earl. The letters date from 1762 to

1798.

Some of the manuscripts lack dates for the
year in which they were written, and the au-
thor of the notes has apparently attempted to
correct this deficiency. Anyone who uses

these manuscripts must exercise caution con=
cerning these added dates; becausdat least

two have been found incorrect. One letter from
the younger Pitt to Wilson is dated Saturday,
October 11, and the date of 1775 has been
added. In 17735 however, October 11 came on

a Wednesday. “his letter remains undated,

Another manuscript of Saturday, Feb. 3, 18
identified as being from 1783. In 1781, how-
ever, February 3 came on a Saturday (not in
1783), and the content also does not agree
with the later date.

The five letters of William Pitt, First

Earl of Chatham, are addressed to Jouvencel,
perhaps C. Jouvencel, a clerk in the Privy
Council Office and apparently a free tenant
on the estate at Hayes (see Brian Tunstall,

Pp. 430. They concern personal and financial
matters, and two of them also relate to the
younger Pitt's life at Cambridge (Oct. 27,
1773, and Sept. 9, 1774). The other letters
date from Nov. 19, 1762, Jan. 3, and Feb. l,
1773.

Fifteen letters of 1769-1796 are addressed
to the Reverend Edward Wilson from John Pitt,
Second Karl of Chatham. Wilson was the tutor
of the five Pitt children and was later a canon
at Windsor. His residence appears on a nume

ber of letters. In the early letters John

Pitt often comments upon the studies of him-
self and his two brothers. Frequently he notes
the health of Lord Chatham, his father. On
February 3, 1772, Pitt remarks that they have
read part of "The Fashionable Lover," a new

play by Richard Cumberland, dramatist, and that
they would like to see it performed. Lord
Chatham is pleased with Lord Granby's request
for a copy of his picture, and Brampton is free
to comply with his wishes (Nov..2), 1773).

On November 21, 1777, Pitt discusses Chatham's
motion in the House of Lords for peace with
the colonies. Lord Granby offers the same a-

mendment in the House of Commons. Pitt also
expresses concern about the absence of news

 

from General a oy and his army in America.

On December 17, 1782, he writes about his
military appointment, the illness of William,
and the likelihood that Charles James Fox
means to make a motion for bringingthe treaty

few months later John expresses his feelings
about Mary Elizabeth Townshend whom he marries
in July (June 11, 1783). On August 27, 1783,
he discusses festivities at Burton Pynsent,
William Pitt's sittings for a picture by

George Romney, the cabinet and the treaty with
America, and an astronomical phenomenon on
August 25 (possibly a large meteor). On July
13, 1785, Pitt mentions his and William's sit-
tings for Romney and also family matters. On

only letter by him in this collection. On

July 10, 1788, John announces his appointment
as first lord of the admiralty. On Sept. 26,
1796, he notes his cabinet appointment as pres=
ident of the council, and he expresses satis-

faction with the recent military success of
the Austrians against the French.

There are twenty-eight letters from the
younger William Pitt to Edward Wilson from
1773 to 1798. On December 27, 177), Pitt re-

 
 

 

Pitt, William (1729-1806) 16
ports news from etyman, his tutor, at Cam-=
bridge (Sir George Pretyman Tomline). He
gives some details of why James Lambert, a

professor of Greek, wants to leave the Uni-

versity. On February 1}, 1775, Pitt reports
his father's motion in the House of Lords for

the withdrawal of troops from Boston. He al-
so notes the publication of a speech on this
occasion by Chatham that is entirely spurious.
Other letters from 1775 and also from 1776
concern Pitt's life at Pembroke College, Cam-

 
 

Pitt, William (1759-1806) 17
ridge, his father's health, and other persone
matters. On June 3, 1777, he writes abat his
father's health and recent speeches in the
House of Lords. He also remarks upon a speech
there by William Markham, Archbishop of York,
whose pronouncements have been criticized by

Chatham and others. On May 11, 1778, Pitt
announces the death of his father that morn-
ing. Later in the same year he criticizes
the government's naval preparedness and also
mentions his defence of Lord M. (Nov. 8).

 
Pitt, William (1759-1806) 18
Pitt's parliamentary career begins with his
election from Appleby in 1780, and his let-
ters after this date concern some aspects of
his political career. In July, 1780, he is
visiting Pembroke Hall at Cambridge, studying
law, and anticipating the opportunities for

 

practicing law in western England (July 11).
He is called to the bar in June and goes on
the western circuit in August. Later in

1780 Pitt discusses his election from Appleby
for which Lord Lowther is responsible ( ‘

says (writings or speeches in the House of
Commons ?). In the letter of February 3, 1781,
Pitt may be referring to his first speech in

 

Parliament. On September 11, 1783, Pitt
writes from Dover about plans for his trip
in France and about his intention to complete
the promised sittings for a portrait by Rom-
ney. In 178 Pitt refuses some favor for

 
Pitt, William (1 -1806 20
George Pre tyman REC his former tutor, but
hopes to assist him later (February 6). On
February 16, 178), Pitt asks Wilson's pre-
ference for a clerical post at Windsor or
Westminster. On August 9, 1792, he reports
the King's promise to him (Pitt) of the ward-

enship of the Cinque Ports when it becomes va-
cant. On September 28, 1798, Pitt thanks Wil-
son fora letter and other papers on the sub-
ject of tithes, and he comments upon Wilson's
proposals. An unsigned document of 8% pages

 
Pitt, William (1759-1806) 21
entitied, "Observations on Tithes for the
Purpose of Abolition," is apparently the ma-
terial to which Pitt refers. It is in Wil-
son's handwriting.

There is a personal letter from James
Charles Pitt, brother of t he younger William

 

Pitt, Bo Wilson in which their father's
health is noted (January 17, 1776). An un-
titled poem (12 lines) is attributed to James
Pitt by the person who compiled this folder.
The poem is dated, June 9, 1771.

here are eleven other letters of William

Pitt that are not filed within the folder.
They are apparently all addressed either to
Jemes Grenville, brother of Lady Chatham, or
to his son, James, Baron Glastonbury. The
catalogue by which these letters were ordered

names the Grenvilles as the addressees. The
letter of April 23, 1784, was printed by the
Fifth Earl Stanhope in his biography of Pitt,
and he gave the addressee as Glastonbury. In
several of these letters Pitt refers to But-

leigh which was the home o James Grenville
and his son. All of these eleven letters are
listed in the Autograph File as addressed to
one or the other of the Grenvilles, but the

catalogue is the only authority for this
judgment on some of them.

1778 to 1796, but the exact dates of four
items are undetermined. Pitt frequently men-
tions the health of his parents as well as
other personal matters. Politics is an im-

portant subjedt of several letters. On April
23, 178), Pitt discusses the developing parl-
iamentary election in Middlesex in which
Charles James Fox eventually wins a seat.
This election is disputed and is a noted pol-
itical incident. On August 7 and 31, 1792,

Pitt writes about getting a suitable parlia-
mentary replacement for Edward Phelips, re-
cently deceased, who sat from Somersetshire.
A possibility is Sir Thomas Dyke Acland who,
after considerable delay, decides not to be a

 
Pitt, William (729-1606) 25
candidate. Another candidate, | hbridge, is
then decided upon at the county meeting, but
his name does not appear as Phelip's succes-
sor. In 1795 another incumbent for Somerset-
shire dies, and Pitt discusses possible candi-
dates. Among them is William Gore Langton

who is elected in September. In an undated
letter Pitt reports the safe arrival of the
Baltic fleet and the good situation of the

forces at Gibraltar (Sept. 21, )- On’
May 17, 1796, he conveys the King's promise

er James Grenville becomes Baron Glastonbury.
Only one letter, dated only as Friday, is
addressed to the elder James Grenville, Pitt's
uncle.

There are two letters from Robert Smith,

First Baron Carrington, to unknown addressees.
Carrington was a friend of Pitt and owed his
peerage to him. On December 14, 1798, Car-
rington discusses his order for a telescope
from Sir William Herschel, astronomer. the

elescope is intended for Walmer Castie. He

mentions Pitt's good health and a report that
Bonaparte has been assassinated in Egypt. On
August 5, 1799, Carrington is waiting to view
the 12,000 troops that are assembled for an
assault on Holland. He mentions prominent

officials who are present and gives his fav-
orable impression of Mrs. Windham, apparently
the wife of William Windham, Secretary of
State for War. The telescope from Herschel
has arrived but is not yet operable.

item added, 9-1-62. This item is a copy,
probably contemporary, of a letter from the
Prince of Wales, later George IV, to Baron
Thurlow, Lord Chancellor, on January 2, 1789.
It is an answer to a letter from William Pitt
on December 30. The Prince of Wales is reply-
ing to Pytt’s proposals for a Regency Bill. At

this time George III is temporarily insane.

This addition iaeieaes six letters (1786-
1804) from William Pitt--three to Granville
Leveson-Gower, First Marquis of Stafford and

three to George Rose.
The Marquis of Stafford serves as Lord
Privy Seal from 1784 to 1794. Pitt's letters
to him date from 1787, 1788, and 1795.
On August 24, 1787, Pitt writes about the crisis

 
Pitt, William (1759-13806) 30

in the Netherlands where Britain and Prussia
are supporting the House of Orange and France

is backing its opposition. He discusses an
expected Prussian intervention and British sup
port for it and notes also that their friends in
the Netherlands will need further financial
assistance. Prussia soon succeeds with a mili-

 

tary intervention.

On November 6, 1788, Pitt conveys news and
anxiety about the serious illness of George III.
On November 5, the King became insane, and a

crisis soon arose over the Regency Question.

 
Pitt, William (1759-1806) 31

In 1795 there is great distress among the
poor because of two successive bad harvests.
On November 6 Pitt replies to Stafford's sugzes-
tions for ascertaining the stock of corn in the
country. Although Pitt realizes the difficulty
of obtaining accurate information without compul
sory legislation, he believes that such laws
would arouse too much antagonism. The govern-
ment will have to rely on information from the
magistrates.

George Rose serves as secretary to the

treasury in 1784-1801 and 1804 -1806. Pitt's

e

 

 
Pitt, William (1759-1806) ‘32
letters to Rose date from 1786, 1790, and 1804.
On January 7, 1804, Pitt reports his
immediate return to London. It is necessary
to determine the state of parties when the
House of Cemmons meets, and he notes the impor-
tance of the position now to be adopted.
In an undated letter Pitt discusses pensiong

 

for three persons--B. Watson, Sir G. Carlton,
and Sir Robert Boyd. Sir Robert Boyd received
his knighthoo@ in 1785 and died in 1794, so the
letter must belong within this period. In 1786
Sir Guy Carleton becomes First Baron Dorchester

 
Pitt, William (1759-1806) 33

 

and is gr anted an income during the lifetime of
himself and his wife and two of his children.
This information is recorded in William Wood,
The Father of British Canada (Toronto, 1935),
p. 162. Pitt mentions Carleton's wife and two
children, so the letter probably dated from
1786. Pitt also mentions accounts fron the
India House which he may need to cite on
Monday.

In another undated letter Pitt advises
Rose to settle immediately with Lord Scarsdale

about his retirement and pension, and he dis-

 

 
Pitt, William (1759-1806) 34
cusses possible arrangements for the pension.
Since Lord Scarsdale receives a pension in
1790, tunis letter may date from this year or
close to it. Scarsdale's pension is revorted
in George Edward Cokayne, The Complete .Peerage
» « «+ (London, 1910-1959), XI, 520.

5 items added, 1-23-67. There are copies
of three letters to Pitt from Richard Howe,
First Lord of the Admiralty. On Sept. 22,
1787 [?], Howe answered an inquiry about the
use of volunteers or impressed personnel in the

navye Two days later he discussed the circum-

stances of the promotion of Charles Middleton
to rear admiral and noted the precedents for
this action given by Middleton's predecessors
as comptrollers of the navy. In this letter and
in a succeeding one of Sept. 24 Howe criticized
Middleton's retention at the Navy Board and
asked for an assistant, either Henry Martin,
commissioner at Portsmouth or Capt. Fanshawe,
probably Robert Fanshawe (1739-1823).

On March 24, 1788, Dr. E. Raby at Grantham
assured a Mr. Stevenson of John, Lord Chatham's,
regard for him the and the probability of his

Thomas Merritt Pittman was born in 1857 in
Franklin County, North Carolina. He read law
in Charlotte and opened an office there in 1878.
In 1885, he moved to Henderson where he resided
until his death. He established a large legal

practice in Henderson and in 1923 was appointed
a state district judge for North Carolina.
His papers reflect his interest in the poli-
tical, social, and religious ai story of North
i

Carolina. None of them relates to

s law prac-

 
Pittman, Thomas Merritt 2
tice. He served as chairman of the North Caro-
lina Historical Commission and as president of
the North Carolina Literary and Historical Asso
ciation, and a number of items in this collec-
tion concern the activities of these two groups.
Pittman was particularly interested in the his-
tory of the Baptist Church in his state and
wrote several articles and speeches on this
topic. His research on the Baptists led him in
to a dispute with Joseph Blount Cheshire, bishop
of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of North
Carolina, who disagreed with Pittman's conclu-

 

 
Pittman, Thomas Merritt 3

sions concerning the early religious history o
North Carolina. Cheshire's letters to him refe
in part to their dispute, and Josephus Daniels
wrote to express his views on the matter. Sev-
eral manuscripts of articles and speeches writ-
__ by Pittman are concerned with church histor
also.

 

He was descended from Richard Bennett who
settled in Virginia in 1622. He was interested
in tracing his ancestry, and several correspon-
dents wrote asking for information on the Pitt-
man and Bennett families. Copies of his respon-

 
Pittman, Thomas Merritt 4
ses and a few items among the miscellaneous pa-
pers contain genealogical information.

As chairman of a committee appointed by the
North Carolina Bar Association, Pittman investi-
gated the feasibility of adopting the Torrens
system of land titles by the North Carolina
legislature. His papers indicate that he became
an ardent supporter of this system.

Several letters from Samuel A'Court Ashe con-
cern North Carolina history, particularly John
Porter's role in the Cary Rebellion during the

colonial period.

 

 
Pittman, Thomas Merritt 3
Pittman received an honorary degree from Wake
Forest College in 1925 and was a generous bene-
factor of that institution. His library, one
of the finest private libraries amassed by a
collector in North Carolina, is now housed there
He also collected manuscripts, and the oldest
items among his papers are from this collection.
Several of them concern the construction of a
Baptist church in Edenton, while others were
written by or to early Baptist clergymen. A
handsomely bound volume contains copies of the
correspondence of John Kennedy, Jr. who appar-

 

 
Pittman, Thomas Merritt 6
ently was a merchant in Washington, N. C. Writ
ten from 1788-to 1797, these letters are mainly
of a personal nature, though several of them
contain references to political affairs in Beau
fort County. Some of the copies are of letters
to Kennedy from Thomas Blount, a congressman
from North Carolina.

 

Copies of Pittman's articles and addresses
are arranged alphabetically for the longer works
and chronologically for the shorter ones. Among
them are manuscripts of his article on William
Woods Holden for Biographical History of North

Carolina, edited by Samuel A. Ashe, and on John
Porter, and several concerning other political
and religious topics.

Items related to Henderson and Vance County
are also included in this collection. A report
dated January 31, 1908, concerns the remodeling
of the county courthouse. Pittman was a member

 

of the Contemporary Club, alocal. scientific and
literary group, and his papers include minutes
of its meetings and schedules of its programs
for the years 1915 to 1917. Pittman's first ;
wife was active in the Tuesday Club. Several of

Captain Frank Lester Pleadwell (1872-1957)
naval surgeon, medical historian, and
manuscript collector, held many distinguished
appointments in his field. He entered the
United States Navy as assistant surgeon after

receiving his M. D. from Harvard University in
1896. On February 1, :°1918, he was appointed
to the rank of captain. During World War I

he served as special American medical observer
of the British medical services, April, 1916

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester 2

 

till 1917. He visited camps, hospitals,
ambulances, trains, hospital ships, etc. Dr.
Pleadwell became assistant naval attaché at the
American Embassy in London in 1917. After
service as aide to the commander of United
States naval forces in Europe and with the
Atlantic Fleet, he returned in 1921 to become
assistant in the Bureau of Medicine and
Surgery, Washington, D. C. During 1921-1922
he was president of the Association of
Military Surgeons. He served as head of the

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester 4

 

177 items, added 1-20-66, are personal
correspondence reflecting the career of Captain
Pleadwell from 1910 to 1953. There are a
number of series of letters from British
friends.

These begin in 1910 with Sir James Porter,
Surgeon General at the Admiralty, who comments
on politics, ventilation of hospital ships,
and his war service. He was succeeded as
Surgeon General by Sir Arthur William May
(1854-1925). His letters to Dr. Pleadwell

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester 5

 

concern naval medical transport during World
War I, which Pleadwell was observing. The
letter of September 23, 1916, comments on the
attempt of the British Red Cross to take
charge of the policy of the Royal Naval
Medical Service. Later, on December 8, 1916,
he discusses in a general way venereal diseases
in the British and United States Navies.

Dr. Pleadwell met Dr. A. Vavasour Elder of
the British naval medical service in 1916.
Dr. Elder served under Sir James Porter and

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester 6

 

Sir Arthur May. He arranged observation, trips
for Dr. Pleadwell. After the war the letters
resume from the Cedric, a British passenger
ship sailing into New York, from which Dr.
Elder writes of the retirement of many naval
medical men, especially of Sir James Porter.
Another series of letters comes from Major

General Richard Cleveland Munday (1867-1952),
a naval medical man who organized the Medical
Department of the Royal Air Force.

On June 9, 1916, Ernest Henry Starling

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester 7

 

(1866-1927) writes of a box respirator for
poison gas, while on November 1, 1916, Dr.
Kenneth Gowdby comments on gas gangrene,

It is unfortunate that these letters of
World War I do not have more content. Many of
the physicians involved, however, did publish
articles or books on war-time medical experi-

ences. Among Pleadwell's other correspondents
are Sir Thomas Lewis, Herbert Tilley, Surgeon
Rear Admiral Edward Sutton, Alexis Carrel, W.

L. Martin, Sir St. Clair Thomson, Victor Heiser,

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester

 

and Sir James Hodsden.

This brief glimpse of World War I is followed
by correspondence indicating a deepening
interest in medical history and a nostalgic
concern for British friends. Charles L. Dana,
Surgeon Rear Admiral David Walker Hewitt, and
Hugh Smith Cumming write briefly. On Nov. 7,
1920, Dr. Pleadwell himself wrote to Harvey
Cushing describing how Sir William Cesler
initiated the appointment of United States
medical observers with the British forces in

World War I.

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester _ 9

 

By 1920 the Pleadwell publications in medical
history begin, acknowledgements of the W. Pe. C.
Barton biography coming from Isadore Dyer and
William Williams Keen, Jr. Letters come from
Horace Manchester Brown concerning his activ-
ities as a collector of medical history
materials. Glentworth R. Butler, James S.

Taylor, Henry Barton Jacobs, Edgar Montagu
Pilcher, and William Sydnor Thayer continue
the Pleadwell correspondence.

One of the most pleasing and revealing series

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester 10

 

of letters begins on November 22, 1922, when
Surgeon Rear Admiral Charles Marsh Beadnell
(1872-1947) writes after a meeting with Dr.
Pleadwell. The latter was president of the
association of military surgeons. The Beadnell
letters give a glimpse of the retirement of a
British naval surgeon as well as the English
during World War II. This friendship lasted
until Dr. Beadnell's death.

A short series of letters by Francis
Randolph Packard comments on medical history,

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester LL

 

referring to Dr. Edward Cutbush, to The Annals
of Medical History, and to the death of Sir
Humphrey Davy Rolleston.

Correspondence continues from Frederick
Cheyne Shattuck, Joseph L. Miller, William
Snow Miller, Richard Strong Pearson, and
William Royal Stokes.

 

D'Arcy Power is asked in 1924 by Dr.
Pleadwell for data on Dr. Ninian Pinckney.
He was writing and publishing Pinckney's
biography. Fielding Garrison comments in 1926

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester Lz

 

on this, together with Harvey Cushing's life of
Sir William Osler.

In 1926 Pleadwell also published a study of
Joseph Rodman Drake, Archibald Malloch
comments on this production.

Also writing in the 1920's are Edgar Montagu
Pilcher, David Linn Edsall, George C. Peachey,
on Matthew Baillie's diary, G. Brown Miller,
and Lewis Stephen Pilchey.

In the early 1930's come letters from
Frederic Wood Jones, Edwin Allen Locke,

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester 13

 

William Shailine Middleton, Robert Peristein,
Horace M. Stephens, and Arturo Castiligione.
On June 20, 1936, Edward Archibald writes
of Sir Joseph Lister.
A meeting of the Congress of Medical
Historians was held at Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia,
in the fall of 1938. Dr. John Comrie of the

University of Edinburgh met Dr. Pleadwell there.
Later he commented on his trip home by way of
the University of Leyden. Hermann Boerhaave
had served at Leyden after receiving medical

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester

 

training under Archibald Pitcairne at Edinburgh,
When the Medical Department at Edinburgh
opened, all its original faculty except one
were pupils of Boerhaave.

At this point the shadow of Hitler begins
to be evident. Dr. Comrie writes that he was
ordered during the Munich crisis to open a

recruiting medical board within forty-eight
hours after a declaration of war. He describes
German Jews, Czechs, and Austrians who are

refugees in England.

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester

 

Henry Ernest Sigerist comments on Feb. 29,
1939, on the Munich crisis. He explains on
May 17, 1944, that he is acting as librarian
of the Institute of Medical History during the
war.

Dr. Pleadwell had served as head of the nava
hospital at Pearl Harbor and returned to
Honolulu upon his retirement. He left no
manuscripts referring to the Japanese attack
upon the naval base in 1941. The last of his
correspondence concerns medical history. Lewis

 
Pleadwell, Frank Lester 16

 

Moorman writes on June 7, 1949, on the cause
of Votaire's death. Other letters come from
Edgar Erskine Hume, Winfred Overholser, Robert
M. Green, John Cummin, James W. Nixon, J.
Vernon Luck, and Edmund W. Clap. Undated are
letters from James S. Taylor and Jonathan
Campbell Meakins.

Dr. Pleadwell died at the age of eighty-five
in Honolulu. Undoubtedly his collection of
medical manuscripts forms the basis of much
of the Trent Collection.

The letter dated October 3, 1857, is from
Plimpton to "Curtis." Plimpton was listed
as a merchant in the New York City Directory,
1858-59. The letter déscribed the economic

 

panic of 1857 as it was felt in New York
City. Plimpton said, "Nothing has ever been
known like the present crisis within the mem-
ory of our our oldest businessmen,..We have
pd. 25,000 dols today ourselves but thank

 
Plimpton, John. G 2
God we had the ability. There will be several
large failures today."

Obviously Curtis was a friend because
Plimpton reported on his mother and others
who were probably members of his family. He
also mentioned other mutual acgqaintances who
were businessmen.
