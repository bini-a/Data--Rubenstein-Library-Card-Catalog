The family papers’ of Clarke Rice, Yryden,
Cortland Co., N. Y.,and Sebewa, Ionia Co.,
Mich., center in the letters of his son, Henry
Oscar, and of his brether Daniel of N. Y. The
family letters from N. Y: and Mich. reveal farm
life in the 1820's, the 1850's, and at the close
of the Civil War. Henry Oscar Rice enlisted
in the 9th Mich. Vols. in 1861 and wrote from
West Point Camp on the Ohio River and Camp Hay-
craft, Elizabeth Town, Ky., revealing monoto-
nous camp life, health conditions, and weather

Conditions while they were in winter quarters,
1861-1862. Early 1862 brings comment on the
new Austrian rifles, the Minie rifle, and the
promotion of Col. Wm. Duffield to brigadier
general. The 8th and 10th Kentucky, the 7th
Pa., and 3rd Minn. Vols. are mentioned. The
letters end on Mar. 9, 1862, when they are
about to march on Nashville. Henry Oscar Rice
died sometime before Oct., 1863, when his fathe
receives bounty and claims from the U. S. Govt.

Wiggins, S.C. 13,581 items Sketch
"This collection consists almost entirely
of personal correspondence of James Henry Rice,
Jr, (1868-1935), South Carolina naturalist, con-
servationist, and local historian. The bulk off
material falls within the years 1910-1935, and
it consists almost entirely of personal letters.

 

There is a relatively small amount of printed

matter, documents, clippings, and snapshots, The
letters may be grouped into three main classifi-
cations: correspondence with national conserva-
tion and wildlife organizations concerning pres-

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 2

 

ervation of fauna in South Carolina and the en-
tire Southeast, along with letters to prominent
conservationists; correspondence dealing with
the history and contemporary politics of South
Carolina and, on a smaller scale, correspondence
relative to national politics; and personal cor-
respondence involving family and business af-

fairs seasoned by frequent discussions of devel-
opments in literature and journalism. Much of
the correspondence in this last group also re-
lates to Rice's personal interest in some phases
of conservation and politics. In using the Rice

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. fs)

 

Papers one needs to realize that Rice was per-
haps more idealistic than the average person
about himself, about others, and about matters
in general.

Rice corresponded with a number of notable na-
tional figures and almost all of the individuals
prominent in South Carolina from ca. 1910-1935,

including Benjamin’ R, Tillman, James’ F, Byrnes,

from Théodore Roosevelt, Smuts, Lord Derby and
Alfred Russell Wallace. Many of the letters,
especially those from the more prominent persons,
are not as historically valuable as the mame of

Rice, James Henry, Jr.. 8
James Henry Rice, Jr., was a man of some
intellectual attainment in natural science, in
the study of South Carolina history, and in the
history and natural features of South America,
His father, James Henry Rice (1838-1910), a grad
uate of Furman University, Harvard Law School,
and a student at Oxford University, was the own-

 

er of a large plantation and Superintendent of
Public Schools in South Carolina in the 1880's,
Annie Lawton Rice, the mother of James Henry
Rice, Jr., was the daughter of William Lawton,
&@ planter in Georgia and South Carolina. James

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 9
Henry Rice, Jr. graduated from the University a
South Carolina in 1886; then taught in the pub-
lic schools. He also served as superintendent
of schools in many South VYarolina towns, but
left S. C, in 1886 for South America where he
represented the Winchester Arms Co. Hice return
ed to S. C,. in the 1890's, edited the Columbia
(S.C.) Evening Newa in 1895, assisted in edit-
ing the Colonial Records of South Carolina(1895
and wrote editorials as staff member of the Co-
(S.C.)_ State, 1896-1898. He edited the
Field, an industrial weekly, 1903-1904, and, in

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 10

 

1905-1906, the Carolina Field published at
Georgetown, S.C. Rice became a leading figure
in the conservation movement in South Carolina
as Secretary of the State Audubon Society, 1907-
1910, and Field Representative of the National
Association of Audubon Societies, 1910-1913.
From 1911-1913 he was also chief game warden of

 

South Carolina. The material in the Rice Papers
is, as noted above, rather limited for the en--
tire period up to 1910. The bulk of the commun-
ications consists of instructions to Rice from
officials of the South Carolina Audubon Society,

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. pies
especially M. O. Dantzler, president; and from
William Dutcher and T. Gilbert Pearson, presi-
dents of the National Association of Audubon So-
cieties, as to policies of the two groups toward
possible conservation legislation, enforcement
of existing regulatory laws, and prosecution of
violators,

 

The most revealing letters from a man of
prominence are those from Benjamin R. Tillman.
This correspondence begins in 1905 and continues
in 19 letters through 1918. A letter of May 22,
1905, contains the Senator's opinion as to the
chances of survival, ‘@ original form, of

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 12
the South Carolina Dispensary System, with addi-
tional references to the menace of Japan and the
yellow peril. There are allusions in many of
the Tillman letters to Governor Coleman L.

Blease and the Bleasites of 8.C., possible chal-
lengers to Tillman's political supremacy in the
state. Rice himself exchanged sharp letters
with Blease over what Rice called the Governor's
appointment of "political hacks" to positions as
local game wardens. (See Blease's letters of June
3, 1911 and Jan. 31, 1913). Tillman also refers,
sometimes jocosely and with evident satire, some-

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 13
times crudely but nearly always effectively, to
Washington activities and personalities. TIllus-
trative examples are Tillman's disenchantment at
William Jennings Bryan's necessity for maintain-
ing a highly comfortable standard of living
(letter of Jan. 28, 1916), his description of
Sen. John Sharp William's speech delivered while
drunk in the Senate (letter of Mar. 28, 1918),
Tillman's waning ardor for that great abstract-
ion "Jeffersonian Democracy," and his support fo
Wilson's Mexican policy in — (letters of
Feb. 3 and Mar. 8, 1916). urning to the South

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 14

 

Carolina scene, Tillman explains his position on
C.G. Wyche's possible betrayal of Tillman's con-
fidence, records his observations on the South
Carolina legislature in 1914, the possibility

of ending Free Range (no fences; livestock free
to roam) in South Carolina, and his support of
President Riggs of Clemson College (letters of
Mar. 5 and 6, 1914).

By the time of the First World War Rice was
spending more of his own time at his home, Brick
House Plantation near Wiggins, Colleton County,
S.C. His correspondence is therefore preserved

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 15

 

in a larger amount from this period on. Rice
Married Jennie Maner in 1892 and reared seven
children at the plantation: James Henry Rice III
Edward Carew Rice, Magaret Rice Patterson (Mrs.
James L.), William Lawton Rice, Samuel Maner
Rice (known as Bud, killed in hunting accident,
1911), Frederick Rice, and Robert Ridgway Rice.
The family history of his children and grand-
children is given to Ruckstull in a letter of
Apr.27, 1928, and subsequent letters give family
background,

South Carolinians often requested Rice to

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 16

 

employ his "facile pen" in the production of
family histories and biographies. To provide
part of the family income he began writing
sketches, historical, genealogical, and ornitho-
logical, for South Carolina newspapers. In ad-
dition to his own collected historical data,
Rice received from his correspondents a number

of family historical sketches when he was writ-
ing, in 1922-23, a series of articles, "The Pal-
adins of South Carolina," for the Columbia
(S.C.) State. Rice's other published volumes
were Glories of the Carolina Coast and the

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 17

 

Aftermath of Glory (1934 ; illustrated with
scissors silhouettes by Edward Carew Rice), two
books dealing with the beauty, potentiality for
development, and history of the South Carolina
coast. The "family-history" letters include a
series from members of the Gary family, chiefly
Judge E.B. Gary, giving information on Martin W.
Gary, a Democratic upCcountry leader in the Red-
shirt Campaign of 1876. Judge Gary has an in-
teresting account of Martin W. Gary at Edgefield
during the campaign, (letter of July,2, 1910).
Former Gov. John C. Shepphard, another campaign

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 1s
participant, gives brief references to the Red-
shirts and denies that the "Republican" State
House of Representatives facetiously elected
Judge Wallace, leader of the contending Democra-
tic faction, to.the speakership (letters. of. July
7, 12, Aug. 5, Nov. 24, 27, 1922).

From 1913-1917 Rice was an inspector for

 

the U.S. Biological Survey and was more closely
associated than heretofore with national figures
in conservation and wildlife: ornithologists
Robert Ridgway, E.H. Forbush, and William Brew-
ster and officials at the National Museum in

 
Rice, James Henry, dr. 19

 

Washington, including Charles W. Richmond, who
explains the personnel of the Museum, Nov. 20,
1929, The correspondence between Rice and these
individuals is, as may be expected, largely of
a nature interesting only to ornithologists and
naturalists: discussions of breeding grounds,
habitats, etc. of wildlife, and current litera-
ture in biology. The same is true of Rice's
long correspondence with Arthur Trezevant Wayne,
author of Birds of South Carolina. His corres-
pondence with William Chambers Coker of Chapel
Hill from 1927 to 1935 is primarily concerned

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 20

 

with identification of certain botanical speci-
mens,

Rice was a consistent advocate of more ex-
tensive development of the South Carolina coast-
al regions and the possibilities of profitable
truck farming along the coast, The Tillman let-
ters contain references to coastal development.

Rice's letters to George F. Mitchell, a former
U.S. Government official, urge the commercial
production on the South Carolina coast of yaupon
or Cassina tea, a project in which Mitchell be-
comes engaged. Hugh Lawson Oliver, a South

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 21

 

Carolina legislator, explains to Rice in letters
of Feb. 20 and Mar. 1, 1921, the maneuvers in
the State legislature regarding the passage of a
stock range law in 1920-1921 and Oliver's part
in the drive against Free Range, a movement
backed heartily by Rice; Letters from George R.
Koester, a Columbia reporter during the Tillman
movement of the 1890's and later editor of the
Greenville (8.C.) Piedmont, and Harry Legare’
Watson, editor of the Greenwood (S C.) Index-
Journal, also pertain to stock law legislation
and state politics, Koester was the manager of

 

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. ee

 

Oscar Kern Mauldin's campaign for the Democratic
nomination for 1lt.-gov. in 1920. Rice's own
letters give one access to the ideas of a self-
professed admirer of many of the antebellun
aristocratic values, an earnest advocate of
traditional Protestant Christian theology based
on study of the Bible, and a somewhat caustic

critic of much modern "foolishness," such as
Prohibition, the fame of William J. Bryan, and
the corrupting influence of the uneducated mass-
eg upon public institutions, Rice advocated

"Justice" for the Negro although he was by no

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 25

 

definition an exponent of Negro equality. An
interesting view of Southern ideas about treat-.
ment of Negroes just prior to 1920 is brought
out in the letters of Judge George W. Gage, who
leans a bit toward Rice's point of view but
blasts Oswald Garrison Villard and other "North-
ern Radicals;" and another South Csrolinian,
Charleston lawyer W.H. Parker, who sees no ac-
tual mistreatment of the Negro taking place
(letterzof Oct..16, 1919). Judge Gage also
gives his idea.of the distinct periods of South
Carolina history, prewar, Civil War.and Recon-

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 24

 

struction, and the postwar "redemption" capped
by “i Tillman Movement (letters of Oct. 13, 14,
1919).

Rice, well-read and widely travelled, cors-
responded with a number of literary and academic
figures. The letters of Marie Conway Oemler of
Savannah, Ga., contain references to the writing
of her Slippy McGhee and other novels, and to
her relations with her publishers, The Century
Co. Archibald Rutledge's letters refer briefly
to plantation life in the old South and to his
father, Col. Henry M. Rutledge (letter of Dec.

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 25

 

7, 1922). The short letters of Kenneth Roberts
are devoid of literary matters. The correspon-
dence of Rice and Harriette Kershaw Leiding has
discussions of the criticisms visited upon Mrs,
Leiding's book, Historic Houses of South Caro-
lina (1921). In Oct. 1928 he sends a lengthy

letter to Mrs. W.H. Keith describing that work.
The correspondence with Dubose Heyward and John
Bennett are largely concerned with the meetings
and organization of the Poetry Society of South
Carolina, with references to Amy Lowell's visit

to Charleston, A letter from William Peterfield

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 26
Trent (June 15, 1924) outlines for Rice's bene-
fit the intent and purposes of the author's

A History of American Literature, his attitude
toward the historical culture of the South, and
his disagreement with Rice's contention that the
majority of S.C. planters were anti-secessionist.
Letters from Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, well-
known linguist and classical scholar, thank Rice
for the latter's interest in his work and ex-
press Gildersleeve's feelings toward the South
{letters of Nov. 15, Dec. 3, 1923). Prof. Yates
Snowden of the University of South Carolina has

 

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 27

 

a@ memoir on Paul Hamilton Hayne (May 28, 1921).
His poem, "A Carolina Bourbon," is also mention-
ed (Apr. 8, 1926). Letters from Ambrose E. Gon-
zales refer to his Black Border and his other
"Gullah" novels. Those from Herbert Ravenel
Sass discuss Sass' natural history articles and
the natural history of the Charleston region,
The aforementioned Paladin series, intended
to "preserve for posterity" sympathetic accounts
of South. Garolina leaders, ca. 1860-1890, was
based to a large extent on family recollections
and records as communicated to Rice. Dr; .Francis

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 28
Wilkinson Pickens Butler, of Columbia, 5.C0., son
of Senator Matthew Calbraith Butler, endeavored,
in a series of letters, to refute some of the
accusations concerning his father's private life.
The younger Butler denied that his father's pri-
vate life in Washington was morally lax, explain
ing that the truth concerning his friendship for
the woman he later married was distorted by the
Tillmanites, who actually had spies observing
Senator Butler in Washington. He also relates
the "facts" concerning Senator Butler's conver-
sion to Roman Catholicism (letter of Sept. 10,

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 29
1922), Butler's importance in the Redshirt Cam-
paign of 1876 in writing to Hampton persuading
him to lead the Democratic forces, and the cir-
cumstances surrounding Butler's entrance into

the U.S, Senate-- Butler was seated through the
influence of Simon Cameron, former Senator from
Pa., Sec. of War under Lincoln, and friend of

 

Sen. Butler's father, working through the in-
fluence of his son, Sen. Don Cameron (letter of
June 25, 1922). A.F.W.P. Butler's letter of
Nov. ©, 1922, enclosing a letter from-C.E. Saw-
yer (Oct. 26, 1922), gives a personal account of

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 50

 

the Edgefield trial of the South Carolina Red-
shirts in 1876. The role of Leroy F. Yoamans

in the Redemption Movement is described by his
son-in-law, W.A,. Metts (Dec. 7, 1922). Columbia
banker W.A. Clark, active in the '76 campaign,
contends that Hampton knew, despite legends to
the contrary, that Negroes were kept from voting
by intimidation or force. Clark minimizes Hamp-
ton's role in 1876 and emphasizes that of Judge
Haskell and Martin W. Gary, He adds that Hamp-
ton's life in Washington was immoral:({letter
Feb. 5, 1923). B.F. Taylor adds a further note

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. ol
On Hampton's wounds (Feb. 4, 1923).

Rice's correspondence with Gen. C. Irvine
Walker, Confederate biographer of Gen. Richard
H. Anderson, ©0.S.A., is largely confined to ob-
servations about the problems of local histori-
ans in gathering and organizing source material.
Gen. Walker relates some anecdotes about Bragg's

 

Kentucky Campaign (Oct. 5, 1924), and reminiscen
ces concerning Gens. M.L, Bonham, Wade Hampton,
and J.E. Johnston,(Dec. 27, 1922). There are
also less informative letters from Ann Catherine
Saunders, Gen. Anderson's neice. For Gen. Walk-

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr.

 

er's benefit, Rice recalls his own meetings with
Jefferson Davis, alludes to the Confederate Pres
ident's controversy with Gen. J.E. Johnston, and
the arguments between Gov. F.W, Pickens of South
Carolina and President Davis (Rice's letter to
Walker, Jan. 4, 1923). Rice also repeats ina
number of his own letters the charge that Davis
disregarded the offer of Fraser, Trenholm & Co.
of Charleston to purchase Brifish ships for Con-
federate service.

The postwar land booms of the 1920's not
only touched off a spectacular speculation in

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr.

 

Florida real estate; it intensified the efforts
of budding land development companies along the
South Carolina coast. Rice apparently held a

sizeable amount of stock in one of these compan-
ies, the Chee-Ha Combahee Co., and acted as its
agent in attempting to interest Northern capital
ists in developing large tracts along the South
Carolina coast. His own letters of 1921-1922

and many of those from his correspondents are

concerned with plans for land development. Rice
discussed plans for the settlement of Dutch fam-
ilies in the region around Charleston with John

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 54

 

L.C. Dremes, Netherlands consul at Charleston
and J.C.A. Everwijn, the Dutch Ambassador in
Washington. These plans were apparently never
implemented. In 1925, Rice became involved in a
plan to put out publicity for the development of
the Myrtle Beach-Grand Strand area of South Car-
Olina, and apparently had some influence in the

@ecision of the Woodsides of Greenville to in-+-
vest heavily in development of the Beach, Their
various plans are described in letters of 1926.
He also phayed a large part in organizing the
Conservation Society of South Carolina and was

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 55

 

its first president. Rice's correspondence for
this period, ca. 1925, is to a large extent con-
cerned with plans for directing and financing
publicity campaigns to push development and the
tourist trade,

with several individuals Rice maintained a
lengthy correspondence which was largely con-

fined to personal news, interspersed with opin-
ion on political and historical matters, Fred-
erick Wellington Ruckstull, the sculptor of the
Wade Hampton statue at Columbia and the statues
of Hampton and John C. Calhoun in Statuary Hall,

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 56
Washington, exchanged with Rice views on current
political questions during the Wilson, Harding,
Coolidge, Hoover, and F,D.R, administrations,
Ruckstull mentions that his friendship with Bain
bridge Colby, Wilson's last Secretary of State,
has increased both his (Ruckstull's) sympathy
for Wilson in the League of Nations-fight and
the shortsightedness of those around Lodge, a
point of view decidedly opposite to that of Rice.
Rice also upholds the Harding administration and
mentions that he talked with Harding in the
White House while representing South Carolina at

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. ay 37
the Presidential inaugural. Ruckstull's editor-
ship of the short-lived Art World, his proposed
autobiography- Into Hell And Out Of It, Lights
and Shadows of the Art World (title later chang-
ed to 38 Years in Sculpture) and his College
Cruise Around the World in 1927, are other inter
ests discussed in the correspondence, In 1926
he wrote to Ruckstull about his father's speech
on education at Erskine College in 1879.
Ruckstull gives his opinion of Albert Si-
mons, architect of Ribault Fort monument, his
Opposition to modernistic art, and in 1927 much

 

 

 

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr.

of their correspondence is concerned witn get-
ting Ruckstull appointed sculptor for the Wade
Hampton statue, although a letter of Mar. 12 to
Ruckstull also details bank failures in S.C. On
Aug. 15, Ruckstull sends a copy of his speech
before the Rotary Club of Sumter, S.C., and on
Sept..5, Ruckstull compares Gutzon Bonglum and

 

Augustus Lukeman's plans for the controversial
Stone Mountain project. Reférred to also is a
letter from J. Wilson Gibbes (Sept. 10). Ellen
Nixon Nyes's poetry comes in for criticism from
Ruckstull (Nov. 9), as does H. L. Mencken inApr
1928. In May, cre anc tells what he knows a-

bout his ancestors an writes of nis father's

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. og
religious devotion, against which he has rebel-
led by becoming a humanist. Rice's desperate
family situation is the subject of corresponde ,
ence between Gibbes and Ruckstull, November 1928
In 1929, Ruckstull is busy trying to get a new
Statuary Hall, and unsuccessfully seeks a com-
mission for a memorial to the defenders of Fort

 

Sumter, inspite of his belief that judges from
the National Sculpture Society will not choose
him. In May 1930, Rice describes the beauty and
and healthfulness of Summerville to Ruckstull,
The economic depression receives much attention

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 40

 

from Ruckstull from this date on and bewails the
inadeauacy of the government to solve the prob-
lem (Dec. 12, 1930). Ina series of letters of
1931, Ruckstull states his belief that the sol-
ution to the world's ills lies in the U.S, join-
ing the League of Nations and dominating it, fin
ishing his discourse with a strong, frank letter

of February 17, 1932. In Sept. 1933, Ruckstull
contends that Franklin Delano Roosevelt came in
with a 300d moderate program just in time to
stem a revolution, and-tells that he is at work
on a bust of Nicholas Murray Butler.

 
 

Rice, James Henry,Jdr. 41
The letters of ornithologists Hobert Ridg-
way, A.T, Wayne, W.T. Hornaday, first director
of the Bronx Zoo, and editor Robert Lathan are
also largely of the nature of social correspond-
ence, Wayne gives an interesting sketch of Dr.
Francis Peyre Porcher, famous South Carolina
naturalist (Jan. 24, 1923). Patrick Calhoun has
an analysis of the postwar economic recession
and his own remedy (letter of Dec. 20, 1920).
The letters of Frank M. Chapman, naturalist and
Carl E. Akely, the explorer, contain opinions
and recollections that one might assume would

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 42
enliven pages passing between friends. Mrs.
Akely tells of ner husband's death, June 27,
1927, Judge W.C. Benet, a veteran observer of
the South Carolina scene, has an anecdote con-
cerning Gen. Johnson Hagood, C.S.A. (letterJJan.
30, 1925), an assertion that he (Benet) gavy
Theodore Roosevelt the word "muck-racker" (let-

 

ter of Jan. 26, 1924), and several stories on
William H, Trescot. Rice:-is able to add stories
of his own concerning Trescot, Assistant Secre-
tary of State under Buchanan, Ridgway tells of
growing interest in preserving the natural

 
James Henry, Jr,
beauty in Illinois, partly through his help, and
he is working on Birds of North and Middle Amer
ica. He also discusses tne loss of virgin for
est -— wild life in Richland Co., Ill. (Mar. 5,
1926).

Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, ecologist and author of
Ine Negro: A Beast (1902) discusses, in letters
to Rice, natural history with anti-Negro over~
tones. Charles Spaulding Wylly, a local Georgia
historian, gives his recollections of Lucy Hol-
combe Pickens, wife of F. W. Pickens, United

States Ambassador to Russia and Ggy. of S.C. in
1860, and her daughter Dousnka Pickens.

The letters of South Carolina Congressmen
W. Turner Logan, Asbury F. Lever, R.S. Whaley,
and James F. Byrnes and Senators Ellison D,
Smith and Nathaniel Dial appearing in the Rice
Papers are almost entirely answers to Rice's
requests for information on agricultural and
zoological publications of the Federal Govern-

ment. Letters from Bernard Baruch and Gen. John
son Hagood are,with little exception, courteous
replies to Rice's letters. Baruch, in a letter
of Mar. 19, 1921, agrees with Rice that at pre-
sent no more people should be brought into South

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 45

 

Carolina. Gen. Hagood, in connection with Rices
article, "The Three Hagoods," in the Paladin
series, gives brief notes on the Hagood family
(Dec. 31, 1924). A letter from J.W, Brunson
(Oct. 25, 1921), recalls life at Furman Univer-
sity, 1858-1860, and early reaction to the out-
break of the Civil War. Congressman A.F, Leyer
discusses his chances for the South Carolina
governorship in a letter of Mar. 2, 1922. Harry
A. Slattery, a South Carolinian serving as Assis
tant to the Secretary of the Interior and a fig-
ure of some note in uncovering the Teapot Dome

scandal, informs Rice that he is fighting Secre-
tary of the Interior Albert B. Fall to keep the
Forestry Service in the Agriculture Department
and out of the Department of the Interior (let-
ter of Mar. 31, 1922). An estimate of Fall's
character, his desire to please people, by Judge
Mayo E. Hickey of New Mexico, is in a letter. to
Rice (April 23, 1921) from John Nicholson John-
son, a South Carolinian who went to New Mexico
in search of a cure for tuberculosis, after a
career in telegrapnhy and as an associate of
Thomas A Edison, Rice and Johnson maintained a

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 47

 

a lengthy correspondence until the latter's
death in 1923. In numerous letters to his other
correspondents, Rice maintained that Johnson had
offered to the United States Government, with
Edison's support, a valuable idea for a long
range gun to be used in World War I before the
Germans developed their own long distance artil-

lery. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, said
Rice, had turned down the plan, although Johnson
submitted it to the Naval Bosrd (plans of the
gun are given in Johnson's letter to Rice, April

13, 1918).

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 48

 

Through F.W.P. Butler, Rice began a corres-
pondence with Francis Butler Simkins, Jr., the
Southern Historian and biographer. Butler
sketches Simkins's background and early career
(letter of Nov. 15, 1921). Rice was generally
critical of parts of Simkins's work, especially
an article in the South Atlantic Quarterly on

the South Carolina election of 1876 which pic-
tured Wade Hampton as being "narrow" in charact-
er. Simkins replying to Rice's criticism in a
Nov. 8, 1922 letter to F.W.P. Butler, says that
Hamoton was narrow only in the sense that White,

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 49

 

Episcopal, wealthy Southerners are narrow. He
also says that Southerners must work more toward
@ scientific history rather than continuing the
traditional patriotic history. Simkins sent to
Rice a reprint of another Sé6uth Atlantic Quarter
dy article, "Latin American Opinion of Pan-Ameri
canism," along with comments (Nov. 24, 1923) on
his growing interest in South American history,
his friendship with the Brazilian scholar Gil-
berto Freyre, and his plans for a book on the
dictators of South America. In response to
Rice's questioning the historical "ereatness" of

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 50

 

Bolivar, Blanco, and B.R. Tillman, Simkins gave
his own definition of individual greatness: in
general, men are great whose influence is great-
greatness being "bold plans executed by genius
so as to leave their imprint on the times" (let-
ter of Feb. 28, 1925). Rice, commenting on the
Tillman movement, states that J.L.M. Irby, a
Tillman leader, had planned to assassinate Till-
man at the Constitutional Convention of 1896,
that Tillman had urged the appointment of James
Henry Rice, Sr. as U.S. Commissioner of Educa-
tion on President Cleveland in 1890, and that

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. SL

 

Tillman sounded out James Henry Rice, Jr. about
running for governor of South Carolina in 1898

The "Bushmen" of Colleton County frequently
set fire to Rice's woods, partly to gain free
grazing and partly, according to Rice (Nov. 15,
1930), because of his fight against Free Range.

As a naturalist and conservationist he was in-
terested in the wise use of §.C.'s forests, as
his correspondence with Nelson Courtlandt Braun,
State Foresters Lewis E. Staley (1928-1931) ana
H.A. Smith (May 23 and Sept. 27, 1932), W.R.

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 52

 

Mattoon of the U.S. Forest Service, and Horace
L. Tilghman shows. Tilghman praises F.D.R.'s
Reforestation Project in a letter of Apr. 7,
1933. Charles L.Travert (Aug. 10, 1928) tells
that he induced Carl Alvin Schenck of the Bilt-
more Forest School to spend two summers at his
forest nursery.

A telegram from W.T. Hornaday (May 15,
1926) describes the Conservation fight in Con-
gress. Starting in Jan. 1929, Hornaday is ac-
tively engaged in a fight to limit the number
of ducks permitted annually to each hunter, his

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr.

 

battle gaining momentum as he enlists Rice's
help to win Southern Congressmen over to the
Norbeck Bill, and in a letter of August 3 he
discusses the relationship between the Duponts
and various other arms and ammunition manufac-
turers to the American Game Protective Associa-
tion. During the month there is a rapid corres-
pondence between Rice and Hornaday in which
Davis Quinn joins, listing names and addresses
of men who own hunting preserves on the S.C.
coast. One of Hornaday's letters urges these
men to support a bag limit on ducks. In one of

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr.
these letters Rice severely criticizes Bernard
Baruch. The DuPonts had appeared in a letter to
John A. Garner, Apr. 29, 1926.

In the latter months of 1930 several let-
ters from Francis Harper, zoologist, say that
T. Gilbert Pearson, Pres. of the National Asso-
ciation of Audubon Societies, has apvarently

 

sola out to the gun and ammunition people and
gets a commission on Audubon dues collected
(Sept. 14), and that the committee appointed
(Nov. 14 letter from Davis Quinn) to investigate
the Audubon Society is a frame-up dominated by

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 55
Thomas Barbour, director of the museum in Cam-
bridge, Mass. (Nov. 30 and Dec. 10, 1930). Mrs.
Alice B. Harringron of Boston, in letters of Nov.
and Dec., 1930, défends Dr. Barbour, and Alex-
ander Sprunt, Jr. defends Pearson (Mar. 31, 1931)
A final letter from Hornadsy Mar. 25, 1931, sum-
marizes developments in Congress. Ina letter

 

to W.P. Blackwell (Dec. 5, 1930), Rice attacks
Pearson and Nelson of the U.S. Biological Sur-
vey and the hunters who ship hundreds of ducks
out of S.C. In 1934 a letter from Edward Avery
MeIlhenny, the bird protector of Avery Island,

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 56

 

Louisiana, gives a further unfavorable opinion
of Pearson (Nov. 13).

Another correspondent of Rice is the bota-
nist Dr. William Trelease, whose visit to Wac-
camaw Neck, Rice mentions in a letter of Mar. 28,
1926, to H.L. Mencken, in which he also gives the
history of Waccamaw Neck. A few days later, in
@ letter to Bernard Baruch, Rice describes the
pitiable condition of S.C. agriculture, blaming
much of it on Clemson College, and mentions a
truck ferming colony that came to Horry County
in 1898. The demands of the S.C. Conservation

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr.

 

Society are presented, and a bill just killed by
the legislature described in an April letter to
to Nelson Courtlandt Braun. This is followed by
a description of Colleton County sent to Marion
Salley. In the same month a letter from R.H.
McAdams agrees that the college block hinders

educational development in the State, and Rice
sends a list of members of the Conservation So-
ciety and a description of the struggle between
Conservationists and Free Range advocates to
W.J. McGlothlin. Other letters to Dr. McGloth-
lin discuss the public schools of §.C., and on

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr,

Apr. 15, 1926, he discusses Basil Gildersleeve
and William Moultrie. An interesting letter to
Charles M, Hite (Apr. 28) gives Rice's family
history, mentions that many fine young men, in-
cluding Solomon Green, had to leave the state
during Reconstruction as a result of their Ku
Klux Klan activities, and discusses the first
Huguenot minister to S.C.; Senator Mathew W.
Ransom of N.C., who originated the name "Sar
Heels"; Nathaniel Macon; Wharton J. Green of
Fayetteville, N.C., who was on R. E. Lee's Staff
and Woodrow Wilson's Marriage to the Widow Galt,

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 59
On Apr. 1 he traced Pocahontas's descendents to
the Lawton family for Mr. Hite. In 1928 (Apr. 1)
he wrote a three-page letter giving his reasons
why Woodrow Wilson was not the greatest man who
ever lived.

reply of June 13 tells of a visit to Ridgway
from Orpheus M. Schautz, Pres. of the Illinois
Audubon Society, and in Aug. Rice sends an obit-
uary of Ambrose Gonzales to Ridgway.

Numerous letters come to Rice for informa-
tion on local and natural history, as well as on
conservation. Among these are letters from
State Senator James H. Hammond and R.E. Currin
of the Pee Dee Experiment Station, requesting
data on conservation (June 3 and 15, 1926).
There are letters from Joseph W. Barnwell regard
ing Barnwell genealogy and property and from

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 61
Eva Pierce Mellichamp on the Carew genealogy
(Dec. 1926 and Jan. 1937); and from Mrs. Melli-
champ, mentioning the great 1860 fire in Charles
ton. Mrs; William Basil King starts a contro-
versy in April 1927 as to whether Sunny Side
house-was built for Theodosia Burr Alston, and
in July S.A. Rutherford of Hailey, Idaho, asks
for background material to use in his proposed
book to-be set in the St. Helena Sound region.
Katherine Drayton Simons wishes an article by
Rice for the first edition of her paper, the

Summerville Forester. Her subsequent defeat

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 62
of Dorchester County's political boss, J.B. Lime-
house, is described in a letter to Ruckstull
(Sept. 2, 1928), and in the same month Miss
Simons emphatically states that she and the Dor-
chester Riddance League support Al Smith. Daisy
Lee Stuckey asks Rice to write an epitaph for
the monument: to J. Marion Sims (Sept. 29, 1938),
and to give the unveiling address (Apr. 10,1929).
Dr. George Gray Ward sent information about Dr.
Sims to Rice to use in the address. W.L. King,
Jr. asks present name and location of a fort
known as Camp Clambank during the Civil War

 

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 63

 

(June 10, 1929); John K. Aull (Apr. 1930) wants
confirmation of his opinion that Francis W.
Pickens was dominated by his wife, Lucy Holcomb
Pickens; Frank Wilson in September discusses
cures for pellagra with Rice; Lewis E. Staley
notes Rice's observation on Pine Berk Beetles
and asks for more information; in Feb. 1933, J.

Wilson Gibbes asks for a couple of paragraphs
on South Carolinians to go in the Legislative
Manual he is editing; in Aug. 1933, Thomas Dray-
ton Parker requests information on Gen. Samuel
McGowan; in 1934 W.S. Utay, editor of Who's Who-

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 64

 

In South Carolina, asks for and receives sugges-
tions of people to include in the book; and nu-
merous requests come from school girls and boys
for help in papers they were writing. Rice gra-
ciously answered all requests so far as he was
able, his historical information usually being
romantic and patriotic (Sept. 32, 1927 to Ruther

 

ford), and his information on current political
problems reflected his own bitterness, e.g. Dec.
16, 1930. He tells how little development there
has been in Colleton County, and his letter of
June 9, 1931 to Alfred Williams, Jr., discussing

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr.

 

Gullah Negroes and local bushmen, is uncomple-
mentary, as is his sketch of Coleman Livingston
Blease sent to Harry Dillon (Sept. 1932). Sev-
eral Gullah superstitions are told to Helen
Lipscomb in a letter of Mar. 1934,

The history of the Presbyterian church in
S.C. interperses his letters with Dudley Jones

(Feb. 1926); Hagop Bogigian (Apr. 1, 1928), to
whom he also sends his unfavorable opinion on
the current Ku Klux Klan; Archibald Rutledge in
a letter (Oct. 9, 1928) which mentions the sale
of principles by Trinity College when it accept-

ed Duke's money as well as the stand of the
Southern Presbyterian church on Prohibition;
Webber D. Mott regarding a history of the Preby-
terian Church of Walterboro (Nov. 1928); E.C.
McCants (Apr. 1930) in a letter discussing An-
drew Pickens; C.L. Shelby, who in 1935 writes
that he no longer gets a salary- just the Sunday
offering; and in Sept. 1927 B.L..Parkinson wrote
of the weak financial condition of Presbyterian
College. Porter Academy is also in a desperate
financial plight (May 31, 1927).

Elliott family history appears often in

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 67

 

correspondence (May 18, 1926, Apr. 30, May 14,
1931), as does the Stuart family (May 4, July
18, Nov. 14, 1927); the Clarkson family (Feb. 2,
1929), the Rice family(Mar. 1930), and the Smith
family (Aug. 29, 1930). The late Colonel John
J. Dargan is discussed by Virginia White (Dec.
6, 1926), and Robert W. Lide (Jan. 1927). In
July of 1927, Mrs. White praises Richard H. An-
derson, who served in the Confederate Army, and
also discusses Wade Hampton. Rice tells an anec
dote about Gen. Anderson (Mar. 26,.1929).

Rice sends information on Beaufort County

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr. 68
to Lillie Johnson (June 25, 1927), and an abridg
ed version of "Lima and Cuzco" to Sophia Brunson
(June 11, 1929). Duncan Clinch Heyward is de-
famed by Rice, June 30, 1929; Secretary of Ag-
riculture Hyde praised by W.J. Spillman (Sept.
2, 1929); Tillman damned by Eugene Blake in Feb.
1930; James F. Byrnes commended (Sept. 10, 1930);
and Archibald Rutledge appraised (Apr. 9, 1932).

commends the fine work of David Bancroft Johnson

(Jan. 6, 1929).

Chess’ and winning of the State Chess Champ-
ionship by Rice in June 1927 occupies many of
his letters around that time.

In the spring of 1928 there is correspon-

South Carolina National Bank and word from Geo,
R. Koester about a bank failure in St. George.
in November there is general correspondence con
cerned with tne meeting in Charleston of tne
American Ornithologists Union. The Bank of
Charleston and the fate of antebellum State

 

Bank bills are discussed (Dec. 12, 1928, Mar.
20, 1929). The failure of The People's Bank in
Charleston is the subject of a letter Jan. 6,
1952; the stock market crash appears (Nov. 29,

1929); and tne financial and political aspects

 
Rice, James Henry, Jr,

 

of the Veterans Bonus and Bonus Army are debated
by Harry F. Dillon and Alfred B. Williams, Jr.
in 1932. From 1930 on the letters show the
Nationwide effect of the depression. Rice is
confined after 1928 to Brick House Plantation
by the illness of his wife and otner family
responsibilities. His married children are out

in tne world barely supporting their own fami-
lies. Some of his most charming and revealing
letters are written during this time to his

grandchildren, and among the most appreciated
are his ever-more-numerous condolences on tne

death of friends all

Over the State. At the same time he continues
his conservation campaign and his correspondence
with other notables: the Viscount Knutsford
sends a plea for the London Hospital (Aug. 10,
1928); letters to Ridgway give the cause of ma-
laria as being lack of fruit, and describes the
hurricane of 1928. Ridgway replies with infor=
mation on things grown in Richland County, I1lli-
nois; Clive E. Lord, Director of the Tasmanian
Museum and Art Gallery, answers Rice's queries
on flora and fauna (Jan. 33, 1930), and sends

18, 1931). A.B. Williams, Jr. describes the
natural history of Madagascar (June 1931). Harry
F. Dillon tells of his three years in Chile with
the Guggenheim Copper Mine (Feb. 22, 1932). J.
Leighton Stuart sends his impressions of the

daughter's experience covering the Cuban politi-
cal upheaval and relates that William Carrigan,
Duke graduate and promising young sculptor whom
Gutzon Borglum took into his studio, is staying
with her. F.D.R.'s policies are debated in var-
ious letters of the period, and Wilbur Mattoon
mentions visiting C.C.C. camps. Richard E.

Gutsladt writes (Dec. 13, 1933), urging suppres-
sion of an anti-Semitic book; Mrs. Williams
comments favorably on Eleanor Roosevelt (Mar. 7
and 24, 1934), and mentions the overcrowding

of Statuary Hall. M.B. Alexander sends data on

1868-1888, as a Liberal. A principal interest
of his life was the advocacy of arbitration as
a means of settling international disputes.

Richardson, James Burchell. Papers. Clarendon
County, S.C,

This collection contains the family letters
and business papers of James Burchell Richardson
of Sumter District (later Clarendon Co.), S.C.
and his descendants. As the appended chart in-
dicates, James was the son, by a second marriage,
of General Richard Richardson, the S.C. patriot.
James was governor of the state, 1802-1804; four
other members of the family also held that of-
fice (see chart). The collection does not begin
however, until 1822, with the correspondence be-
tween James and his son William Henry Burchell

 

 
RICHARDSON, James Burchell. Sketch. (2)
Richardson, who was attending school, first at a
Mr. Furman's at Woodville, then at Charleston
and Columbia. On James' death (1836) William be
came head of the family, to be succeeded in turr
in 1879 by his eon, James Burchell Richardson.
In the antebellum period the Richardsons were
wealthy cotton planters, owning numerous slaves
and several plantations, largely in Sumter Dis-
trict; their estates included, among others,
Birch Hill, Hyde Park, Sand Hills, Rock Hill,and
Shelburne plantations. They sent their products
to Charleston by boat, and the letters from thei
Charleston factors - eo” John Kirkpatric

 

k

 
and Co. - provide a survey of the cotton market
and an indication of price fluctuations in other
commodities throughout the 19th century. The
Richardsons also bred and raced horses; they own
ed several famous studs and their entries fre-
quently took purses at the Charleston races.
W.H.B.Richardson, who married cousin, Dorothe

Ann Richardson in 1829, followed his father's ex
ample in engaging in public affairs, though with
less success. He became a captain of the mili-~
tia, and was a candidate for the state legisla-

ture in 1844. About 1853 he was appointed Com-
missioner of Public eo” a position

which he held throughout the War. The papers
contain various documents relating to the allot-
ment of slave labor for road construction, both
before and during the war, and to the conscrip-
tion of slaves for work on fortifications during
the war years. In the 1850's W.H.B. also hired
out his hands to a railroad company which was

 

laying a track through the District. ;
The family as a whole, and W.H.B. in particu-
lar, were hot-tempered, involving themselves
freely in litigation, political wrangles, and
personal disputes. The collection contains cop-

les of all letters ex

RICHARDSON, James Burchell. Sketch. (5)
Despite their interest in public affairs,and
their quarrelsome natures, the Richardsons mani-
fested little awareness, as far as may be known
from their letters, of the impending national
crisis. Not until 1861 do we receive any inti-
mation of difficulties between North and South;
in that year two of the sons of W.H.B. enlisted

 

with the army. James B. and Richard saw active
service throughout the war, but their letters
give little indication of the progress of mili-
tary affairs. The papers for the war period do
throw some light, however, on social and econom-
ic conditions on “opr at that
time,

 
RICHARDSON? James Burchell. Sketch. (6)
Reconstruction plunged the family into a stat
of utter destitution. W.H.B. who had been ill
since ca. 1875, was incapable of coping with the
situation and grew steadily more feeble and in-
adequate. The bills for the twenty years preced:
ing his death (1879) record the purchase of vast
amounts of drugs - opium, morphine, laudanum -
which he, and his wife as well, required for the
alleviation of pain. In 1866 W.H.B. gave a pow-
er of attorney to his son, James B.p in 1868 he
sold some of his land to secure cash, hiring out
the larger part of the remainder to tenant far-
mers, mainly —— 1879 he died, a

hopeless and broken man; his wife who survived
him until 1894, continued to rent out sections
of the land. The papers for each year include
contracts between Mrs. Richardson or one of her
sons, and various farmers; the rent stipulated
is usually in the form of money, the landowner
taking a lien on the crop to guarantee payment.

 

The picture of depression, poverty, and hope-
less struggle presented by these letters covers
the years from 1866 to 1910, with almost no evi-
dence of improvement. James B.,who married in
1863, had to support. an increasing family; he
raised cotton, taught o"”” and made

 
RICHARDSON, James Burchell. Sketch. (8)

 

constant efforts to obtain a more remunerative
position. His three brothers, Richard (4.1883),
Francis (4.1896), and Augustus F. (d.1903) strug
gled along on the land, sending their cotton
down to Charleston, according to earlier custom.
Of the sisters, Elizabeth had married in 1848 a
John R. Spann, with whom she went to Ala. In.

1880, after W.H.B.'s death, Mrs. Richardson went
to Ala. on a visit to "BEtt"; in 1883 "Bett"died
leaving five sons and a daughter. Another sis=
ter, Dorothy, never married, but stayed with her
mother; the two died within a year of each other
Dorothy in 1893 and ri mother in 1894,

 
RICHARDSON, James Burchell. Sketch, (9)
Still another sister, Juliana, married her cous-
in, John Peter Richardson, seemingly without pa-
rental approval. He became successful, was ap-
pointed State-Treasurer of S.C., and was gover-
nor of the state, 1886-1890. The letters of Ju-
liana to her brother, James B.,are spirited and
expressive; they cover the years from 1800 to ca
1896, and afford vivid accounts of such events
as the panic of 1884, the earthquake of 1886, the
publication of Ben Hur, the inagurations of her
husband, and the various social gatherings in
the capital. Juliana and James EB. died ca.1910.
It Ps worthy of , that throughout

 

 
RICHARDSON, James Burchell. Sketch. 1
these papers the family express a great interest
in education. The letters of James B.,lst,to
his son, W.H.B.,stress the value of study and
learning in the career of a gentleman. W.H.B.in
turn, sent his daughters to finishing schools in
Charleston, and his elder sons, James B. and
Richard, to Mount Zion Collegiate Institute, ¥
Winnsboro, S.C. James also studied at Charles-
ton, perhaps taking work in the field of medi-
cine. And even in the years of poverty, "Bett"
in Ala. made an effort to send her son,James, to
Columbia College, and James B. Tried to secure
educational in a his children.

This collection is of value because of the
light it throws on the situation of the planta-
tion owner, before, during, and after the Civil

War. Particularly significent are the papers
relating to the system of tenant-farming in the
postbellum period. The papers would also be of
great service in a study of road and railroad
construction in South Carolina.

Letters and Papers, 1840-41879. Sketch.

Richard Riddick was engaged in the shingle and
lumber trade, as agent for the Albemarle Swamp
Lard Company, from ca. 1840 until his death in
1870, when he was succeeded in the office by his
brother, Nathanieli The company seems to have
been chiefly controlled by the Riddicks, and one

 

 

William 8. Whitehead; it was incorporated in 1867
The major part of the collection deals with com-
pany affairs - land squabbles, the building of a
railroad (1871), the cutting, shipping, and sale

of timber- It contains, therefore, much valuable
mater al on the lumber trade in North Carolina.

 
Riddick, Richard H. Beaufort County, N. C.

The papers contain also an account of a run-
away slave who, in 1851, escaped to Boston,
Mass., and remained there, despite Riddick's
efforts to retrieve him. The case, while not
a notorious one, affords an interesting illus-

tration of Northern resistance to the Fugitive
Slave Law.

Robert Ridgway (1850-1929) was the leading
American ornithologist of his time. He was
Curator of Birds at the United States National
Museum from 1880 until his death in 1929. His
publications are numerous.

Ridgway's The Birds of North and Middle
America is a classic work in systematic orni-
thology. His letter of April 10, 1913, relates
to the preparation of Part VI, the volume

 

 
Ridgway, Robert i 2
published in 1914, He is busy with the section
on owls and expects that the parrots will have
to be put in Part VII. The parrots were put
in the seventh volume.

The letter is addressed to Henry Thurston
whom Ridgway thanks for a list of specimens
of glaucidium sent him for examination,
Thurston also called his attention to a specimen
of conuropsis carolinensis, the now extinct
Carolina Parakeet. Thurston contributed several
notes about birds on Long Island to The Auk, A

 

 

 
Ridgway, Robert s
Quarterly Journal of Ornithology, from 1911 to
1914,

The letter is addressed to Thurston in the
care of Dr. Jonathan Dwight, Jr., a physician
of New York City. Dwight's name is included in
the preface to Part VI where Ridgway acknowl-
edges the lending of specimens for its prepas
ration.

When this collection starts, Riggs is in
Co. K., Sth Ohio Vol. Infantry. He transferred
later to the 4th Ohio Vol. Cavalry, 2nd Brig.,
2nd Div., Dept. of the Cumberland. He was a
sergeant tiajor in this unit,

All but two of the letters are love let-
ters from him to Miss Celina Dobbins of Dayton,
Ohio. According to him, she did not wish to
read about the unpleasant aspects 6f war, and
he said he was more inclined to write about

the war. in July, 1560, he was with the onrer®

of Cavalry, Dept. of the Cumberland, at Win-
chester, Tenn. On Aug. 28 he was at Stevenson,
Ala.; on Jan. 19, 1864, near Columbia, Tenn.;
went by way of Gravelly Springs, Ala., to
Cleveland, Tenn.; and on July 6 he was in the

outskirts of Chattanooga. After that he re-
ceived a furlough home to Carthage. By Oct. 30
he was again with his company, which was at
Rome, Ga., and by Nov. 20 he was at Camp Webster
near Nashville, Tenn. At this time he does
mention the mud, a i of camp life, and

 
Riggs, Philip D. 3
the thousands of rats which infested the camp.
The inmates of the Ohio penitentiary, he said,
were more comfortable than any soldiers in his
camp. On Dec. 2 he speaks of their working on
fortifications and the citizens of all classes
in Nashville digging rifle pits. On Feb. 22,

 

1865 he is back at Gravelly Springs, Ala., on
his way to Macon, Ga. On May 2 he wrote from
the latter place, telling of the loss suffered
by his regiment at She Battle of Selma, Ala.,
which was captured on Apr. 2, and of his en-
counter with a dying Confederate soldier during

 
Riggs, Philip D. 4
the battle. By July 9 he had been mustered out

of the army and was at home. From a letter of
Dec. 8, 1865 it looks as if he was planning to
marry Miss Dobbins during that month.

The only two letters in the collection that
are not from Riggs are: one addressed to Celina

 

by a Missouri cousin on May 31, 1864, and one
written to Riggs on Sept. 6, 1870 by his cousin,
The Rev. L. R. Jayne. Both of the letters con-
tain genealogy of the Dobbins and Riggs fami-
lies. Reference is made in the latter letter
to Riggs' wife andschildren.

 
Riggs, Philip D. 5

In the letter of Sept. 6, 1870, Ada Dobbins
of Philadelphia, Marion Co., Mo., speaks, in
addition to other members of her family, of a
brother who joined the Confederate Army and died
of disease and exposure in Ark. She tells of
living in southwestern Mo. earlier in the war
and of how the people there suffered because
both armies overran it.

The Riggs Family Papers center in the circle
of George Washington Riggs (1813-1881), the
founder of Riggs and Company, later the Riggs
National Bank, Washington, D.C. These papers
were taken from the I Street mansion of the
Riggs family by Mary McMullen, who was the com-

panion of Miss Jane Riggs (1853-1930). Miss
McMullen inherited certain furnishings in the
Riggs house under Miss Jane's will. The Riggs

manuscripts were removed with this legacy, and
this is their only connection with the McMullen

 
 

Riggs Family - 2
family, who sold the papers to the Perkins
Library in 1966. In the McMullen Family Papers
are details of the unsuccessful fight that
Elisha Riggs waged to retain family heiriooms.
George Washington Riggs and his partner,
William W. Corcoran, were collectors of art
objects, currency, and paintings. A few early

letters pertain to this collecting interest.
Peter Force secured fractional currency of the
Revolutionary War period for Mr. Riggs. A let-

ter by Charles Loring Elliott noted the sale of
the picture, "The Song of the Shirt," which had

 
 

Riggs Family 3
een painted by Rembrandt Peale. W.L. Nicholson

described in 1880 the work of his father, the
Scottish etcher and portrait painter William
Nicholson (1781-1844).

Lawrason Riggs (1814-1888) became executor
of the estate of G.W. Riggs, his brother, who
died in 1881. As the latter had heavy invest-

ments in Washington real estate, transactions
in regard to property are revealed both in the
correspondence and in the legal and financial
papers.

Miss Alice Riggs received in 1892 a rare

 
Riggs Family 4
specimen of fractional money printed as an ex=
periment on allegedly indestructible paper in
1868. George Harrington, who was Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury at that time, gave her
the currency.

Investments are the concern of a number of
letters as both Miss Jane and Miss Alice Riggs

 

had their considerable fortunes in many differ--
ent companies.
Miss Alice Riggs, as guardian of George and

Antoine de yg (gl young nephews, was much
s s n

ettl

involved in the 1 g their share of

 
 

Riggs Family 7
their deceased mother’s estate, as Katherine
Shedden (Riggs) de Geofroy had died in 1881,
the same year as her father.

In 1898, Elisha Francis Riggs began acting
as business agent for Miss Jane Riggs. Involved
in family affairs were also the Howards, the
children of Cecilia (Riggs) and Henry Howard.

Of this group George Howard had some business
connection with Miss Jane, but soon relinquished
this. Later letters of the Howards indicate ~

that they were not on friendly terms with Miss
Jane. :

 
Riggs Family 6
Miss Riggs was stranded in Germany at the
outbreak of World War I and succeeded finally
in reaching the Netherlands. Marshall Langhorne
writes to her after her return to the United
States.
The legal papers relate to the settlement of
large estates of considerable value:

 

1. Estate of Elisha Riggs (1779-1853).
. 5 Will of George Washington Riggs (1813-
881). .

3. Division of the estate of G.W. Riggs.

A few bills of exchange belong to the commercial
transactions of George Peabody and his partner,

 

Elisha Riggs (1799-1853).

Among the printed materials are pamphlets on
the suit of Elisha Francis Riggs (d. 1936)
against Mary McMullen for possession of family

treasures.

Rigsbee, Atlas M. Account Books, 1859-1905.
Durham, Durham County, North Carolina

Atlas M. Rigsbee (1341-1903), mercantile
dealer and property owner, was one of Durham's.
wealthiest citizens at the time of his death on
November 29, 1903. Biographical information
comes from his obituary in the Durham Daily Sun,
November 30, 1903, p. 1. He was born June 27,

 

 

1841, at the Rigsbee home place about two miles
southwest of downtown Durham. During the great-
er part of his life he operated a mercantile
business in the city. He also owned a consider-

 
Rigsbee, Atlas M, 2
able amount of property and was reputed to be
perhaps the largest real estate owner in the
city. His will, probated in December, 1903, is
on file at the courthouse.

The Rigsbee family home was just north of
their cemetery that is on.the east side of Duke
Stadium. Rigsbee's first home in the city was
on the site of the present Post Office. He was
on the first Board of Aldermen. This informa-
tion is from Mr. Egbert Haywood, a Durham lawyer
and grandson of Atlas Rigsbee.

 

 
Rigsbee, Atlas M. 2a

 

The account books comprise a continuous
record of his mercantile store for over: fort
years. They include the ledgers (1859-1900),
the cash books (1878-1902), the daybooks (1888-
1902), and a purchase and accounts payable book
(1874-1878). Rigsbee handled groceries, hard-
ware, dry goods, etc. in his general store, and

 
Rigsbee, Atlas M. 3
during the 1560's and early 1870's he also sold
alcoholic beverages. The store was on the
northeast corner of Main and Mangum streets in
1884.

By 1891 the real estate operations were suf-
ficient to warrant separate account books, the
Rent Ledgers, 1891-1905.

 

During 1874-1878 purchases and accounts pay-
able for purchases of goods for the store were
kept in a separate book, the Purchase Book and
Accounts Payable Ledger. These accounts were

 
Rigsbee, Atlas M. 4
later continued in the main ledgers.

There is a Farm Ledger, 1867-1873, that was
also continued in the main ledgers in which some
of the first entries refer to the old volume as
the "Farm Book."

The ownership and title of the business ap-
parently changed several times, but A.M. Rigs-
bee's name is always associated with it. A new
series of ledgers was begun with "Ledger A" in
1878, and entries in it refer to the previous
series as"A. M. Rigsbee." Entries in the last

 

 
Rigsbee, Atlas M. 5
accounts of the first series are continued in
the ledgers of "A. M. Rigsbee and Co." that is
apparently a new title for the firm. How long
this second title was continued is uncertain.
The business continued at the same address as
Robert H. Rigsbee, general merchandise, accord-
ing to the city directory for 1905-1906. Soon
he entered the fertilizer business that was con-
tinued as A.M. Rigsbee's Sons.

The ledgers have three series, each one begin
ning with a™Ledger A" and continuing in alpha-

 

 
Rigsbee, Atlas M. 6
betical order. The first series ends in 1878.

However, the dating in the earlier ledgers
overlaps; accounts were not carried to new
ledgers until space ran out in the old ones, and
some accounts had to be transferred sooner than
others. The third series of ledgers begins in
1892 when Rigsbee changed his accounting system

 

from single to double entry; a statement of
this change appears at the beginning of Journal

A (1892-1894).
The following printed volume came with the

Jacob August Riis (1849-1914), reformer,
author, and journalist, was a native of Ribe,
Denmark. Arriving in New York in 1870, he
eventually became a police reporter for the
New York Sun. This job introduced him to the

 

crime and misery in the slums of New York City.
As a result, he became a leader in-the move-
ment for school and tenement house reform and

 
Riis, Jacob August 2

 

in the push for small parks and playgrounds in
the city. Riis's major vehicle for reform was
the writing of articles and books which
described the evils he wished to destroy.
Examples of such works are the books, How the
Other Half Lives and The Children of the Poor.
He also served as secretary of the New York

 

 

Small Parks Commission. Riis was married
twice, first to Elizabeth D, Nielsen and then
to Mary Phillips after the death of his first

wife,

 
Riis, Jacob August nasil 3
The items in the collection fall in the
years after 1899, when Riis supported himself

by lectures and the writing of articles and
books. Most of the letters were written by
him to Edward William Bok, editor in chief of
The Ladies’ Home Journal. The correspondence,

 

 

1-1908, primarily concerns articles Riis
was writing. In connection with discussing the
articles, he revealed his close relationship to
President Theodore Roosevelt. Riis wrote of
his love for Roosevelt, and in a letter of

 
Riis, Jacob August 4
March I1, 1902, noted that he was “very fond

of the family in the White House," In 1903

and 1904, he composed a series of articles for
Out Look magazine ent fitted, "Theodore Roosevelt
the Citizen," which later became a book. He
wrote in September, 1903, "It is one of my
chapters, for I am writing, not a life, but the
man, friend, husband, father." Another re-
vealing passage on April 16, 1904, is "

there are few things in my life that have given
me so much genuine happiness as to be able to

 

 
Riis, Jacob August >

 

write about him [Roosevelt] . . . what was in
my heart concerning him."

In other letters to Bok, Riis spoke of his
poor health and of the many lectures he was
giving. The photographer Frances Benjamin
Johnson was called "a most capable artist" by
Riis in a letter of May 19, 1902. After his

wife's death in 1905, he wrote on July 23 that
he was going to attach his wife's name to one

of the
ment.

Riis, Jacob August 6

 

There are six letters that Riis wrote to
William V. Alexander, the managing editor of
The Ladies' Home Journal. They deal with
Riis’s articles and overwork on his lecture
tours,

The third correspondent is Major James
Burton Pond, a lecture manager. Indications

 

are that Riis did not have a very cordial
relationship to Pond. Riis wrote to him of
the problems with Pond's lecture bureau and of
the fact that he was using The Redpath Lyceum

 
Riis; Jacob August E 7
Bureau. In a letter of December 5, 1901, to
Pond, Mrs. Riis reminded him of his comment
that Riis's lecture would not be popular
because people prefer to be amused rather than
to hear of misery. On June 11, 1902, Riis
wrote that he had made $600 a week on a lecture
tour.

 

Included also are photographs of Riis which
were clipped from magazines, and two magazine
clippings which give biographical information
and comment on him. One of the articles was

Mary (Roberts) Rinehart (d. 1958) wrote
numerous novels and plays. In an undated
letter to a Mr. Kennedy, who evidently was a
Canadian, she explained that poor health had

forced her to decline all invitations to speak
in public. Noting that she had to conserve
her energy, she stated that she preferred to
concentrate on her writing rather than divide
her limited working time between writing and

public engagements.

Carolina, had been active in the S. C. State
Militia. General Ripley commanded the 2nd Mili-
tary District of South Carolina in Jan., 1862,

when the British Consul at Charleston, Robert

Col. Valentine Ripley was a leading citizen
of Hendersonville, N.C. Information about him
may be found in: Sadie Smathers Patton, The
Story of Henderson County (Asheville, N.c.,

 

1947); and Lenoir Ray, Postmarks, A History of
Henderson County, North Carolina, 1787-1968
(Chicago, 1970)

Hendersonville was situated on the most
direct route between Asheville, N.C., and

 

 
Ripley, Valentine

 

Greenville, S.C. Beginning sometime in the
1840's, Ripley was owner, or part-owner, of a
major stagecoach line that connected Greeneville,
Tennessee, with Greenville,S.C., and points
southward. This route ran through Asheville,
Hendersonville, and Flat Rock. John T. Pool (or
Poole) of Greenville, S.C., was one of the
partners,

The Receipt Book, 1859-1864, belonged to the
stage line of Rutledge, Pool, & Ripley. In 1863
the name of the firm changed to Ripley & Pool.

Letters and papers of the William Young

their state's role in the Civil Wer. The
collection centers mainly around William Young
Ripley; his sons, William Y. W. , Edward
Hastings, and Charles; his daughters, Mary R.
Fisher and Julia C. R. Dorr; his grandson,
Thomas Emerson Ripley; and his great nephew,

cerned with four subjects: the Civil War; life
in the western part of the United States,
1866-67; life among the upver classes of
European society, 1864-73; and the Spanish-
American War. Photographs @f the Ripley home

 

and family are filed separately.

The bulk of the correspondence relating
to the Civil War, which numbers approximately
one hundred items, was carried on by William

Young Ripley, his wife, and their two sons,

Their letters are not so numerous 28s those
written by their sons, but they do provide a

 

clear picture of whet was done in Centre Rut-
land to support the war effort. William Y. W.
Rioley held the rank of Gaptain in the First
Vermont Regiment when the war broke out. He
traveled with the regiment to Fort Monroe in
Virginia in 1861. Late that year, on November

Hastings Rivley was a student at Union College
in 1861. The next year he was given a com-
mission to recruit a company of men at Centre
Rutland for the Ninth Vermont Infantry and
embarked on a military career which was to con-
tinue for the remainder of the war. Only his
letters for the years 1859-63 are preserved

 

here. They reveal something of the impact of
the war on college life and of the problems in
recruiting troops. The few letters from the

war zone in Virginia are routine.
A year after the Civil War ended Charles

 
Ripley, William Young. Sketch. 6
Ripley undertook an overland trip to California
He traveled by rsilroad to St. Louis, by boat
part of the way up the Missouri River, by
stagecoach on to Virginiax City, Montana, and
by horseback and boat the remaining dis te nce.
The collection contains only eleven letters

 

concerning the trip, but these give a vivid
description of travel conditions, Fenian Raids
at Buffalo, New York; and life in western
mining towns.

There are approximately one hundred let-
ters from Mary R. and Cyrus M. Fisher, who

 
Rioley, William Young. Sketch. %
lived in London from 1864-73. Cyrus was en-
gaged in the practice of law. He and his wife
associated with titled Englishmen and members
of the diplomatic colony. A few of their let-
ters give excellent accounts of life’in London
and in other European cities to which they

 

traveled. The bulk of the letters, however,
are concerned with details of Mary's recurrent
illnesses. In 1873 both Cyrus and Mary were
drowned when the Atlantic sank off the coast
of Newfoundland. During the months following
this event, William YM. Ripley corresponded

 
Ripley, William Young. Sketch. 8
with several persons in an effort to settle
his late brother-in-law's effairs.

A small group of letters relates to the
Spanish-American War. There are letters from
Thomas Emerson Ripley to his father telling
of his effort to obtain active military ser-

 

vice and commenting on war news, Harry R. Dodd
wrote William Y. W. Ripley several letters
about life in a military camp in Georgia and
his attempt to secure an officer's commission.
There wre also a few letters from a soldier in

Puerto Rico, which ‘eo the fighting there.

Risley, Hanson A. Papers, Fredonia,
Chautaugua Co., New York

 

Hanson A. Risley was the son of Elijah
Risley, member of Congress from New York, 1849=
1851. He held several minor official positions
and was acquainted with William Henry Seward.
The item comprising this collection is a memoir

by Risley about his relationship with Seward.

Risley first met Seward during the latter's
service as an agent in western New York for tne
Holland Land Company. Seward was commissioned
by the company to settle the grievances the

 
Risley, Hanson A.
Settlers expressed against company policy.

Of particular interest are the comments
Seward made about Horace Greeley. He recog-
nized Greeley's impulsiveness, but praised him
nevertheless for his political acumen and
journalistic success. Greeley's attempt to
become President of the New York Senate was

 

blocked by Seward, who supported Henry Jarvis
Raymond, editor of Greeley's rival newspaper,
the New York Times. The two men, however ,

remained friendly and mutually respectful of

each other's ability.

 

 
Risley, Hanson A. ; 3
Risley visited Seward in Washington soon
after Seward was elected Senator from New York.

He became involved in the struggle for
patronage control between the rival factions of
New York politicians in Washington. Thurlow
Weed is mentioned frequently.

136 items and 1 vol. added, 10-30-68:

 

Papers written by, addressed to, or collected
by various members of Risley's family. The

principal figures are Risley and his daughter
Olive F. Risley. Many of the items are dated

 
Risley, Hanson A. 4
during his connection with the Treasury Department. After
Grant became President, Risley moved to Colorado. He died
in 1893. Olive F. Risley remained in Washington and was
adopted by William Henry Seward. She took his name and
became Olive Risley Seward. The papers after the Civil War

 

are largely hers. Biographical information on the Risleys is
included in History of Chautauqua County, New York...by
Andrew W. Young. Olive Risley Seward apparently wrote the

 
Risley, Hanson A,

major portion of Seward's Travels Around the
World, a travel journal kept during her trip
with Seward in 1870 and 1871.

These additional papers are for the most
part letters written by the prominent persons
with whom the Risley family became associated
through their friendship with the Sewards,
through participation in the affairs of the
Republican Party in New York, or during the
family's residence in Washington. Some of the
items were acquired by a member of the family

 

 

 
Risley, Hanson A, 6
who collected autographs. The papers were
mounted in two scrapbooks, but for the sake of
preservation, one of these volumes was disman-
tled when catalogued and the other retained only
because its contents could not be easily de-
tached,

Among the more noteworthy items are the let-

 

ters from Horace Greeley, Thurlow Weed, William
Henry Seward, Henry Clay, Charlotte Saunders
Cushman, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Bret Harte,

Daniel Webster, Richard Wagner, the Spanish,

 
Risley, Hanson A,

 

Japanese, and French ministers to the U. S.
(Facundo Goni, Arinori Jugoi Mori, and Comte
Charles de Chambrun respectively), a legal
brief by Millard Fillmore, and a letter from
Aleksandr Georgiyevich Vlangaly, the Russian
minister to China in 1870.

With the exception of a few letters, the

correspondence is generally personal. There
are numerous letters of introduction and refe-
rences to family matters... The Republican Party,
national politics, William Henry Seward, and

 
Risley, Hanson A,
Abraham Lincoln are among the subjects given
more than random comment.

There are two letters from The. Ritsmiller
to his wife while he was on military duty in
Missouri in August and September, 1862. His
home county is identified through his reference
on Sept. 18 to the presentation by "old Mr.
Isaac Funk" of two flags, gifts of the "McLean
Co. folks," to the regiment. Isaac Funk (1797-
1865) was one of the most prominent citizens of
McLean County, Illinois; see Portrait and

(Chicage, 1857), pp. LI48-T149.

Ritsmiller's first letter (Aug. 31, 1862,
first 4 pp. only) is a description of the camp
life and training routine at Benton Barracks,
St. Louis.

On Sept. 18 he discussed the march through
southern Missouri. The regiment was then camped

 

near Mansfield [?]. He asked that mail be sent
to Rolla, a base north of Mansfield.

Ritsmiller was probably a member of the 94th
Regiment of Illinois infantry. This regiment

 
Ritsmiller, The.

included many men from McLean County, left
Bloomington for St. Louis (Benton Barracks) on
Aug. 25, and moved to Rolla, Missouri, by the
second week of September. See Jacob L. Hasbrovw

with General Meigsand Franklin he was em-
ployed as engineer on the capitol and post-
office buildings and he was detailed to make
an investigation and report on the best
location for a bridge across the Potomac

at Washington. “e next served as divisional

 

engineer of the Washington aqueduct and pre-
paredplans and estimates for the Cabin John

@ ravin® "ear the Potomac several miles above

 
RIVES, Alfred Landon Sketch(4)

 

Washington,is a eingle masonry arch of 221
feet nearly 100 feet high and at the time
it was built was the ldngest stone arch in
the world. Onthe outbreak of the Civil War
Rives resigned his position as engineer in
the U.S. army and was appointed captain of

the Virginia engineers. He constructed a
series of defense works between the York
and James rivers,near Williamsburg, Va.,and
acting chief of the engineer bureau of the

Confederated States until the close of the

 
RIVES, Alfred Landon Sketch(5)

war. He was closely associated with J.F.Gil-
mer. Thereafter he conducted a private prac-
tice as an engineer and architect in Rich-
mond,Va.,designing and erecting buildings
and constructing a coal railroad. He was
division engineer in charge of the construc-

 

tion of the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad .
across the Alleghany mountains, 1867-1870,

ganeral manager and vice-president,he built

a branch line from Columbus,Ky.,to Cairo,Ill.

Rives married on Feb.1,1859 Sarah Cathe-
rine,daughter of James Brown Macmurdo of
Richmond,and had three daughters: Amelia

 

Rives Troubetskoy,the author; Gertrude, the

wife of Allen Potts,editor of the Richmond

New Leader; Sarah Landon Rives, an artist.
e letters of this collection are

exceptionally interesting. There are few in

 
RIVES, Alfred Landon Sketch(8)

the 1840's of William C.Rives,containing
Casual remarks on politics. While a student
in Paris,Alfred Landon Rives formed a close
friendship with Edouard Schwebeli, librarian
at Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees,who proveé
a faithful correspondent for a number of

 

years. The majority of the letters are those
of Judith Page Rives to Alfred. However
there we a number from Francis R., Wm.C.,dr.,
and evidently too busy to write often,for

there were numerous complaints against his

 
RIVES, Alfred ~gndon Sketch(9)

silence. This” portion of the letters reveals
a great deal on social,economic,and potiti-
Cal affairs in general and especially on
the family life of the Rives.
William Cabell Rives,Sr. was a commissio-~
ner to the peace Congress,which met in Washing-~

 

ton,Feb.4,1861. The ultimate failure of the
movement was predicted in a letter of Mre.

New York and those at Castle Hill were diffi-
cult and in this collection there are only

4 few letters which were sent by underground
routes. Alfred attained the rank of colonel
in the Confederate army and in all there are
about fifty Civil War letters,varying in

 

importance and interest.

The letters after 1865 are less interesting
and contain little information of intrinsic
value. They are from the family and women

friends of Sarah(Macmurdo)Rives in which they

 
RIVES Alfred “andon Sketch(11)

tell of their children,of their household

duties,of the frips to White Sulphur Springs

and matters of a similar mature. There is littl

information about H.L.Rives,although he was

actively engaged in various railroad projects.
The collection is valuable mainly be-

 

Cause it contains the correspondence of a
prominent and influential Virginia family of

wide interest. |
25 items added 3-28-50. Among these are

letters to Wm. C. Riveg which are as: follows:

Rives, Alfred Landon

 

Diary and recollections of Judith Page
(Walker) Rives (Mar. 24, 1802-Jan. 23, 1882),
writer, granddaughter of Thomas Walker of
Castle Hill, Albemarle County, Virginia, and
wife of William Cabell Rives, U.S. “enator
and twice minister to France, first under

Democratic administration (1829-1831), and
last under a Whig administration (1849-53)
including chiefly accounts of European affairg#
and details of their stay in France and

 
Rives, Alfred Landon Ey

 

and travel on the continent. The first por-
tion of the diary is more valuable since it
is a direct record of the first period of
Rives' incumbency as minister to France in
the form of letters from Judith Page (Walker)
Rives to her sister, Jane Francis (Walker)

Page, wife of Dr. Mann Page. The second
part, written in 1871, consists of recollec-
tions chiefly of the second period of Rives!
service &s U.S. minister to France. The

 
Rives, Alfred Landon 18

 

diary is written with great honesty, the
author frankly confessing her inability to
interpret the political changes which she
described or to judge the great works of
art which she saw. She commented freauent-
ly on the shallow standards of refinement,

on the dismal weather, and on her dislike
of the prim gardens and other evidences of
artificiality so objectionable to an Ameri-
can accustoméd to more lordly spaces and

 
Rives, Alfred Landon - 19

 

and more democratic habits.

The first of Mrs. Rives! letters con-
tain accounts of a tour of Western New York
State with mention of the Erie Canal, Roches-
ter, Buffalo, and Niagara Falls; and a trip
to New England. These jaunts were made while
waiting for the vessel to sail for France.
Her graphic account of the océan voyage,
during which time she was subject to a vio-
lent seasickness, is replete with facts

 
Rives, Alfred Landon

 

pointing to the discomforts of ocean voy-
ages at that time.

After her arrival in France she writes
of housekeeping difficulties, household
customs, diplomatic receptions, lack of re-
grad for the Sabbath, a visit to Lafayette

at Lagrange, the Revolution of 1830. She
refers to Washington Irving who was visiting
Paris during the disturbances of 1830, de-
scribes street scenes; Versailles (a detailed

 
Rives, Alfred Landon 21

 

and careful account ‘made in June, 1831),
and gives a detailed account of a summer
tour from Paris to Lake Geneva, Mt. Blanc,
St. Bernard, Berne, Zurich, Baden, Carls-
ruhe, Heidleberg, down the Rhine to Mayence,
Cologne, Nimegen, the Hague, Haarlem, Ant-
werp, and back to Paris with many details
and accounts of side trips. Perhaps most
detailed and significant of her accounts .of
the trip involve the following: repeated

 
Rives, Aifred Landon 22

 

reference to the idiotic appearance of
people generally deformed by goiters in the
vicinity of Geneva, full description of a
house near the foot of Mt. St. Bernard,
disgust at idle priests and Catholic forms,
description of Rousseau's haunts (including

the statement that her mother had not
allowed her to read Rousseau during her
juvenile years), her pleasure at returning
to French soil, disappointment in the Rhine

 
Rives, Alfred Landon 23

 

trip, visits to museums in Holland, clean-
liness of the Dutch, tulip and other bulbs
and great organ of Haarlem, references to
fortifications and soldiers in connection
with the threat of war between Holland and
France (Sept. 14, 1831), ruins in Antwerp

resulting from the revolution of 1830,
short reference to the new'King Leopold"
and Waterloo battlefield.

Back in Paris by Octobenl, 1831, she

 
Rives, Alfred Landon 24

 

writes of the disappearance of former diplo-
mats on account of the change in govern-
ment. In her recollections she refers to
some of her verses which N. P. Willis had
praised (II, p. 3 in recollections); a
dinner with the King of France who fed her

with ham and her husband with cornbread in
memory of the King's stay in Tennessee; an
account of naming her daughter for Amélie

(daughter of the French king and bter queen

 
Rives, Alfred Landon 25

 

of Belgtum ); a graphic account of the
return voyage which occupoed 51 days from
the English channel to New’ foundland (shews
seasick again); Rives' talk with S. F. B.
Morse (then on board) about his theories

of the telegraph; return to New York where

she described envy for European society;
the trip from New York to Virginia; refer-
ence to a visit of Daniel Webster to James
Madison; account of activities while her

 
Rives, Alfred Landon 26

 

husband was U.S. senator; a short sketch of
Jacksonian politics; Jackson's visit to the
Rives at Castle Hill; second trip by steam
to France when Rives again served as U.S.
minister; of her son, Alfred Landon Rives,
and his education at Ecole des Pont et

Chaussées; democratic manner of Napoleon III
soon after heading the French government;
Mr. Rumff (II, 92) who had married a daugh-
ter of Astor, the American millionaire, and

 
Rives, Alfred Landon 27.

 

was minister to France from the Hanseatic
towns; the Spanish ambassador whose father,
the Marauis @'0O had married thé Phila-
delphia beauty, Miss McKean; the Baroness
de Rothschild; a tour through Italy and re-
turn via Marseilles to Paris; a summer at
the seaside resort of Boulogne where the
elegant "Miss Corbin" was also staying; her
son, William Rives, and his summer in Spain;
the gradual assumption of more complete

 
Rives, Alfred Landon 20

 

power by Napoleon III and the final coup
d'etat; James Fenimore Cooper and his anger
at the insulting reception given a auota-
tion made from him by Lafayette in the
Assembly (II, 125-); and numerous details
of the courtship of Napoleon III for Eugénie
de Montijo and the pageantry of their
marriage in Notre Dame Cathedral.

This descrijipive sketch and the two
volumes of Mrs.~Rives were combined with the

Alfred Landon Rives Papers on Sept. 24, 1968.

Petersburg, Va.

Francis &. Rives (1795-1661) was aU. 6.
Representative from Va, (1837-1841), The letters
of Rives as a representative of the Petersburg
R. R. are valuable for an account of early rail-
roading in N, C. and Va. They concern the
fight for the possession of the Weldon bridge
Over the Roanoke River, and seventeen miles of
track belonging to the Portsmouth and Roanoke
R. R., the sale of which to Rives caused the
dissolution of the Portsmouth and Roanoke Rail-
road, See also the papers of George Edmund

Rives was apparently a lawyer and planter.
The letters are chiefly concerned with business
affairs, including court matters, cotton sales,
the purchase of guano, and the settlement of his
mother's estate. The letters give very little
information about the family.

WasHington, D.C.

Jonn Cook Rives was a partner of Francis
Preston Blair, Sr. and served as financial man-
ager of the Washington Daily Globe. When the
partnership was dissolved in 1849, Rives contin-
ued to publish the Congressional Globe, prede-
cessor of the Congressional Record. Many papers
in this collection are addressed to both Blair
and Rives, even after the dissolution of the
newspaper partnership. Since these papers con-
cern financial matters, mostly relating to the

 

 

 

 

 
Rives, John Cook 2
newspapers, tney have been placed with Rives's
papers. See also the Francis Preston Blair, Sr.
papers for further information about Rives.

The Rives collection consists primarily of
letters requesting subscriptions to the Rives-
Blair publications. These letters indicate that
the Daily Globe and Congressional Globe were
circulated throughout the United States.

In a letter of May 16, 1846, terms for the
purchase of an office building are stated. Sev-
eral letters written in 1857 concern a lawsuit

 

 

 

 
Rives, John Cook 3

in which Blair and Rives opposed a Mr. Barton.
Blair and Rives appear to have been represented
by J. Cambreleng, probably the New York attorney
who was the brother of C.C. Cambreleng.

Letters of Sept. 15, 1859, and Dec. 22, 1862,
concern a mortgage held by Rives on the Church
of the Holy Trinity.

1 item added, 1-19-65, is a letter from
James Madison Hite Beale, Sr. to John Cook Rives
in 1857. It is of a social and business nature.

Churchill Caldom Cambreleng on the subtreas-
ury bill in the House of Representatives (Oct-
ober 24, 1837). A note at the bottom of this
letter indicates that John Miller, U. S. Rep-
resentative from Missouri, also ordered copies
of Cambreleng's speech. |

Frederick Sleigh Roberts, First Earl Roberts
(1832-1914), British field marshal, had a dis-
tinguished military career in which his service
in India, Afghanistan, and South Africa was
particularly outstanding.

Three series of Roberts' letters are ad-
dressed to: Charles Frederic Moberly Bell,
manager of The Times, 1901-1910; Richard Bentley

the publisher, 1895-1898; and Charles Rathbone

 
Roberts, Frederick Sleigh, First Earl Roberts 2
Low, the naval and military historian, 1881-1007
Charles Rathbone Low. published a biography

of Roberts in 1883. Roberts' five letters of
1881 to Low concerned a magazine article that
the historian was writing about the General's
military career. On April 7, 1887, Roberts was
in Quetta, India, when he commented on the

 

strengthening of defenses in the frontier re-
gion near Afghanistan. The letter of 1907 has
a reference to the career in India of Low's

father.

 
Roberts, Frederick Sleigh, First Earl Roberts 3
Messrs. Richard Bentley & Son published
Roberts' autobiography, Forty-one Years in Indié
from Subaltern to Commander-in-Chief, in 1897,
and the book went through many editions. Rob-
erts' seventeen letters to Richard Bentley dur-
ing 1895-1898 are mostly about the preparation,
publication, sale, and revision of this book.

 

 

 

Twenty-eight letters, 1901-1910, from Rob-
erts to Charles Frederic Moberly Bell, manager
of The Times,- date mostly during 1901-1905

when the Field Marshal was commander-in-chief.

 
Roberts, Frederick Sleigh, First Earl Roberts 4
The correspondence indicates how sensitive
Roberts was to whatever the newspaper printed
about the army, for some of the matters dis-
cussed were routine complaints that appeared

in letters to the editor. Sir Valentine Chirol
was in charge of the newspaper's foreign depart-
ment, and twice Roberts tried to persuade him

 

of the strategic importance of keeping Seistan,
Persia, out of Russian Control (Sept. 6, 18,
1902). On Jan. 13, 1903, Roberts expected good

results from the Durbar in India, and he dated

 
Roberts, Frederick Sleigh, First Earl Roberts 5
a change in relations with the ruling chiefs
from an assemblage held by Lord Lytton in 1877.

 

out of the press until Parliament met (Feb. 8,
1903). The Field Marshal praised the reporting
upon Eastern affairs by the newspaper's cor-

respondent in India (April 23, 1903).

1 item added, 9-24-75. On Sept. 29, 1874,
Roberts wrote from the Quarter Master General's
office in Simla, India, and explained to Charles
Metcalfe Macgregor why Cecil James East was

 
Roberts, Frederick Sleigh, First Earl Roberts 6
preferred over him for a position in that
office.

religious fanatic, and morphine addict; of his
wife, Mary Catherine (Watlington) Roberts (b.
1837); and of a few of their friends and rela-
tives, Included also are three small account
books containing some records of expense and
lists of individuals of whom Roberts painted por-

traits with the price usually included,
Wm, Anderson Roberts attended an academy in

 

 
ROBERTS -2-

Yanceyville, but, in March, 1856, left the acade=
my to study art under Oliver P. Copeland in Ra-
leigh, N. ©. There are a few family letters to
Roberts while in Raleigh during 1856 containing
frequent mention of attivities of the Methodist
Church in the Yanceyville area. From 185% until
1861 the correspondence consists largely of per=

 

sonal letters fromRoberts' friends in Raleigh.
During this period also there are letters f rom
Roberts' brother, James Li Roberts, and a few

from his father, Elijah Roberts, usually per-
taining to family affairs and such matters as

 
Roberts 3
camp meetings, sermons, and conversions.

Most voluminous perhaps is the correspondence
during the war years. Roberts was conscripted
in July, 1862, to become a member of Co. A, 14
Regiment, N. C. troops. After exhausting every
means at his disposal, claiming to be a sufferer
from consumption and any other disease that
occured to him, Roberts was inducted into the
Confederate Army. His letters are filled with
pleas for a substitute and accounts of "pleading
sick." But his pleas did little good. Roberts

entered the

 

 
ROBERTS -4-

army at Camp Holmes near Raleigh, going from
there to Richmond, Gordonsville, and finally to
the Senseney Hospital in Winchester, Va., al-~
though he was not very 111. Robarts then marched
to Leesburg, Va., but was soon back in Richmond
at Moore Hospital from which he wrote many let-
ters containing ideas for getting out of the

 

Army. In one letter especially, Nov. 16, 1862,
he wrote of his great anvetite and added, " I am
tolerably well at present and I think I will be

entirely well when I get my free papers and
Start home." It was while i nMoore Hospital

 
 

ROBERTS -5— Opium
that he began taking mozmphine,

On December 6, 1862, Roberts was transferred
from Moore Hospital to Chimborazo Hospital which
he described very fully in a letter of December 8,
1862. Within twoo weeks he was transferred to
McKenney's Hospital in Danville, Va., as a nurse,
although he still tried to get a substitute or
a discharge. Early in 186% he became i111 with
smallpéx and was isolated in a smallpox hospital
near Danville. Roberts rejoined his regiment

neaf Bowling Green, Va., by April 9, 1863. Aving
in the open , drilling, andmarching, Roberts’

 
ROBERTS -6-

health inproved andhe was not so frightened, He
was at the Battle of Gettysburg taking part in
the fighting but wounding his left elbow by fall-
ing on it. By August 29, 1863, he was in Railros
Hospital at Dayville having his elbow treated. Be
coming 111 with erysipelas in January, 1864, Rob-
erts was never returned to his regiment but be-
came Ward Master of the 1st Division Generel Hos-
pital at Danville in Feb., 1864, In October he
was promoted becoming Clerk to the Medical Exam-

ining Board of the General Hospital,
As a result of his various confinements ReBse

Roberts' letters reflect unusually well the man-
agement of a Confederate hospital. Among his
papers are rules for a ward master and his lette
tell much. of his duties. He also writes often of
some friend or neighbor who appeared before the
Medical Examining Board hoping tc be excused from
further military duty.

An an artist, Roberts! correspondence is per-
haps most valuable, There are a few letters from
his teacher, Oliver ~ Copeland, over a long pe-

riod of time, but Biving a general account of
Copeland's activities including his work with

 

 
ROBERTS -8~=

Oil portraits and ambrotypes in Raleigh, his tea-
ching at Oxford Female College and his portrait
painting at Oxford during 1857, his work in Ame-
lia County, Va., in 1860 and his work inNorfolk,
Va., in the 1886's, There are also a few let-
ters from Davis S, Forney, an artist of Wyrthe-
ville but who painted. many portraits in the Dan-
ville area, Included in three small notebooks
and in letters are lists of people whose por- .
traits Roberts painted. Before the War, Roberts

painted in Henry County, Va., in Yanceyville,

and in Danville. After the War he paintdd again

 

 
ROBERTS -9-

in Danville, but, in 1869, went to Shelbyville,
Ky., where he painted many portraits. His let-
ters to his wife from Jan. to July, 1869, contain
full accounts of his work. One letter, April 4,
1869, describes in detail a portrait of Susie Mex
Meriwether (near Christiansburg, Ky.) which did
much to add tohis patronage while in the vicinity
of Shelbyville. His letters mention Mr. Grasty,
evidently John 8, Grasty, a Presbyterian minister
formerly from Danville, Va., who solicited work

for Roberts,

 

Asige from his life

& the Army and his

 
ROBERTS ~10—-

work as an artist, Roberts' papers are important
for his religious interests. He began as a Me-
thodist with a strong interest in sermons and
conversions, but became interested in the teach-
ings of Alexander Campbellbefore the Civil War.
Included are papers bearing on Roberts! trial
and evident dism&ssal from the Methodist£Church

 

for opposing certain Metrnodist doctrines, Chief
among the correspondents relative to the Church
of Christ were Blder Lewis A.Cutler of Virginia

and Josephus Lathan of Pitt County, N.C. Both
men were anxious to spread the teachings of the

 
ROBERTS ~ll=

Christian Church, Many of Roberts’ reminiscences
or scribblings relate details of his conversion £&
to the Christian Church. At one time he decided
to become a minister and often his letters show

a streak of religious fanaticism and a great fear
of death. He also corresponded with a number of
Christians (or members of the Disciples ofChrist)
from Shelbyville, Ky., giving many interesting
facts about that church in Kentucky, Included
also are covies of letters of Roberts to friends
of Alexander Campbell and two letters of Mrs,

 

Alexander Campbell generally relative to a por-

 
ROBERTS -12~
trait which Roberts painted from a portrait of
Alexander Campbell.

Roberts, an addict of morphine from 1862 unti
the end of his life, kept the matter under cover
for many years, but after 1880, his letter and
scribblings are filled with accounts of his
early use of morphine which he attributed to fa-
cial neuralgia, which was evidently sinus trouble
efforts to stop the use of morphine; remedies
which he took to stop the habit; outertes against

his wife whom he came to despise when under
HEXBX the influence of morphine; and many erratic

 

 
ROBERTS -13-
musings on religious matters,

A series of three letters from Charles Napo-
leon Bonaparte Evans, the famous Fool Killer of
the Milton Chronicle, and copies of letters of
Roberts to him in regard to a dispute between the
two relative to a portrait painted by Roberts.

Included also are many letters, not too lit-

 

 

erate, from Roberts' wife usually relative to
their children, financial troubles, his many com-
plaints, and various personal matters. There are

also many personal letters from Roberts! bro-

ther, James L. Roberts. The prother's letters

 
ROBERTS -14-
were not very literate and were generally unin-=
teresting with the exception of one dated Avril
1, 1869, describing Judge Tourgee's method of
conducting court.

1568-1938, Annapolis, Maryland. Sketch,

1846 pieces,

The collection entered under this name com-
prises the manuscript items of the large body of
Filipiniana gathered together by Dr. Robertson,
James A, Robertson (1873-1939) was born in Corry
Penna. ,educated at Western Reserve University,
and engaged in historical research for several
years. He served as librarian of the Philippine
Library, Manila, 1910-1916) and it was during
this period that his Philippine collection was
first built up. Dr. Robertson was later @ssoci-
ated with the a vs Commerce (1917-1923)

 

 

 
Robertson, James Alexander, Sketch, (2)

was professor of history at John B,.Stetson Uni-
versity (1923-1933); and Archivist at the Hall o
of Records, Annapolis, Md.,from 1935 to his
death on March 20,1939. He was editor of the

Hispanic American Historical Review; edited(with
Emma Helen Blair) The Philippine Tsiands, 1493-
1898 (55 vols. ,1902-09); compiled Bibliography

 

of the Philippine Islands (1908); edited many
other works, contributed to many reviews, and
was a member of many learned societies.

The collection contains a limited amount of
Dr. Robertson's own correspondence qnd a large
body of his notes and ks in manuscript and
typescript relating op - Philippines,

 
Robertson, James Alexander, Sketch, (3)

 

The main body of the letters centers, however,
around James Alfred LeRoy, who spené several
years in the Philippines and was one of the best
informed authorities regarding those islands,
JAMES ALFRED LeROY (Dec. 9, 1875 - Feb. 28, 1909
was born at Pontiac, Michigan, the son of Edward
and Jennie LeRoy, He was educated in the public

schools of that city and then at the University
of Michigan. He was a brilliant student and pa
ticipated iw many college activities, particula
ly journalism, Graduating in 1896, he became

principal of the Pontiac high school for one yea
and then joined the staff of the Detroit Free

Press,

 

 
Robertson, James Alexander, Sketch, (4)

He was later connected with varidus New York and
Baltimore papers, and later had connections in
Washington. Just before going to the Philippine
in 1900 he married Mabel Pound of Pontiac.

When the second Philippine dommissiion was ap-
pointed in 1900 its members included William How
ard Taft, Luke Edward Wright, Henry Clay Ide, and
Dean Conant Worcester, The last named had al-
ready been in the Philippines as a member of the
first Gommission, was a zodlogiét, and a member
of the faculty at the University of Michigan,

This doubtless accounts for the fact that Jas
A. LeRoy went to the Philippines in 1900 as Wor-
cester's private cecre® tary. LeRoy remained

 

 
Robertson, James Alexander, Sketch, (5)
there for almost three years, absorbing a great
deal of information about the islands and devot-
ing much of his own time to research in Philip-
line history.

He returned to the United States in 1903
rather broken in health from overwork and the
tropical climate. Incipient tuberculosis made

 

his removal to a better climate imperative.
Through the good offices of William Howard Taft
and other influential friends LeRoy was appoint-

ed United States consul at Durango, Mexico,w
he remained until 1907, In 1905 he published"?

Philippine Life in Town and Countr & volume on
th, popular side but @ contents much valuabk

 
Robertson, James Alexander, Sketch, (6)

information and comment. The Philippines and the
Filipinos and Apolinario Mabini on the Failure a
the Filipino Revolution appeared in 1906. LeRoy'g
large and serious work,The Americans in the Phil
ippines (Boston,1914, 2 vols.)was the producé of
unrelenting determination,much of ite being writ
ten when he was very 111, It was incomplete at t

 

 

 

the time of his death, but was prepared for publi
cation Sarough the assistance of several friends

Poor health forced LeRoy to decline the consul
ship at Madrid in 1906, and late in 1907 he resig
ned his post at Durango. Early in 1908 he became
80 111 with tuberculosis that he was admitted to
the army hospital at oe" Bayard,New Mexico

 
Robertson, James Alexander, _ Sketch, (Zy)
Here he remained until his rather sudden death
on February 28, 1909, He left a wife and three
small children, (A long obituary by Epifanio de
lost Santos Cristobal appeared in La Democracia
(Manila), March 16, 1909. See Newspaper Dept. )

 

LeRoy was obviously a young man of decided
ability. It seems likely that his ambition and

vast interest in things Philippine led to over-
work which hastened his death.

The letters of this collection are in part
from Filipino leaders. Many are written in Span
ish and one large group is in German. Thesesare
from Prof. Ferdinand er of Leitmeritz,

 
Robertson, James Alexander 8
Austria, wno was apparently a noted scholar in
Far Eastern history. The letters as a whole
relate to Philippine matters and contain much
comment on the history of the islands and on
current administrative policies during the earl
years of American oCcupation. They reflect the
hard work and high-minded enthusiasm of many
American officials there. All the letters of
Blumentritt, except one which is addressed to
Robertson, were written to Dr. Adolph B. Meyer
of Dresden, a close friend and one interested
in the Philippines primarily as an ethnologist,

 

 
Rohertson, James Alexander 9
fne originals of the letters from Blumentritt
to Meyer were given to the Library of Congress
by Meyer as a contribution to the history of
the Philippine Revolution, and later Philipp-
ine-American relations. Actually the photo-
stats of Blumentritt letters in this collect-
ion represent only a small fraction of the

 

Blumentritt-Meyer correspondence in the Library
of Congress which runs from 1894 to at least
1909,

This collection contains many letters of

William Howard Taft while Philippine Commission-

er and Secretary of War.

1371 items added include many of Robertson's
notes and works in manuscript and typescript
and some printed articles pertaining to the
Philippines. Some of the subjects with which
they deal are: Aglipay or Independent Filipino
Church, Roman Catholicism, customs, geography,

James Barr Robertson was a British resident
of Shanghai ca. 1870. He was a member of the
Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and was a
shareholder and board member of several compa=
nies, including the Shanghai Steamship Navi-

gation Co, and the Union Steamship Navigation
Co. He also occasionally wrote articles for
journals about China and British policy towards
_China. Biographical information about
Robertson and some of his correspondents was

 
 

Robertson, James Barr 2
primarily obtained from scattered news items in
the North China Herald and Supreme Court Con-
sular Gazette, 1869-1871.
Six letters from W.U. Lay, dated August 29,
September 6, October 5, and December 1 (2),
1869, and October 31, are written from or near
Yokohama , Japan. They are primarily concerned

 

with Lay's proposal to form an Association of
China and Japan and a journal or paper to rep-
resent British and American views on Chinese
and Japanese affairs to the British public.
The name of the journal was to be the Homeward

 
Robertson, James Barr

 

Pacific Mail, with W.G. Howell as editor in

Yokohama, and Robertson as a contributing
editor in Shanghai. The letters also discuss
the Japan Times and conditions in China and
Japan.

Five letters from Charles Wycliffe Goodwin
(November 19 and 30, 1870 and January 19, April
6 and 26, 1871), president of the North China
Branch of the Asiatic Society and a British
judge, are mainly concerned with the scheduling
of meetings.

A letter from Edward Cunningham, chairman of

 

 
Robertson, James Barr

 

of the Shanghai Municipal Council, dated
October 7, 1869, discusses Anson Burlingame,
and mentions President Grant's concerns about
Burlingame as expressed to Richard M, Johnson,
the new American consul at Hankow.

Two letters from G.F.L. in Orange, N.J.,
dated May 29 and 30, 1881, discuss water supply
and tunnel projects in the New York City area.

A letter from T, Hanbury, dated September
12, invites Robertson to his farewell party as

The 1944 papers consist principally of let-

tary personnel from twenty-four states addressed
to Mr. Robertson for his having relayed to them

messages concerning their "fighting members
whose names were heard over the short wave
broadcasts from Germany to which he listened
sometimes into the wee hours of the morning".
It is said that he wrote hundreds of postal

cards relaying messages_to families of persons

 
Robertson, Marvin Leake 2
in military service whomhe had heard on short
wave broadcasts. There are also lists of many
service people, usually with their serial num-
ber and home address given. Mr. Robertson had
enlisted in the Army at the beginning of World
War I.

 

There are two publications in the collection
that contain biographical sketches of Mr.
Robertson, who according to Miss Florence Blake-
ly, died on October 5, 1976. He was an agent
for the Columbia, Newberry, and Laurens Railway
at Joanna. For almost half a century he was in

railroading. For 32 1/2 years he rendered
telegraph service to the community of Goldville

and later Joanna.

provided several men to the Confederate Army.
James, Josiah S., and William W. Robertson all
served in Co. H., 22nd Regiment, N.C. Troops.
James served during 1861-1865. William died in
1861. Josiah served during 1864-1865. Josiah

is apparently the same person as Joseph S.
Robertson who is listed in North Carolina
Troops, 1861-1865, Vol. VII, p. 77. Their
father was Reuben Robertson to whom many of the

 

 

 
Robertson, Reuben 2

 

letters are addressed. In 1856 he was
addressed at Colesville, a community in north-
ern Stokes County, near which he apparently
lived.

The identification of this collection is
complicated by the fact that family members, as
well as other persons, spelled the family name

in various ways. James Robertson himself
spelled it Robertson, Roberson, Robison, and
Robinson. Some, if not all, of his letters
were written for him by other persons. Josiah

 
Robertson, Reuben

 

spelled the name as Roberson. Reuben, who
served in the 77th Regiment in 1864-1865,
spelled the name both as Robinson and Roberson.
The spelling of the family name used in cata-
loging this collection is the version used in
North Carolina Troops, 1861-1865. Reuben, who
wrote these letters, was the father of James,

 

Josiah, and William. On Nov. 29, 1864, Reuben
wrote to his wife and children and addressed
her as Palina. On Dec. 16, 1864, Josiah wrote
to his mother addressing her as Palina.

 
Robertson, Reuben

Most of the correspondence is during the
Civil War, and James Robertson's letters are
the most numerous. His letters are from: Wake
County, N.C., and Spotsylvania or Fredericks-
burg, Va., in 1861; Fredericksburg, Camp Win-
der and a camp also near Richmond, and Rapidan
River in 1862; Randolph Hospital at Richmond,
Camp Gregg, Camp Jackson Hospital at Richmond,
and a camp near Orange Court House in 1863; a
camp near Orange Court House, and prison at
Point Lookout, Md., in 1864.

 

 
Robertson, Reuben 5

 

Josiah Robertson's fourteen letters of 1864-
1865 are from Petersburg, Virginia. They are
interesting for their indications of the morale
of the common soldiers during the last months
of the war.

Reuben Robertson's three letters of 1864-
1865 are from Camp Jarvis, Camp Whiting near

Wilmington, and General Hospital No. 11 at
Charlotte, all in North Carolina.

Caleb W. Hall wrote twice from prison at
Johnsons Island, Ohio, in 1864.

 
Robertson, Reuben

There are a small number of letters from
other persons during the Civil War. Letters
before and after the war are not numerous.
There are also a few pieces of poetry, at least
two of which date from the Civil War. The cor-
respondence primarily reflects camp life.

There is also a small, undated account book,
owner not identified, that contains entries
related to agriculture.

This collection is an amalgamation of three
groups of letters originally cataloged

The majority of these letters are addressed to
Andrew Strahan,the King's Printer,and deal with
questions in connection with the publication of

 

Charles V and the translation and publication of
Historical Disquisitions. The letters are inte
esting because of the importance of the writer
and because they shed some light on the problems

Robertson-Scott, John William. Papers, 15395-
1943. Idbury, Oxfordshire, England

John William Robertson-Scott (1866-1963),
British journalist and author, was associated
with the Pall Mall Gazette, the Westminister
Gazette, and the Daily Chronicle during 1887-
1899. He founded and edited the New East of
Tokyo in 1915 and contributed to the Times,
Spectator, Nation, Quarterly Review, etc. He
was the founder and editor of The Countryman,
1927-1947, and was the author of numerous books
about rural life at home and abroad and about

newspaper life and experience. For some years

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Robertson-Scott, John William 2
he served on an advisory committee of the
Ministry of Health. Biographical information
appears in Who's Who, 1963 and in Kelly's
Jepcuoss to the Titled and Official Classes
1960.

There are twenty-three letters of 1895-1943
from Frederick John Dealtry Lugard, First Baron

 

 

 

Lugard (1858-1945), British soldier, adminis-
trator, and author, who had an important role
in the expansion of British authority in East

Africa and Nigeria.

 
Robertson-Scott, Jonn William os

The earlier letters of 1895 concern arrange-
ments for meetings between Lugard and Robertson
Scott. On Dec. 19 and 21 Lugard was planning
to introduce his friend to Leopold James Maxse,
editor of the National Review.

The Masai committed a massacre at Eldama
Ravine, Kenya, in 1895, and Lugard had a contro-

 

 

versy about it with a contributor to the Times.
His letters of Dec. 24, 1895, and Jan. 1, 1696,
refer to the controversy, and the latter
includes reaction to the Jameson Raid in the

 
Robertson-Scott, John William 4
Transvaal. He deplored the effect of the
article in the Times on the slavery issue about
which he was soon to publish an article with
Sir James Thomas Knowles, editor of the
Nineteenth Century.

On Feb. 19, 1896, Lugard acknowledged an
article favorable to him and announced his

 

 

imminent departure for Africa. Several days
later (Feb. 25) he elaborated upon the purpose
of this trip - the exploitation of the British
West Charterland Company's mineral concession

 
Robertson-Scott, John william 5

in Ngami, Bechuanaland. He commented on the
company's relationship to Joseph Chamberlain,
the government, and the British South Africa
Company. On Sept. 8 he wrote during his journe
across the Kalahari Desert to Ngami and
described the obstacles caused by the environ-
ment and by the war in Rhodesia. The government
had promised him an East African appointment,
but the death of Sir Henry Percy Anderson,
Assistant Under Secretary at the Foreign Office
put the matter in doubt. However, the removal

 

 
Robertson-Scott, John William 6

of Anderson opened the possibility of abolishing
the legal status of slavery in Zanzibar.

Lugard had insisted that his command of a main-
land protectorate not be under the authority of
Sir Arthur Henry Hardinge whose views on slaver
he opposed. He also noted Lord Salisbury's
doubts about the Congo State story, the need to
occupy the leased territories in the Nile Valley
plans to alleviate the famine in Bechuanaland,
the cattle disease there, and the Royal Societys
interest in the tsetse fly.

 

 
Robertson-Scott, John William 7

On Sept. 27, 1898, Lugard acknowledged a
publication about him.

Four undated letters probably were written in
1898. There are other letters addressed from
London during the autumn of that year. Im one
of the letters Lugard mentioned wanting to
review three books on East Africa that were

 

published during 1895-1897. One of the authors
was Sir James Ronald Leslie Macdonald, about
whose career in Uganda Lugard related an
episode.

On Jan. 1, 1923, he noted the threatening

 
Robertson-Scott, John William 8
situation in Uganda but did not elaborate.

Some. years later (Apr. 26, 1935), he
reflected on the decline in quality of London's
evening newspapers.

On March 31, 1943, he referred to a few line
he had published.in The Countryman about
colonial policy. On Aug. 30 he criticized the

 

 

government's education policy in its African

colonies and referred Robertson-Scott to the

work of the International African Institute.

George Maxwell Robeson (1829-1897) was U. S.
Secretary of the Navy (1869-1877) and a former
U. S. Army General.

This collection consists of one fragmentary
business letter of Feb. 2, 1872, to Robeson from

 

an unnamed party in Mobile, Ala., asking for the
retention of a Republican officeholder in that
state, a Col. J. P. Southworth, U. S. District
Attorney. Southworth, affirms our anonymous
correspondent, has been too zealous for his own
good. He had not put & the test oath to the

 
Robeson, George Maxwell 2
jurors, because the judge had discountenanced it,
in a previous term. No juries at all could be
had if the oath were insisted upon. So the

U. S. Circuit Court Judge, William Burnham

Woods (1824-1887), later an Associate Justice on
the Supreme Court, directed that the oath be

 

abandoned on the Ground that no jury could be
had without such action.

Robinson, Benjamin. Papers, 1760-1912.
Fayetteville, Cumberland Co., N. C.

 

The papers of Dr. Benjamin Robinson (1775-
1857) are those of a physician who also served
as a public health officer and banker. He
was born in Bennington, Vermont, into a large
and distinguished family who hada founded that

town in 1761. His early years are not clearly
described, but it is probable he was the son of
Colonel Samuel Robinson (1738-1313). Young
Benjamin Robinson must have met a number of

 
Robinson, Benjamin

 

prominent Americans in the 1790's when his
family was actively engaged in Republican
politics. By 1801 he was in Alexandria,
Virginia, tradition having it that Thomas
Jefferson influenced him to settle in that
state. Dr. walter Jones of Virginia
recommended that he be admitted to the lectures

of Dr. Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia in 1503,
when he was returning from Virginia to his
Vermont home. (See Benjamin Rush Papers,
Trent Col. in the Hist. of Medicine, Med.
Center Library; Larkin Newby MSS. and Wm. N.

 
Robinson, Benjamin

 

Tillinghast Mss. in MS. Dept. of Perkins
Library).

By 1805 br. Benjamin Robinson had come to
Fayetteville, N. C., as did his brother, Dr.
Hiram Robinson, at an undetermined date.

There Dr. Benjamin married Eliza West Pearce,
daughter of a Rhode Island family who had also
settled in the Cape Fear River Valley. Dr.
Robinson built "Monticello," a beautiful home
about a mile west of Fayetteville on what is
now Rowan Street. Into this house he accepted
a few patients for treatment, thus providing

 
Robinson, Benjamin

the first hospital in Fayetteville. The
annex or shop at "Monticello" was built in
1848.

The Robinson papers begin with a folder on
genealogy. Obviously this comes from the
descendants of Benjamin Robinson's youngest
son, Thomas Jefferson Robinson, who married

 

Sarah Starke Huske on Jan. 1, 1852. This

branch of the family collected data on the
Huskes, Tillinghasts, Norwoods, Hoggs, and
related groups. Unfortunately they did not

 
Robinson, Benjamin 5

 

give details of the Robinson genealogy.

The relation of the Hoggs of Hillsborough
to Sir walter scott is explained. There is a
copy of a lengthy chart of the Cromartie
family, the original of which belongs to Mr.
Junius P. Cromartie, grandson of Sarah
Starke (Huske) Robinson.

The letters, 1804-1818, concern family
matters of the Pearce-Tillinghast group into
which Dr. Robinson married. Of genealogical
note is a letter dated Oct. 12, 1815, from

 
Robinson, Benjamin 6

 

John E. Robinson of Bennington to his cousin
Benjamin who had returned to Fayetteville
from a visit to his family in Vermont.

On Jan. 2, 1818, correspondence begins on
the business of the Fayetteville branch of the
State Bank of North Carolina. Benjamin
Robinson became head of the Fayetteville branch
which involved him in correspondence with
William Boylan of Raleigh and Elihu Chauncey
of Pennsylvania. His financial situation in
Fayetteville may have inspired an appeal to

 
Robinson, Benjamin

 

Vermont Congressman O. C. Merrill for a federal

job. Again in 1824 Dr. Robinson secured

letters of introduction for a visit to the

West as a preliminary: to settlement there.
Robinson's accounts with the State Bank of

North Carolina as head of the Fayetteville

branch were overdue, so that he mortgaged his

property to his brother, Dr. Hiram Robinson,

who covered this debt. (See legal papers).
Meanwhile he seems to have considered

moving to Florida or Alabama. He was public

 
Robinson, Benjamin fe}

 

health officer at Fayetteville and directed a
campaign against smallpox in 1824-1825. (See
folder on the smallpox epidemic for details.)
The letters of Benjamin Robinson end in
1826. Those of his son Thomas Jefferson
Robinson (1827-1879) begin in 1877. A student
at the University of North Carolina, 1846-1849,

Thomas Jefferson Robinson was a civil engineer
who became assistant professor at the U. 5.
Naval Observatory. He served in the C. 5. A.
Army. By 1877 he had returned to Fayetteville

 
Robinson, Benjamin

 

and was appointed secretary of the North
Carolina Board of Agriculture. His wife
Sarah Starke (Huske) Robinson (ca. 1832-1912)
and his daughter Elizabeth Beatty (Robinson)
Cromartie (1855-1934) preserved the Robinson
papers as we have them. On Jan. 16 and Feb. 6,
1884, Henry J. Pearce gives anvehas of Pearce
family genealogy. ,(owtrst2e Calas

The special folder’on the smallpox epidemic
contains papers relative to that epidemic
in Fayetteville and the nearby plantations from

 
Robinson, Benjamin 10

 

Dec. 9, 1824, to Feb. 19, 1825. The commiss
sioners of Fayetteville had appointed Dr.
Robinson health officer. His accounts to them
cover expenses for a hospital, doctors,
services, medicines, and a hospital carriage.
Dr. Hiram Robinson's name appears on the list
of physicians giving service. A statistical

chart for the nineteen cases was prepared by
br. Benjamin Robinson, who reported Feb. l,
1825, to William Belvidere Meares, Magistrate
of Police at Wilmington, that the epidemic was

 
Robinson, Benjamin

 

subsiding with the aid of police who enforced
quarantine.

The miscellany contains a.number of small
volumes: the poetry of Polly (West) Pearce,
1783; recipes dating ca. 1820, probably
belonging to Anne Powell (Tillinghast) Huske;
a long address at the 1895 centennial of the
University of North Carolina by Joseph
Caldwell Huske; a commonplace book by Sarah
Starke (Huske) Robinson dating from 1551;
and a fragment of her diary, 1885.

 
Robinson, Benjamin 12

 

Financial papers concern the business of
Oliver and Nathan Pearce, rental property in
Providence, R&R. I., receipts for children of
this group at Fayetteville and Donaldson
academies, and expenses of a trip to Virginia
and Washington, D. C., in 1840.

These papers reveal that Dr. Hiram

Robinson was still in Fayetteville in 1832.
There is a separate folder of bills and

receipts of Mrs. Anne Powell (Tillinghast)

Huske, mother of Sarah Starke (Huske)

Tittinghast.

 
Robinson, Benjamin he

 

Three miscellaneous items were added to the
financial papers from the ledger of 1814-1817
which was with this collection.

The Legal Papers contain deeds and indentures
for land purchased and sold by the Pearces,
Larkin Newby, and Benjamin and Hiram-Robinson
in Cumberland County. Papers pertaining to

the loan by Dr. Hiram to Dr. Benjamin ca. 1824
to cover indebtedness: to the State Bank of
North Carolina also show Dr. Hiram Robinson
deeding to Mrs. Eliza (Pearce) Robinson and

 
Robinson, Benjamin 14

 

her children the property (“Monticello"?) he
had taken as security for the loan.

The volume in these papers is partly an old
ledger of the mercantile firm of Newby and
McIntosh, 1514-1819, and partly a diary kept
ca. 1884-1911, by Sarah Starke (Huske)
Robinson, wife of Jefferson Robinson.

As a ledger it is valuable for the list of
Fayetteville citizens, 1814-1819. The accounts
themselves give few if any details of the
articles purchased. This relatively large

 
Robinson, Benjamin 15

 

business was conducted by Larkin Newby, who
had married Cecelia Walker Pearce, niece of
Mrs. Benjamin Robinson. Roderick McIntosh,
his partner, appears on many pages. About
13820 the business met with disaster and seems
to have ended in that year. See the Larkin
Newby MSS. in this department.

The diary, 1884-1911, in this volume notes
the activities and names of the large Pearce,
Huske, Tillinghast, Robinson, Hogg, and Newby
families, as well as various developments in

 
Robinson, Benjamin 16

 

the history of Fayetteville in the late nine-
teenth century. Mrs. Jefferson Robinson gives
historical notes on "Monticello," its annex,
its sale by the heirs of Dr. Benjamin west
Robinson, and its destruction by fire (see
entries for 31 Oct. 1899, 6 Nov. 1901,

8 Apr. 1902, and 26 Apr. 1902). The final
dissolution of the "Monticello" estate, sold
to the be Rosset Development Company of
Wilmington in 1905, came when it was made into
lots, walks, and avenues of “Monticello Heights

 
Robinson, Benjamin

It is interesting to note that Mrs.
Jefferson Robinson called her own home
"Monticello," a fact which leads to confusion
in her diary. This was not the original

Commander in Chief of the Army. Their letters
(seven are from Cambridge) concern a variety

of military subjects.

On February 1, 1864, Austrian and Prussian
armies go to war with Denmark over the posses-
sion of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein.
The Duke of Cambridge takes this occasion to

 
Robinson, George Frederick Samuel, First 33
Marguis of Ripon
cite the reduced strength of the British mili-
tary establishment and to make proposals for
correcting this weakness (letter of Feb. 2,
1864). This letter is printed in William
Willoughby Cole Verner, The Military Life of
H.R.H. George, Duke of Cambridge (London, 1905),
I, 206-288. On February the Duke again ex-
presses opinions on the crisis and war over the
Schleswig-Holstein Question.

During the 1860's the British army in New

zealand is engaged in a campaign against the
Maoris. On February 8, 1864, the Duke of Cam-
bridge notes with satisfaction the recent Brit-
ish victories, but he regrets their heavy losses
especially of officers. In December, 1864, how-
ever, the war news from New Zealand is so bad

 

that the Duke exempts the army there from the
planned reductions in the military establish-
ment. He also criticizes the bungling that al-
lowed the escape of two hundred Maori prisoners

 
Robinson, George Frederick Samuel, First 5
Marquis of Ripon,
from Kawau Island to the mainland. On December
21 Cambridge passes on to Ripon’a memorandum on
Lord Dundonald's plan of "destructive Balls"
that may be applicable to New Zealand. Although
the Duke dislikes such "horrible inventions,"
he submits the matter to Ripon, Cambridge also
notes the army's acceptance of "bullet shells"
that he thinks might be tried in the Maori War.
On December 16 the Duke suggests some arrange
ments for the army reductions. Details of the

Marquis of Ripon.
discussions and plans for the reductions appear
in the Army and Navy Gazette, a fact that dis-
turbs the Duke, who fears that the leak origi-
nated in the War Office (letter of Dec. 21).
Appointments, promotions, and comments on a
number of prominent army officers appear in the

 

 

correspondence. Two vacancies in the Royal
Artillery provoke consideration of the procedure
for officer promotion. - whether it should be
based on army seniority or regimental seniority.

 
Robinson, George Frederick Samuel, First
Marquis of Ripon.
Cambridge reviews the recent history of this
question and explains his own procedure. He
also notes the recommendation of the Royal Com-
mission of 1854 on promotions and the fact that
Lord Cathcart, Sir Hume Ross, and Sir John
Burgoyne dissented from it,(Dec. 17).

Prominent army officers whose appointments
are noted or commented upon in 1864 are:
l. Airey, Richard, Lord Airey (Dec. 16,21);
2. Clifford, Sir Henry Hugh: (Dec. 16);

Miscellaneous topics are: Disagreement be-

Chief in India (Feb. 8); the role of Stephen C.
Denison, Deputy Judge Advocate General, in the
court martial of Colonel Crawley, a case under
occasional discussion in Parliament in February
and March (Feb. 19); and the desirability of
keeping the headquarters of the North American
Command at Montreal (Dec. 16).

In addition to Verner's biography of the
Duke, there is an autobiographical work - Edgar
Sheppard, ed., George Duke of Cambridge (London
1906), 2 vols. Several chapters of Verner's
biography contain additional correspondence
between Cambridge and Lord Ripon for 1864 and
other years, and most of these letters do not
appear in the index,

On August 6, 1885, Lord Ripon requests from
an unidentified addressee two copies of a leaf-

Victor Robinson, physician, author, medical
historian, and editor was born on August 16,
1886, the son of Dr. William J. Robinson
(1869-1936), also an author and editor. His
papers concern medical history publications.

They begin on May 5, 1910, with a letter
from Dr. Otto Juettner (1865-1922) of
Cincinnati to his father, Wm. J. Robinson, who
was editing the Critic and Guide. Juettner,

 

 
Robinson, Victor z

 

who published his Daniel Drake and his Followers
in 1909, was interested in medical history and
mentions Victor Robinson's medico-historical
sketches. Robinson in 1922 received a letter
from Mrs. Juettner describing Juettner's
physical condition.

From the Johns-Hopkins Institute of the

 

History of Medicine, Henry Ernest Sigerist
wrote on April 5 and May 16, 1934, concerning
an article which Dr. Robinson was to publish
in Medical Life. Both Henry Sigerist and

 

 
Robinson, Victor 3

 

Arturo Castiglioni were friends of Robinson.
Dr. Sigerist wrote again on publishing on
Feb. 2, 1937. The program of the farewell
dinner to Dr. Sigerist on May 9, 1947, is
included, as well as a review of his Man and
Medicine.

Robinson's friendship with Arturo Castiglioni
is reflected in letters about the latter's
works from J. R. de la Torre Bueno, Jr., and
Alfred A. Knopf. Castiglioni writes on June 19,
1945, and Sept. 4, » two friendly letters

 
Robinson, Victor
to Robinson, who also has a Castiglioni
Christmas card and bookplate.

Other correspondents of Dr. Robinson are

The letters are written from Robinson to his

various places. One of them speaks at length
of the good food at camp Carolina, near Norfolk,
Virginia. He apparently volunteered as a pri-

vate early in 1861, but by 1862 was suffering
the hardships of active army life, and wrote of
his lack of supplies and clothing.

at Columbia, S. C., when she wrote this volume,
her Classroom Notebook, 1902-1903, It contains
her notes on two lectures by Dr. James Woods

Babcock and six lectures by Dr. Sarah C. Allan.
These people are listed in the city directory
of Columbia for 1903.

Dr. James W. Babcock (1856-1922), a prominent
psychiatrist, was superintendent and physician

of the State Hospital for the Insane. His lec-
tures concerned the problem of fire in hospitals
and the care of the insane in private families.
Dr. Sarah C. Allan was assistant physician of
the State Hospital. The topics of her six lec-
tures were: obstetrics, signs of pregnancy,
management of pregnancy, preparation for labor,
labor and nurses' duties, and abnormal con-
ditions.

This set is for the most part cnncerned with
the business of John N. Robson of Charleston,
S.C. Robson was a fertilizer agent working
for the General Agency out of Baltimore,
Maryland, His chief product was Soluable
Pacific Guano, although he handled other fer-
tilizers as well as other products. The

 
ROBSON, JOHN N. Sketch (2)

guano that he sold was evidently used auite
extensively by cotton planters. Judging from
the letters Robson received requesting orders,
this particular fertilizer must have been
widely advertised. Many of the orders placed
with Robson were on credit, with the farmers
often depending upon the season's cotton cron
to enable them to pay their fertilizer bill.
Robson avdpears to have done a sizeable busi-
ness, as is evidenced by the fact that his

 

monthly sales fcollections?]} for Detember

 
ROBSON, JOHN N. Sketch (3)
1868 totaled $62,00.00.

During the period around 1873 there are
a number of letters from vaious dealers com-
plaining of their inability to f4111 their or-
ders because of their limited supply of fer-
tilizer. This dealer shortage appears to
have been caused by two factors: (1) diffi-
cutty of transportation, applicable particu-
larly to the railroads, and (2) either an
actualy shortage in the company's agencies or

 

shortcomings in their System of distripytion

 
ROBSON, JOHN N. Sketch (4)
and allocation.

There are several letters which tell of
the Grange Movement centering around Lancaster
County, S. C. The Grange in this section
was desirous of obtaining a considerable dis-
count from Robson on their fertilizer orders.

The set contains only a few personal let-
ters of little consequence. However, there is
some correspondence between Robson and his son,
whose full name 1s not revealed by the letters.

 

It &ppéars that in about 1883 Robson took

 
Robson, John N, Ma 5
his son into partnership with him.

The collection is chiefly valuable for the
light thrown on the fertilizer business in the
1880's and incidentally for activities of the
Patrons of Husbandry or the Grange.

By 1860 he was a lieutenant, and, shortly
after the outbreak of the Civil War, was com-
missioned lieutenant-commander in the Confederate
Navy. Before the war ended he was promoted to
captain. The letters of the Civil War period,
though largely of a routine nature, are valuable
for information on activiites in and around

Charleston harbor. One item, dated June 8, 1863,
is a copy of an account by Rochelle of the wreck

Amazon, Rochelle was senior member of the expe-

acting president, In this capacity he received
numbers of official despatches from the Peruvian
government. Besides these there are included
hists of Supplies, notes on methods of finding
elevations by boiling water, of changing metres

 
to inches, Fahrenheit to Centigrade, etc; tables
of Spanish measurements, altitudes above sea le-
vel of various locations, and latitude and longi-

for sparse references totowns, and flora and
fauna of the Amazon Valley, there 1s little in-

Rockwell, Alfred Perkins. Papers. Norwich,
London. Co., Conn,

Rockwell (1834-1903) was a mining engineer
and soldier. He studied mining engineering two
years at Yale, one year at the Museum of Practi-
cal Geology, London, and one year at the School
of Mines, Freiberg, Saxony. He was an officer
in the Civil War and was cited for gallantry.
Later he was professor of mining at Yale's
Sheffield Scientific School (1865-1868) and at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1868-
L873) «

The collection contains two notebooks numbered

 

 
Rockwell, Alfred Perkins 2

 

three and four by Rockwell and written by him
during 1857-1859. They contain notes about
different mining operations he visited in South
Wales and England. According to his notes,
Rockwell visited the mining operations in 1857
and 1858. However, he does not always include
the date he visited the different mine works.

In one entry dated July 1859, Rockwell commented
that the notes taken on the iron furnaces at the
Tradegar Works near Merthyr-Tydvil were copied
from a young German, Jules Jacobi, who lived

 
Rockwell, Alfred Perkins

 

near Prague, Bohemia. He said he had visited
him in Prague in July, 1859. There are 106
pages of text and diagrams in number three and
57 pages of text and diagrams in number four
with several blank pages in each notebook.
Each notebook is bound in marble boards, sixteen
by ten centimeters. Inside the back cover of
volume three, there are several references to
published works on mining. Three loose pieces
of paper were found inside one of the volumes.
One includes topics that apparently Rockwell

 
Rockwell, Alfred Perkins

 

wanted to cover about the mines. Among them
were the vein, the roof, the floor, the mode of
working, holing (how deep it was) and the mode
of transfering. The two other papers contain
text and some sketches.

Rockwell was a studious recorder of detail.

His notes include specific information on all
facets of mining techniques and equipment.
There are approximately sixty-six pen and ink
sketches in the two notebooks, many complete
with dimensions. They include sketches of mine

 
Rockwell, Alfred Perkins 5
shafts, blast furnaces, coke ovens, ventilation
systems, mining machinery and mining tools.
Occasionally, he included full-page diagrams of
mining tunnels.

Rockwell took notes on mining operations in
the following areas of South Wales and England.

 

In South Wales: Cefu Colliery; coal mines in
Cwn Du; the Cwn Avon Works that include coal
mines, iron furnaces, tin plate and copper works;
the Plymouth Works at Merthyr-Tydvil that in-
clude coal and iron works; the Aberamon Works at

 
Rockwell, Alfred Perkins 6
Aberdare that include fire brick making and coal
mining; Abercam Colliery in Abercam; and the
Ebbw Vale Iron Works in Ebbw Vale. In England:
Parkfield Colliery near Bristol; stone quarries
near Bath; and coal mines near Chesterfield. He
included scattered notes about other mines as
well.

 

While the main emphasis in Rockwell's notes
was given to mining techniques and equipment, he
also provided a glimpse into the living and
working conditions of miners. Speaking about the

 
Rockwell, Alfred Perkins ¥

 

policies at the Cwm Avon Works, he said, "Houses
are built by the Company and leased to the men.
A month's notice is necessary from either side
to terminate the lease--the same as in the
workings--a month's notice being required from
Master or Man. A house of stone substantially
built with four rooms about thirteen feet
square each cost about 75 pounds each." Wages
of the men are cited frequently. In giving
those at the Plymouth Works, a distinction in
salary is made for "men" (if married) and for

 
Rockwell, Alfred Perkins 8
"boys." Rockwell reported how the miners con-
tributed money from their wages for the school,
schoolmaster, doctor and sick fund in Merthyr-
Tydvil.

There are only a few scattered references
made about the hazardous nature of mining and
how mining accidents might be prevented.

 

Through his text and sketches, Rockwell
offers an extensive look at mining techniques as
they were performed in mid-nineteenth century
Great Britain. Coal leases and stipulations for

 
Rockwell, Alfred Perkins )

 

for obtaining them are mentioned. An excerpt
from the rules and regulations of the Newport,
Abergavenny and Hereford Railroad is given. It
pertains to the cost of shipping coals, coke,
limestone and iron ore per ton per mile. It is
signed Pontypool [England] and dated June 14,
1858.

Rear Admiral Raymond Perry Rodgers (1849-
1925) was the son of Rear Admiral Christopher
Raymond Perry Rodgers (1819-1892) and was also
related to Robert Smith Rodgers, whose papers
are in the Department of Manuscripts.

Raymond P. Rodgers was a graduate of the Naval
Academy (1868), naval attaché in France and
Russia (1893-1897), executive officer of the
Iowa during the Spanish-American War, commander
of the Nashville (1899-1901) in the West Indies

 
Rodgers, Raymond FPrerry 2

 

and the Orient, captain of the Kearsarge (1904-
1906) in the Atlantic Fleet, chief intelligence
officer of the Navy Department (1906-1909), and
president of the Naval War College and
commandant of the Naval Station in Narragansett
Bay from 1909 until retirement in 1911.

During 1877-1879, Rodgers was an officer on

the Pensacola, which was the flagship of his
father as commander of the Pacific Fleet,
1878-1880. A Diary, 1876-1879, is identified
with R. P. Rodgers by the references to his
father's appointment to command the Pacific

 
Rodgers, Raymond Perry

 

Fleet (p. 15) and by references to the
Pensacola (pp. 3-4).

The diary (31 pp.) records Rodgers’ trip
from the U. S. to join the fleet in Panama in
late 1876 and thereafter the movements of the
Pensacola and other vessels of the Pacific
Squadron from January, 1877, to April, 1879.
The contents of the diary are often routine.
However, Rodgers noted riots against the
importation of Chinese into San Francisco in
July, 1877. He also supplied descriptions of

 
‘Rodgers, Raymond Perry

 

a number of ports in Mexico, Central and

South America: 1876 - Coldén, Panama (then
Aspinwall, Colombia) and the isthmian railroad;
1877 - Talcahuano, Chile, and Acapulco, San
Blas, Mazatlan, and Pichilinque Bay (near La
Paz), Mexico; 1878 - Guaymas, Pichilinque Bay
and Manzanillo in Mexico, Champerico and San

José in Guatemala, and Acajutla, Libertad,
and La Union, El Salvador; 1879 - the present
Chilean cities of Valparaiso, Coquimbo,
Caldera, Antofagasta, and Iquique. Other

 
Rodgers, Raymond Perry =e

 

notable topics were: a diplomatic incident
between the U. S. and Mexico at Acapulco in
May, 1877; shipwreck of the City of San
Francisco in May, 1877; Chilean naval
operations in early 1879 against the Bolivian
coast that was later ceded to Chile; and
Rodgers* opinion of the Shah, flagship of
Britain's Pacific Fleet, that visited San
Francisco in 1877 (p. 14).

eastern tip of Oahu Island in the Hawaiian

in 1863. He wrote an account of its war exper-
iences which in its present form is fragmentary.
The battle between the Monitor and the Merrimac
and the visit of the Prince de Joinville to the
Minnesota in 1862 begin the narrative. Early
in 1863 the regiment is on guard duty at East-
ville, Va., in the Potomac blockade. As tensio
mounts in the countryside with Lee's invasion
of Pennsylvania, Rodgersbecomes part of the

On May 1, the 2nd Eastern Shore moves out with
Gen. Franz Sigel's Union troops of the Depart-
ment of West Virginia to Winchester and up the

Shenandoah Valley. The 2nd Eastern Shore was
stationed along the. B. and 0. R. R. between Hare
per's Ferry and Martinsburg, Sigel's base of
supplies. Raids and skirmishing are followed by

 
 

@ march to Woodstock, Va., and to New Market,
where Sigel is defeated by Early on May 5, 186).
Rodgers records the reasons the Union officers
give for this reverse.

in Harrisonburg, Va., by June 2, Rodgers and
the regiment take part in the Battle of Piedmont

on June 5. They are now under General David
Hunter's command in Col. Joseph Thoburn's 2nd
Brigade. Rodgers graphically describes the
body of Confederate General William Edmonson

Smith who died on the battlefield. The name of

Hunter's command moves through Staunton, Va.,
toward Lynchburg, but its repulse by General
Early on June 17-18, 186), sends the Union troops
on a withdrawal to West Virginia. At Salem,
June 21, and in the action at New Castle on

June 23, Rodgers describes mountain scenery and
beconss confused as to correct dates. He mar=-

because of stiff Confederate resistance. The
U. S. Army, VI Corps, under General Wright goes
off to Washington, while the 2nd Eastern Shore

skirmishes its way to Winchester. They return
by way of Halltown. Here Rodgers describes the
fighting VI Corps. On July 26, 186, he notes
the strength of the garrison at Harper's Ferry.
Terrible heat causes straggling, as the regiment

Eastern Shore Regiment of Infantry Volunteers,
Maryland. The papers, with the exception of
a few personal items, are military in character.
Many are orders of various generals in the
Middle Military Department and in the Depart-
ment of West Virginia. The papers parallel
the reminiscent account written later by Rodgers
of his Civil War experiences with the 2nd
Eastern Shore. Because Rodgers! narrative is
fragmentary, these additional papers are a
valuable source of information. 4.0 a) 1¥¢/, Kew

of 1861, when Rodgers was presumably major
under Colonel Edward B. Wilkins (1813-1878),
who originated this Home Guard unit. Service
began in the Middle Military Department under
Major General John Ellis Wool, whose General
Order No. 13 placed a curfew on soldiers on the
streets of Baltimore.

 

The regimental lieutenant colonel, Elijah
E. Massey, seems to have functioned as head
for a time in 1862 when Col. Wilkins left the
regiment because his health was impaired by
typhoid fever, In August recruits were

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith 14
paid a bounty of $25.00 each. Dr. William
Stump Forwood was named Regimental Surgeon.
The troops were on the Eastern Shore of Maryland
until transferred in mid-1862 to guard duty
along the Northern Central R.R., where head-
quarters were at Relay, Md. The papers show
routine matters of supply, discharges, trans-
portation, etc.

In October, 1862, the 2nd Eastern Shore Home
Guards were ordered by the Secretary of War
through Governor Augustus W. Bradford of

Maryland to transfer to “other regiments of

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith @—RebensaStizeti- 15
the State of an unconditional character," whose
service might be outside Maryland.

Bridadier General Henry HayesgLockwood,
commanding the lst Brigade, VIIIArmy Corps,
with headquarters at Drummondtown, Virginia,
issued a series of orders to the regiment be-
ginning in October, 1862. A mutiny broke out,
presumably about the change in the character
of service. By January 28, 1863, Robert Smith
Rodgers was colonel, Elijah E. Massey remaining
as lieutenant colonel, The regiment went into
winter quarters at Eastville, Virginia, where

 

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith 4<Robert=seragerr 16
they were on guard duty. Evidently discipline
was being tightened, as (general Lockwood
reprimanded strolling by soldiers in the town
and absence of officers from their companies.
Seizure of property for purposes other than
commissary, desertion, and enlistment of minors
also concerned General Lockwood,

 

From this point contrabands begin to cause
problems. In February, 1863, Rodgers receives
a report on whites and contraband Negroes

working at the Eastville post and hospital.

up a blockade of the northern bank of the
Potomac River. Colonel Rodgers and the 2nd
Eastern Shore move to Point Lookout, Maryland,
where an army post and Hammond General Hospital

General Lockwood, Illegal use of contraband
by members of the VIIICorps is forbidden by
General Order No. 5, April 6, 1863.

The problem of contrabands again is mentioned

 

on May 6, 1863, when Mrs. Abigail (Hopper)
Gibbons, in charge of nurses at Hammond General
Hospital, writes to express her indignation

at their treatment. She also comments on Drs.

is attached a statement of Dr. J. H. Miles in
regard to contrabands.

The 2nd Eastern Shore is ordered on June 21,
1863, to Relay House, Maryland, for guard
duty along the Northern Central R.R. during

 

 

the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 5 they move
to Frederick, Maryland, and by the 26th are on
guard duty at Maryland Heights across the
Potomac River from-Harper's Ferry. They remain
there for the winter, the orders and routine

papers revealing camp life. The orders of
General J.C. Sullivan concern depredations by
Union troops and speculation in hay, wheat, and
oats. Courts martial, reenlistment, and
muster rolls occupy the official papers, with
orders by Generals Henry W. Halleck, Edward
Townsend, and Max Weber. On April 27, 1863,
Colonel Rodgers is ordered on guard duty along
the Baltimore and Ohio R:Re By May the 2nd
Eastern Shore is in the Reserve Division of the
Department of West Virginia, when it receives
orders to march under General David Hunter up

the Shenandoah Valley. Orders now concern
conduct of troops. Hunter's General Order No.
34, June,1864, assigns special duties to vari-
ous divisions of his army. This section of the
papers concludes with Colonel Rodgers' report
of the 2nd Eastern Shore at the Battle of
Piedmont, June 5, 1864.

estate of Mrs. Minerva Rodgers.

The 1222 items and 7 vols. added, 10-25-65,
to the Robert Smith Rodgers Papers are rather
complete, but they are routine papers of the

2nd Regiment of Eastern Shore Maryland Infantry
Volunteers. This unit was commanded in turn

by Colonels Edward B. Wilkins, Elijah E.
Massey, and Robert Smith Rodgers. The latter,

 
Rodgers, Robert

with vossession
history of this
which is in the

of these records, wrote 4
regiment, the manuscript of
original papers. The story of

the 2nd E. S. Maryland Regiment is related

earlier in this

sketch.

The papers of the regiment comprising this
addition contain military correspondence,

a few telegrams, and general and special
orders which have been placed with the original

file of letters

and papers. The following

correspondents are present: Benjamin Lloyd

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith 24

 

Beall, Augustus Williamson Bradford, John
A. J. Creswell, George Hamilton Crosman, John
Adams Dix, William Hemsley Emory, Julius
Peter Garesche, Henry Hayes Lockwood, Edwin
MceMasters Stanton, William Denison Whipple,
John Ellis Wool, George Crook, James L.
Donaldson, Henry W. Halleck, and Robert
Cumming Schenck.

The regimental papers include the muster
rolls of Colonels Wilkins, Massey, and
Rodgers, together with rosters of commissioned

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith 25

 

officers, field officers, and non-commissioned
staff. Recruits, reenlistments, and voluntary
enlistments are noted, together with lists of
deserters, and court-martial charges and
specifications. Medical affairs are noted in
reports of sick and wounded, convalescents,
inventories of personal effects of deceased,
hospital and army paroles, etc. Final
statements and annual returns conclude this
box of papers.

Morning reports for the regiment are with

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith 26

 

Ordnance returns, invoices, requisitions,
issues, transfers, and miscellany. A group
of quartermaster papers includes records
relative to clothing, property, and stores.

A final box contains monthly and quarterly
returns 1861-1864, for the 2nd Eastern Shore
Maryland (A.G.0. Forms 38 and 40) and a
folder of quarterly returns of deceased
soldiers.

Among the volumes are two folders of
morning reports of the regiment in 1863 and

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith 27

 

1564. These have been placed in the papers
with other morning reports which are not
bound. There are also two volumes of bound
morning reports: one is dated May, 1863 -
Jan., 1864; the other begins with Colonel
(ee in Feb., 1862, and continues to May,
1863.

The letter book of Colonel Edward Wilkins
begins Jan. 2, 1862, and continues with the
other commanding officers till October ll,
1864. Its contents are routine military

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith

 

correspondence.

The order book of the 2nd Eastern Shore
Maryland Regiment begins in October, 1861,
when the troops were mustered into the army.
Copies of instructions for camp routine, of
appointments of various officers, courts-
martial sentences disciplining soldiers,

pronouncements on Negro affairs, marching
orders, and other routine military instructions
are contained in this volume from 1861 to

1865.

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith

 

The most interesting volume of this addition
dates ca. 1804. Its two parts are written by
the same hand, probably William Price, mate
of the Maria out of Baltimore, commanded by
Richard M. Smith.

The first half of the volume deals with
problems and examples of mathematical

computation which increase in difficulty until
they become navigational in character, exem-
plifying plane, transverse, and Mercator's
sailing. A handmade paper compass is attached

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith 30

 

to page 54. A navigational chart between
England and the Cape Verde Islands, pen
sketched and colored,is attached to page 87.
The early mathematical cases were evidently

of use in ship management and navigation.

On page 90 begins.a journal of a voyage from
London to Madeira in the Maria out of Baltimore,

This second part of the volume is a navigationa
logbook. (William C. Price is listed in the
General Navy Register as a master, 21 April
1809, and as "dismissed" onl March 1810.

 

 
Rodgers, Robert Smith 33

 

The commander of the Maria, Richard M. Smith
is connected in some way with the Rodgers or
the Perry families, both famous Maryland
seagoing groups. Robert Smith of Baltimore
was Thomas Jefferson's Secretary of the Navy
and a Maryland contemporary under whom
Captain John Rodgers served. Evidently Robert
Smith Rodgers was named for this Secretary of
the Navy by his father, Captain John Rodgers.

Rodney (1842-1927) served in the U. S. Army
over forty years retiring at his own request on
August 5, 1903, as Brigadier General. He en-
listed as a private in the Independent Company

of Pennsylvania Artillery, April 24, 1861. On
August 5, 1861, he was appointed from Delaware
as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 4th U. S. Artillery.
The same day he became a 1st Lieutenant. He
became Captain, March 4, 1869, Major, November
28, 1892, Lieutenant Colonel, February 13, 1899,

 

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927)

 

Colonel of the Artillery Corps, February 2,
1901, and Brigadier General, August 4, 1903.
He was active in the Civil War fighting in the
Battle of Stones River, Tennessee, December,
1862, and the Battle of Chickamauga, Georgia,
September, 1863. (Information comes from a

biographical sketch in Who Was Who in America.)

The collection consists of a Letter Book

 

(480 pp.) that is divided into two major parts:
the first part is the U. S. Army Artillery
School Letter Book, 1857-1861 (pp. 5-75); the

 

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927)

 

second part is the Company D, 4th Artillery
Letter Book, 1862-1878 (pp. 76-480). The U. S.
Artillery School was located in Fort Monroe,
Virginia. The main contributor to the Letter
Book was Major Harvey Brown (July 9, 1857 -
September 30, 1859, pp. 5-69). His entries are
followed by those from his successor J. Dimich.
His entries begin April 3, 1860, and end on
October 4, 1860 (pp. 69-72). The responsibility
for the majority of Letter Book entries for
Company D, 4th Artillery, was Rodney who was

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927) 4

 

company commander from 1869 to 1878 and whose
entries are on pages 121-466 of the Letter Book.
The first full entry for the Artillery School
is a letter from Fort Monroe, Va., July 9, 1857,
by Major Harvey Brown of the 2nd Artillery, who
was commander of the Artillery School of Practice
at Fort Monroe. Most of his entries concern his

persistent efforts to restore and improve the
Artillery School which had been started in the
1820s but had not been continued.

According to the Checklist of United States

 

 

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927) 5
Public Documents 1789-1909, p. 1310, the
Artillery School at Fort Monroe was established
by General Orders 99, November 13, 1867, though
for many years and extending back as far as 1823,
an artillery school had existed there "but in
name only." The Letter Book clearly illustrates
what a valiant effort Brown made to make the

 

 

school a reality as he struggled to overcome
money, administrative, curriculum, supply and
space concerns. Particularly interesting is his
view of different aspects of European military

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927) 6

 

education, his determined efforts to acquire an
adequate library for the school, his view of
what courses should be taught, inter-department-
al relations at Fort Monroe, his views on
staffing and organization at the school, and

his efforts to acquire adequate supplies for

testing artillery equipment.

The Letter Book for Company D, 4th Artillery,
begins on January 4, 1862. After the last
entries for 1878, they are reversed in the book.
These entries begin March 4, 1870, and end

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927)

 

September 11, 1873. There are several contribu-
tors to the Letter Book including contributions
by: F. M. Follett, January 4, 1862 to October
24, 1864 (pp. 76-118); A. B. Dyer, August 26,
1867 to October 3, 1867 (pp. 115-118); and H. B.
Ledyard, January 30, 1869 to April 5, 1869 (p.
119). Rodney's entries begin December, 1869,

and continue through February 1, 1878.
Rodney's letters are written from various

camps in the United States including: Fort

Monroe, Va. (1861-1862); Camp Hamilton, Va.

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927)

 

(1862); Fort Washington, Md. (1862); camp near
Gosport Navy Yard, Va. (1862); Camp Williams,
Norfolk, Va. (1862); Camp Suffolk, Va. (1863-
1864); Brownsville, Tex. (1865); Fort McHenry,
Md. (1867 - July 1870, Oct. 1870 - Aug. 1871);
Yanceyville, N.C. (July 1870 - Sept. 1870);
Raleigh, N.C. (1871 - Nov. 1872); Alcatraz Is-

land (1872; Sept. 1875 - July 1876); Sitka,
Alaska (1873 - July 1874); the Presidio of San
Francisco (Sept. 1874 - Aug. 1875); Fort Canby,
Washington Territory (July 1876 - Feb. 1878).

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927) 7
There is little specific information about these
camps and places.

Most letters from and to Company D are routine
covering such topics as: Promotion, demotion,
discharge, enlistment and reenlistment; requests
for blank forms; inventory and inspection re-
ports; requisitions for supplies; strengths and

 

weaknesses of particular soldiers; paperwork
foul-ups sometimes involving improper forms
having been used; and various types of quarterly
and monthly reports. The Letter Book provides

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927) ee 5's

 

an excellent insight into the large amount of
paperwork required to maintain company records
according to U. S. Army Regulations.

Very few references are made to the Civil War
although there are several letters from the
Civil War period.

Rodney was located in Yanceyville, N.C.,
from July until October, 1870, during the Kirk-
Holden War. He gives important information
about the conflict between the local civil
authorities, the local citizenry and the state

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927) it

 

authorities. He also sends questions about his
and his company's role in the conflict to his
superiors. Several letters written from his
superiors in Raleigh, N.C., during this period
attempt to answer his guestions. Ina letter
from Bvt. Col. R. J. Frank (July 26, 1870), he

is told when military action may be taken, but
Frank concludes "the U. S. troops should be used,
however, only when imperatively necessary and
when every other recourse shall have been ex-
hausted." (Information about the Kirk-Holden

 
Rodney, George Brydges (1842-1927) 12
War has been photocopied from the published work
The History of a Southern State North Carolina
by Hugh T. Lefler and Albert R. Newsome, pgs.
466-468, and is included with the collection.)
Other letters from Army headquarters (pp. 468-
480) clarify what the relationship should be
between civil and military authorities. They
illustrate well the restraint the military was
ordered to exercise during Reconstruction.

this collection are a miscellaneous group of
letters addressed to Rogers. They are generally
business letters, but one, dated Oct. 10, 1862,

is written by William W. Wright, Rogers's
nephew who was a captain in the 112th Regiment
of Illinois Volunteers (Infantry). Wright
discussed the movement of his regiment.

England. 9 items and 3 vols. Sketch.

This collection constains letters and a hand-
written journal of Hester Ann (Roe) Rogers (1756-
1794.) , wife of James Hogers, an early Methodist
preacher in England. The original manuscripts
belong to the Lamglough Collection, The Methodist
Church, London, England. There are nineteen
letters which Hester Rogers wrote to Sally Sal-
mon, a friendfbetween 1776 and 1785.

Fifteen of these letters (1776-1785) appear
as drafts in the third volume of the journal
(bp. 113-152), and four are original items. The
addresseesof three letters (1780-178) are

 

 
Rogers, Hester Ann 2

 

unknown, Among the separate items is a funeral
ode which James Rogers wrote after the death of
his wife in 1794. The content of these letters
involves the religious and personal life of the
correspondents.

The first volume (188 pp.) of the journal is
entitled A Short Account of Ye Experience of H
A R Written by Herself, Cork, August 30, 1789.
During pages 1-32 the author describes her early
religious development. On page thirty-two appears
the title, A Brief Extract from Ye Journal of
Hester Ann Roe - As Far As It Respects Her
Christian Experienceé. The pages which follow
this titlégontain regular entries for the period

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Rogers, Hester Ann 3

From July 30, 1775, to May 19, 1780, with the
exception of March 10, 1777, to June 6, 1779,
which is summarized (pp. 120-122). Thes@ accounts
relate Hester's daily life which she views and
records according to the religious concern which
seems to have been her dominant passion. Her
comments are often introspective, but the act-

 

ivities of her local Methodist group have a
prominent place in hse® discussion. She notes the
visits o: John Wesley in April, 1776 (p. 72),

and “arch, 1777 (p. 120) Miss Roe cites the top-
ics of Wesley's sermons and makes a few general
remarks about these meetings.

 
Rogers, Hester Ann
The second volume is entitled the Continuation
of Ye Jowrnal of HAR Written by Herself.
This volume hes entries from May 21, 1780, to
April 18, 1782. She writes about the visits of
John Wesley in March, 178} (pp. 92-9), and
March, 1782 (pp. 172-181), records the topics of
his sermons, and summarizes several of them. In

 

 

 

March, 1781, Miss Roe mentions (p. 91) her first
impressions of James Kogers who she eventually
marries in 1784. Rogers preached a circuit in
Cheshire, and Hester frequently mentitions him as
well as other local and itinerant Methodists.

 
Rogers, Hester Ann a

The third volume (199 pp.), Continuation of
H A R'S Journal, has entries from April 20,1760,
to October 21, 1784. Wesley visits and preaches
in April, May, and August, 1783 (pp. 63-64, 69,
86-88), and Hester consults him about her pro-
posed marriage (p. 97). Miss Roe knew Wesley p
personally and makes scattered references about
his activitiess This volume has copies of two
persmal letters that Wesley wrote to Miss Roe -
May 3, 1776, from Whitehaven, Eng. (pp. 61-62).
An incomplete copy (June 2, 1776, from Newcastle
upon tyne, Eng.) may be a third letter from
Wesley (p. 155). In Aug. 1783, Wesley intervenes
in a dispute in gs church which centers

around James Rogers, its preacher. Among other
Bn-8e to Wesley are those on pp. 61-62 and
After James Rogers marries Hester Roe, he and
his wife move to his new charge in Dublin, Irele
and the last part of this volume is dated from
there. Pp, 113-153 contain the drafts of letters
to Miss Salmon, and the last forty-four pages
are blank.

John H. Rogers lived in Baltimore, Maryland.

In a letter dated Jan. 17, 1816 (Annapolis,
Md.), Peter Little writes about the upcomin
congressional elections, Little (1775-1830
served as U.S. Congressman from Maryland during
1811-1813 and 1816-1829, Little says that he
has received several letters inquiring about his
running for Congress, but he is concerned that
the nomination process is being done unfairly.
He objects to selection by delegates sent from
the wards, feeling that the people and the county

 
 

committee shou id make the decision. He elabor-
ates further about the political situation in
Baltimore and Baltimore County, including
problems between the city and county and between
the merchants on one hand and the mechanics and
laborers on the other,

This collection consists of several notes and
two poems by Samuel Rogers (1763-1855), English
poet. Personal notes are addressed to Lady
Henrietta Georgiana Marcia Lascelles Chatterton,
British writer (ca. 1841; see watermark) and to
a Miss Fanshawe, probably Catherine Maria Fan-
shawe, the poetess (n. d.).

There are two poems which are signed and
dated by Rogers. On October 2, 1847, he ad-
dressed lines 27-37 of "Ginevra" to Lewis Jacob
Cist, a poet and autograph collector of Cincin-

consists of seven lines that begin, "No, 'tis
not here that Solitude is known."

1 item added, 8-7-71: This manuscript con-
tains extracts from several letters of William
Mason (1724-1797), the poet, that were pre-
served at Nuneham, the residence of Lord Har-

 

court. The extracts were copied by Samuel
Rogers in about 1842, the date that appears in
the watermark on the paper. Mason's letters to
Viscount Nuneham (Later Second Earl Harcourt)

of a personal and literary nature.

1 item added, 10-24-73: On Oct. 20, 1845,
Rogers wrote to Charles Mackay, the poet and
journalist, about a pension for Tennyson,
Tennyson's personality, past appeals for a

Sion Hart Rogers was a Reoresentative
from N. C. He was born near Raleigh in
Wake County, N. C., Sept. 30.\t*He obtained

his education in the common schools and at
the University of North Carolina, obtaining
his degree in 1846. He studied law, was
admitted to the bar in 1848, and began his

practice in Raleigh. He was elected as a

2 )

 
Rogers, Sion Hart Sketch (2)
Whig to the Thirt-third Congress but de-
clined to be a candidate for renomination
in 1854. Until the outbreak of the Civil
War he was solicitor of the Raleigh dis-
trict of the Superior court. During the
war he served in the Confederate Army as a
lieutenant in the 14th Regt. N. CG. State
Troops until April 8, 1862, at which time
he was commissioned a colonel in the 47th
N. ©. Infantry. He resigned Jan. 5, 1863,
upon being elected Attorney General of the

state of N. C., in which canacity he ser-

 

 
Rogers, Sion Hart Sketch (3)
ved until 1866. He was an unsuccessful
candidate for election to the Forty-first
Congress, but wag elected as a Democrat to
the Forty-second. He ran again unsuccess-
fully in 1872. He died Aug. 14, 1874, in
Raleigh. (From Biographical Directory of
the American Congress. )

 

 

 

In view of his rather colorful career,

he set opens @ with a group of

 
Rogers, Sion Hart Sketch (4)

letters from former school mates to Jane
E. Haywood (usually addressed as Jennie

or Jinks) who married Rogers in March of
1853.

 

There follows considerable correspon-
dence between Rogers tn Washington and

his wife in Raleigh during the time that
he was finishing up his term as Represen-
tative in 1854. Excent for a short period

in which she stayed in Washington with him,
the corresnondence ig fairly regular. Un-

 
Rorers, Sion Hart Sketch (5)
fortunately, he did not write of Congres-
Sional activities, but only of personal
matters of health, finance, etc. There

are only two political allusions in the en-
tire group, and both of these appear in
Jennie's letters. In the -letters of Mar.

8 and May 1, 1854, she mentions respectively
the tedious progress of the Kansas-Nebraska
Act through Congress, and a speech which
Rogers has made which will undoubtedly be

attacked by the Log-Foco party.

 

 
Rogers, Sion Hart Sketch (6)

The Civil War letters begin June 8,
1861, with several good descriptions of
camp life. Rogers was at this time sta-
tioned near Suffolk, Va., guarding the
Shores of the James River. After he was
made a colonel in 1862, however, he seems
have operated alternately in Virginia and
the Eastern coast of North Carolina. Ina
letter dated June 18, 1861, he gives a
fairly good description of an offteer's

course of training.

vert to purely personal accounts.

Rolinson, Robert. Account Book, 1849-1878.
Hatteras, Dare County, North Carolina

 

This volume is identified with Robert Rolin-
son since many of the accounts and receipts are
made out to him. He was variously a merchant,
windmill owner, light-ship keeper, fisherman,
and justice of the peace for Hyde County (the

latter is noted, 1858, on page 116). The fami-
ly names suggest residence in the Hatteras com-
munity on the Outer Banks. The 1850 census of
Hyde County lists a Robert Rolinson (last name

 
Rolinson, Robert 2

 

misspelled), a seaman aged 32, in the Cape Hat-
teras Banks District. In 1870 Hatteras Island
became part of Dare County that was established
in that year. The 1870 census for Dare County
lists Robert Rolinson, a fisherman aged 52, for
Hatteras Township. This census also lists
preceding Rolinson's family a Magor or Major

Whidbee whose name appears often in the later
accounts of this volume. Thus, Rolinson lived
either in the village of Hatteras or in its

vicinity.

 
Rolinson, Robert B Tie
For some years Rolinson, referred to often as
Captain Rolinson, was keeper of the Long Shoal
Light Vessel off the east point of Long Shoal
in what is now Dare County. The accounts for
his work with the light ship are usually signed
receipts for the salaries of men who performed
unspecified services for the vessel, 1859-1861.

 

A receipt for supplies appears as early as 1855
(p. 116). Long Shoal Light Vessel was built in
1825 and was refitted in 1854. Details about it
are in U. S, Light House Board, List of Light-

Houses, Lighted Beacons, and Floating Lights of
the United States (Washington, 1859), pp. 48-49,
The mercantile entries extend from 1849 into
the 1870's but they do not indicate an extensive
business,
An indenture appears on page 114 for the sale
of Rolinson's windmill in 1875. Such mills
were used in the county for grinding corn.
Branson's North Carolina Business Directory for
1869 lists a Robert Robinson, probably a mis-
spelling of Rolinson, as owner of a windmill at

Hatteras (p. 80),

Very little is known about Leighton Rollins
other than that he was a friend of John Hall
Wheelock and that he lectured on drama ancient
and modern, gave poetical readings, and pro-

duced plays. He was born in Wellesley, Massa-
chusetts, and his father was a lawyer. He re-
ceived his flair for the dramatic by watching
and studying his father in the courtroom and
listening to him read aloud the Odyssey, and

 
Rollins, Leighton 2

the Iliad, and many heroic dramas. When Leigh-
ton decided to make drama his career, he went
to California where he was the director of a
theater school and a public lecturer.

Rollins liked Wheelock's poetry and read his
poems in many public appearances. The letters

 

from Wheelock which make up this collection
discuss Wheelock's pleasure at Rollins' readings
and the publicity he was giving Wheelock's
poems. In one letter Wheelock, himself a pub-
lic reader, listed a number of his poems that

 
Rollins, Leighton

 

read well in public readings.

Among Rollins' writings is a freely adapted
version of Euripides' Hippolytus (1948). In
the Preface Hugh Kenner states, "Very few peopl4¢
understand what actors and stage managers can
do, what audiences can follow, so thoroughly
as he [Leighton Rollins] does."

appointed clerk of the State Supreme Court, and
later became Judge of the Criminal Court of New

Graham's Cross Roads, S. C.

 

 

Eugenia (Ronan) Carew, wife of Hamilton Carew
of Charleston, 5S. C., writes to her family in the
first half of 1865. The Ronans, Sister Harriett
Frances Ronan and her mother, are at Graham's
Cress Roads, S. C., and communtcation between tl

two families is difficult in early 1865.

The first letter to Mrs. Ronan reveals the
uncertainty of civilians as the war closes in
on South Carolina. Mr. Carew has not yet

received his summons[ to military duty?] and

 
Ronan, Harriett Frances . Sete
"folks here" talk of going to Dr. Davidson'’s
near Charlotte, N. C. Mrs. Carew has succeeded
in borrowing money to pay the taxes on her
mother's house on Amherst Street and on her
father's farm, both of which she hopes to rent.
Hamilton Carew, James Mazyck, and one
Cannon of Bonneaux, having presumably been cap-

 

tured in military service, are brought into

Charleston to jail. They are to be sent to

Hilton Head to take the oath and be exchanged.
The letters contain much family gossip. 01d

Dr. Ravenel is mentioned. Mrs. Carew's mother

 
Ronan, Harriett Frances

 

and grandmother are both alive. Lack of money
and food, rationing, illness, and prices concern
Mrs. Carew. By June 21, Hamilton Carew is home
again.

James Mazyck. was a descendent of the great
Charleston merchant, Isaac Mazyck, a French
Huguenot. James was also related to William
Gaillard Mazyck (b. 1846), who married Henrietta
Vallee Ronan in 1869.

Miss Ethel Mazyck of Charleston, the former
owner of these letters, identified the prisoners

mentioned in them and the correspondents.

Henry Rood (1867-1954) was prominent in th
field of journalism, having been a newspaper
correspondent, author, and assistant editor of
Harper's Magazine. Most of his papers in this
collection are concerned with his work in jour-

 

nalism; however some letters bear particular
mention, An invitation, dated April 10, 1907,
to attend a memorial performance of "Ben Hur"
and choral service commemorative of the eight-
ieth birthday of Ganeral Lewis Wallace is one
such importance. In eo" received Oct. 6,

1908, from Admiral Peary, comments are made re-
lative to the explorations of Frederick Albert
Cook in the Aretie region. There is a photo-
print of a telegram sent to Henry Rood by Ad-
miral Peary on Sept. 6, 1909, announcing the
discovery of the North Pole. That Rood dis-

 

played an interest in military affairs is re-
vealed in his letters and correspondence with
prominent military men. One such letter is
dated Dec, 14, 1926, from General John J.
Pershing in which a statement is given on pre-
paredness. Some “@ of the personal life

guard to President Lincoln, are found in letters
written to Henry Rood. A letter dated Aug. 19,

Actors Fund of America, mentions the following:
actress Maude Adams, actor Edward H. Sothern,

 

producer Charles H. Hoyt, 01d Lyceum Theater,
Madison Square Theater and the Bijou Theater.
