There are, in addition, a few Civil War letters from the Pope side of the     collection. Three of Lesey Jane Pope's sons were in the Confederate Army and infrequently wrote letters to her.

In 1840 the academy is rented to William Collins and other persons, and Collins becomes a trustee (pages 72-78). Indirectly involved in this transaction and in the subsequent operation of the academy is Captain Alden     Partridge, prominent military educator. Par- tridge and his students are credited with the establishment of a number of military academies, among them one at Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1839 (see the biographical sketch of Partridge in"

There are many cash entries for John Fleming and Caleb S. Prescott during 1837-1838, and they are  apparently the joint proprietors. The spelling of Prescott's name is taken from these accounts and from the back cover of the volume. John Fleming's name also appears on the back cover."

The Daybook & Ledger, 1837-1842, has two     parts. The first 43 pages are the Ledger, 1837- 1838.

There are four additional pages of entries at the end of the volume.
