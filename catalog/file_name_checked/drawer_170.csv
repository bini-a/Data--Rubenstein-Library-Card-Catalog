Clemens also entertained an idea of writing a biography of Santayana who sternly resists the proposal (June 30, Aug. 11, 1946; July 17, Nov. 12, 1948; Jan. 21, Feb. 21, Apr.9,  Nov. 22, 1949)."

Because of the outbreaks of disease, Russell did not go on to California in 1849 or 1850, but in 1850 he went with five other men from Independence, Mo., to Salt Lake City with the U. S. mail. Among the things that impressed him most on this trip were the numerous graves     of emigrants along the trail which was a por- tion of the Oregon Trail. The Mormons treated them well but charged high prices for commod- ities. As on one of his earlier journeys, the mules were run off by Indians and he and his companions were forced to complete their trip on foot. @"
