He was mustered into Company D of the 8th Indiana Infantry Regi- ment on April 21, 1861, as a private. His origi- nal term of enlistment was for only three months,  so he was mustered out on August 6, 1861, when his term expired. Later he was mustered into the 84th Indiana Infantry Regiment, Company D as a sergeant. His term of service was from August 13 1862, to June 14, 1865. This information is con-"

Sarah or ""Sallie"" (Watts) Fifer was his wife's name, and they had at least two sons.

Fifer was mainly stationed in Tennessee when he wrote these letters, which contain much of a routine and personal nature. Several of the letters, though, do give some brief details about the movements and activities of the 84th Indiana Volunteers. The regiment is not identified in his letters, but the 84th is the unit with which he served during that period. Fifer noted in a letter of April 26, 1863, that he had been de-"

Although the Fravel family was promi- nent at Woodstock and in Shenandoah County,  biographical information about Joseph Fravel is lacking.

Joseph Fravel was originally in partnership with David Fravel, probably his brother (see notation opposite page 1), whose interest in tir business he purchased in 1881. An inventory of this partnership at its dissolution on April 13, 1881, is listed on pages 48-54. Early accounts are for the partnership, but most of the volume concerns Joseph Fravel alone. His name occasionally appears in the accounts, as on pages 89 and 351. Accounts are abundant for the 1880's and 1890's, and the prices of the company's products appear in them."
