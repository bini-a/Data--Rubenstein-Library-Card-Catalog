"Dow, Neal","Dow, Neal. Papers. Portland, Cumberland Co., Me,     Neal Dow was born in 1804 in Portland, Maine where he eventually became a partner in his father's tanning business. After establishing himself as one of the city's leading business- men, he entered politics and was elected mayor.  During his incumbency, he conducted a vigorous campaign to restrict the sale and use of alco- holic beverages. He was instrumental in the  passage of the “Maine Law,"" legislation de- signed to facilitate temperance reform. Dow"
"Dow, Neal","Dow, Neal 2 became one of the nation's leading prohibition- ists. He also served as a brigadier general  of volunteers in the Union Army, though he was dismissed from the Society of Friends for his military involvement. After the Civil War, he resumed his crusade for temperance reform and in 1880 ran for the Presidency as the candidate     of the Prohibition Party. He continued as an active reformer until his death in 1897.  In a letter of March 13, 1896, Dow cites the ""Maine Law"" as a ""great power for good"" and one"

"Downes, Edward","Downes, Edward. Papers, 1775-1784. Queen Annes County, Maryland     Edward Downes was a planter and prominent citizen of Queen Annes County, Maryland. Since hewas a vestryman of St. Paul's Parish, he probably lived within the vicinity of the church, then Old Chester Church that was located off the road between Centreville and Queenstown. He farmed, owned several plantations some of which were rented, and apparently operated a store. There are a number of references to"
"Downes, Edward","Downes, Edward     him in Frederic Emory's Queen Anne's County, Maryland, Its Early History and Development (Baltimore, 1950). These references indicate that he was a student at Queen Annes Free School (1725); a private in the Queen Annes Company of minutemen commanded by Capt. James        Kent that fought against Lord Dunmore in Virginia in 1776; vestryman of St. Paul's (1780); register of Queen Annes County School (1781); a justice of the Orphan's Court (1782); and a trustee of the poor (1794)."
"Downes, Edward","Downes, Edward     Ledger A, 1775-1783 (90ff.), is a fine, detailed accounting of his personal, family, and business expenses during those years. This volume is not labeled with his name, but loose sheets of accounts found within it identify it as his. One sheet is Coursey Wright's account with Edward Downes, and transactions listed in  it also are entered in Coursey's account in the ledger (f. 85). Because many accounts are noted as continued in ""Liber B,"" this volume must be Ledger A. There is no index for this ledger."
"Downes, Edward","Downes, Edward 4 Downes' early work as a storekeeper and book- keeper noted in entries on f. 4 suggest that he was trained as a mercantile clerk. Clerks of that period were trained in fine handwriting, and his ledger is finely written as well as being an example of careful, detailed accounts. Farming was Downes' principal financial     interest, and corn, wheat, oats, and beans were the main crops. There are also numerous entries for tobacco. The value of these crops and"

Entries for the purchase of goods from a general store pervade the accounts with many persons, a good indication that Downes operated the store.
