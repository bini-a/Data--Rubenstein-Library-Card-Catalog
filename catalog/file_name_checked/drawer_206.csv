Th’ January 1776 Battaile Muse established headquarters in Berkely County Va., to serve as manager for tk estates of James and John Francis Mercer. Muse and the Mercers Maintained connections at least untill 1783, James Mercer wrote many letters to Muse, usually  about details of planting and the treatment of Slaves, In his letters Mercer often urged that the overseers be required to treat the slaves humanely.

His lette were written from his home in Fredericksburg, Va., and were, usually concerned with agricult- ural problems, including the prices of various Commodities. Mercer's correspondence with Muse, the most extensive of the collection, continued from 1776 until 1783. Numerous letters of the same nature were also written to Muse by John Francis Mercer, brother of James. The estate  of the Mercers was located chiefly in Fauquier  County."

Apparently Muse's connection with Hugh Nelson, judging by the letters of this collection, end- ured for two years, 1778-1779. There are a number of Nelson's letters in the collection  which usually concern the sale of farm products.

Lord Thomas Fairfax died in 1781 and George William Fatrfax     in 1787, In 1792 Muse was given even greater power of conduct over the Fairfax estate by Wilson Miles Cary, the executor of the estate and therof Sally (Cary) Fairfax,who was the widow of George William Fairfax.

They were married at Dunedin, the Muse estate on the outskirts of Petersburg, and they subsequently had five children. When Muse quit the diplomatic service and with his     family returned to Dunedin in 1934, he began to devote much effort to the estate and as time went on it became something of an experimental  farm.

On Septe ber 8, 1936, he publicly stated that he would not vote for F. D.

"Muse, Benjamin","Muse, Benjamin 16 After his resignation in 1936, Muse became increasingly close to the Virginia Republican Party and gradually began to count some of his best friends there. In 1938, Muse made speeches for Fred McWane, Republican candidate for Con- gress from the fourth district, who under the circumstances ran a good race but was defeated.     Muse's efforts were directed toward persuading anti-New Deal Democrats to vote Republican. All during 1938 and 1939, he worked with the Virginia  Republican hierarchy attempting to build up the"

But he did not become fully committed to the party unti late 1939, when he moved to establish a paper, The Republican Survey, which would ""report the activities of the Republicans throughout the State and seek to create a new sense of unity and dignity among them"" (Letter: 1939, Octo-     ber 31). Similar to a newsletter, it would not engage in propaganda. The first issue came out in December, 1939, and Muse continued to publish  it until its demise at the end of 1940,"

One is a brief account pub lished in the Durham Morning Herald; a second in a brief pamphlet; and the third is a typescript.

It is very probable that he descended from Martin Nalle who married in 1783 and was the father of William, Martin, Ann, Rachel, Winnie, Clary and Millie. Thomas B. Nalle's parents were Jesse Nalle and Ann (Botts) Nalle. Thomas B. Nalle's children were William (Adjutant General of Virginia), Valeria, Thomas, Adrian, Leonidas, and Orville.

The terror of the people, the des- truction of property, and the crowded hospitals are well described.
