He engaged in farming near Ogdensburg, St. Lawrence County, and was associated with the mining industry. During 1841-1843 he was a member of Congress. At the outbreak of the Civil War he reentered the army and was chief of staff under Winfield Scott. From 1862 to 1864 he was inspector gen- eral with the rank of colonel."

A receipt of Dec. 24, 1847, tallies with the amount owed by Samuel Getty in his account as of that date (p. 135). The receipt is signed either by or in behalf of H.

The register enrolls the Negroes by name, age, stature, complexion, and where and by whom     emancipated. It is interesting that the early  entries are for slaves freed 1782 to 1796 by the Quakers.
