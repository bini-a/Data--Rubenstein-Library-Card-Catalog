"Bradbury, Samuel","Bradbury, Samuel. Papers. Connecticut     Samuel Bradbury was a resident of Connecticut and a close friend of Andrew Jackson Crossley, by whom thirteen of these letters were written.  Crossley served in Company C of the battalion of U. S. Engineers attached to the Army of the Potomac.

At times those duties included fighting, and Crossley recounts what he saw and heard about the battles of the Wilderness, Spottsylva- nia, and Cold Harbor, as well as the Seige of Petersburg.  Crossley detested army life, and his letters     are filled with the wry observations of a common soldier. He regarded officers as pretended aristocrats and in one letter (April 10, 1864)  tells of a row between the troops and the offi-"

His letters also suggest the soldiers' grudging respect for Grant-and their affection for McClellan. Crossley writes about the problem of morale among the troops, complains about the large numbers of stragglers during battles, and mentions the bounties offered to induce men to reenlist. In a letter of July 15, 1864, he expresses his dislike of Negro troops in the  Union Army."
"Bradbury, Samuel","Bradbury, Samuel 4 There are several references to life in camp, especially to the plays and musical shows that were presented by itinerant troupes. Crossley also tells about some courts-martial and a few executions that resulted. For his descriptions of the work of the U. S. Engineers and his perceptive observations on army life, this     collection, though small, is very useful. The other letters are entirely personal. There is no significant biographical information  available for either Crossley or Bradbury."
