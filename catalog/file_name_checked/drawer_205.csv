McCabe placed Corse’s, Terry's, George H. Steuart's, Ransom's and Wallace's brigades in the Confederate line with     Munford guarding the left. His picture of the crumbling of this line is very clear. On Oct. 4, 1905, NcCabe wrote to Munford on the fate of R. E. Lee's papers.  Col. J. Risque HutYer of the llth Va.

Desire to prevent Gontroversy with friends of Fitz Lee and to protect Mrs. Fitz Lee from hurt was the basis of much of the talk against publication.
