Those business papers of this partnership that are at Duke are in the John Cook Rives collection since Rives was the           financial manager of the newspaper partnership from 1833 until it was dissotved in 1849.

"Blair, Francis Preston","Blair, Francis Preston, ‘(1791-1876) 2  In a letter of Aug. 8, 1531, Benjamin F. Linton stated that James Ray of Kentucky remained a steadfast Jacksonian.  W.H. Hardwick of Virginia wrote Blair that he was a loyal Unionist and expressed his support for William C. Rives (July 6, 1833). Im a letter dated Feb. 18, 1835, R.C. Hancock of Manchester, Tenn., informed Blair that Tennessee Democrats favored Hugh Lawson White to succeed Jackson but would also give their support to Van Buren should he be selected as the party's nominee."
"Blair, Francis Preston","Blair, Francis Preston, von 5 George G. Skipwith of Columbia, Tenn., wrote Blair that his group supported Jackson, but not Van Buren (Feb. 2, 1841).  In a letter dated Nov. 17, 1837, J.W. McKee of Chesterville, S.C., stated that contrary to the remarks of the northern newspapers, the majority of the people in South Carolina was  aligned with Calhoun. It was McKee’s opinion that William Kennedy Clowney, Congressman from S.C., did not realize this situation and would have difficulties in the next election."

Sir John Bowring (1792-1872) held adminis- trative office in the British government, was a member of the House of Commons, and served as a consul and diplomat in China. This correspon- dence primarily concerns his career in China from 1850 to 1857, but it also contains reflec- tions on his earlier political career as well as comment on contemporary politics in England. Bowring's letters are usually addressed to either Edgar Alfred or Frederick Hermann Bow- ring, two of his sons, and other members of the"

Sir John begins his consular duties at Canton in 1849, and comments on his life there appear in letters from 1850.

In January, 1851, Sir John reports the tor- ture ané murder of a British subject at Amoy by the Chinese civil authprities. Relations with the Chinese are unlikely to improve. The prime minister and another high official have"

He contends that Elgin's instructions from Lon-     don were an attempt to conciliate Cobden and the Radicals. However, Bowring is gratified that Lord Elgin deems it necessary to départ from these instructions and to pursue a course that more nearly agrees with his view of the situa-"

In three letters of March, May, and July, 1857, Frederick Bowring writes to his father about attitudes in Britain toward the war. He reports strong opposition, especially from Cobden and his political al-     lies. Lord Palmerston has sustained Bowring, called for an election, and returned to power in a stronger position.

Frederick has doubts about his father's role in the outbreak of the conflict, and he is anxious for clari- fication of discrepancies in Sir John's dis- patches to Parkes and Yeh.
