His mother and father, Florilla and Uriah Hanks, had a large family to whom Hanks refers frequently, some of his male relatives having also enlisted in the Union  Army.

In 1936, he brought out a well-crafted novel, The Foxes (Boston:Houghton Mifflin), which made some best-seller lists. The novel is about fox- hunting in the South, with much stress on the foxes' viewpoint. According to Saturday Review (July 18, 1936), the story consists of ""a saga of foxes wherein are chronicled the vivid lives and brave deaths of a fox family.""""
