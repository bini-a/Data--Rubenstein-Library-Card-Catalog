The prints were made and mounted between 1872, the date of the last pictures and the year when Yellowstone became a nation- al park, and 1879 when Jackson moved from Washington, D.C., to Denver, Colorado.

The boards of the 1871 pic- tures have a slick, glossy finish, white on back and dull yellow on front. The boards of the 1872 pictures have a dull, faded manila     appearance. The printing on the 1872 pictures features the name of the Survey and Hayden as well as Jackson. Perhaps the government issued the 1872 pictures. The printing for both years was in gold."

As the war progressed, Johnson became more convinced that government bungling was hurting the Confederate cause. By the middle of 1862 he thought the war was lost. On Sept. 8 he wrote to Stephens that the Union would soon have an army of 600,000. The South could not withstand an attack by such numbers. A month later he told a friend, ""I pray for suc- cess, I hope for success; but I do not expect"

On Jan. 3, 1863 he accept ed an appointment to the Confederate Senate. He served in that body until the end of the war.

John- son was critical of Stephen's efforts to have Davis removed from office. Early in 1863 Stephen, who was then in Ga., wrote Johnson several letters condemning the conduct of the government. In his replies Johnson invariably     urged Stephens to come to Richmond to help guide government business along more satisfact ory lines. When Stephens did not follow his advice, Johnson became incensed. On March 10, 1864 he wrote to Stephens, ""I can not sympath-"

I feel in my heart that it is unwise and wrong and lead to the most deplorable results.""  As hope for Confederate success grew dim- mer, Johnson became more determined that his government continue the fight. For a few Wee     s in the summer of 1864 Johnson and Stephens corresponded optimistically about the chance of obtaining a negotiated peace if Northern Democrats won the Presidency of the Union, but such hopes proved to be short-lived. In Oct."
"Johnson, Herschel Vespasian","Johnson, Herschel Vespasian 23 Johnson learned that Northern Demovrats would make peace only upon the condition that the Union be restored. This condition was unaccep table to Johnson. On Oct. 9 he urged Stephens to abandon thoughts of negotiating with the Union and direct his effort toward mounting a final offensive.     There is a gap in Johnson's correspondence extending from Oct. 1864 to Dec. 1865. During this period the war ended and reconstruction was begun. In the first letter written in the post-war period (Dec. 23, 1865) Stephens asked"
