These letters were written after Conrad left the sea ca. 1894 for literature. We find him  writing from a number of domiciles, mostly in Kent Co., England.

Accounts of various per- sonal and family illnesses likewise intrude into the Conrad epistolography. On Apr. 5, 190k, he wrote that half the time he felt on the verge of insanity. His wife, Jessie (George) Conrad,  wrote on Feb. 6, 1910, that he had had a com= plete nervous breakdown, Nevertheless, what- ever his shortcomings may have been, the over- all impression conveyed by the collection is that Conrad was an admirable gentleman."
"Conrad, Joseph","Conrad, Joseph     Conrad had almost a mania for destroying personal letters and very few were found among his papers after his death. See Jerry Allen, The Thunder and the Sunshine: A Biography of Joseph Conrad (1958), pp. 231-232.  The 31 items originally in the collection        are mainly letters (1897-1922) from Conrad to the publisher T.

"Cooper, John Snider","Cooper, John Snider Z Cooper was a well-educated man, and his  diary presents a balanced view of the war. He opposed slavery and secession, and he wanted the war to end in victory for his army. He was also a mild man, however, and did not wish to embitter the southerners further through unnecessary destruction or intemperate revenge.     It is unfortunate that this diary is more a calendar of events than a commentary written by a man apparently both sensitive and observant  when he wanted to be."
