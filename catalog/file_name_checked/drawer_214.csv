The next largest groups include Returns of Seamen and Im- port Custom papers, and the other items are in much smaller proportions.  Several interesting observations arise from a study of this collection. One of these concerns the chief items of export from Savannah during the years of this set. The one item which composed the largest part  of the export trade was up-land, or short-"
Savannah Port,"Savannah Port Paners Sketch (6) Staple cofton. Most of this went to Liver- pool, and the return cargoes consisted large- ly of tron, steel, and manufactured goods. There was some Sea Island Cotton to export, but not nearly so much of it as of the up- land. Two or three manifests, one in 1851, show that often ships came down from Boston     and New England with cargoes of ice. The 1851 manifest shows a cargo of 124 tons of ice from BostoOn“toiSavamneh. Most of the other cargoes from New England consisted  mainly of food."
Savannah Port,"Savannah Port Papers Sketch (7)  Two other items occur often in the ex port manifests from Savannah. One is rice. This commodity formed a part of many car- boes, and quite a few times was the whole cargo. The other item was lumber, notably pine, in the form of boards and shingles. Much of this went to Liverpool, and much of it to Barbados, Havana, and other island ports, but, interestingly enough, a consid- erable quantity was sent North to New England ports.  Much wine was imported from Madeira and"

Scarborough Family,"Scarborough Family. Papers. Mount Gilead, Montgomery County, North Carolina     The Scarboroughs were a family of farmers of Mount Gilead, Montgomery County, North Carolina. A series of men from the family held the job of postmaster at Mount Gilead  off and on for a large portion of the years from the establishment of the post office in 1835 to the beginning of the Wilson Administra- tion in 1913. From the 1880's down to 1913, the postmaster at Mount Gilead tended to be a Scarborough whenever the Republicans were in"

The town's first postmas- ter was Samuel Scarborough, to whom many of  the letters in the collection are addressed,  and he served from 1835 to 1850. He was the son of William Scarborough, who settled in the  area in 1792. In 1882, John R. Scarborough was     appointed postmaster and held the position until 1885. He was returned for the period 1889-1893. With the inauguration of McKinley in 1897, Henry T.

The Scarboroughs appear to have been fairly prominent members of their small community. John R.

Some of the collection' s legal papers from the 1870's to the 1890's reveal that H. M. Scarborough was a Justice of the Peace during this period. In addition, several of the vols."

There are relatively few letters or copies of letters written by members of the immediate family, unless they happened to be away from home for a time.  The vast majority of the letters are from friends and relatives addressed to the family  at Mount Gilead.  In many of the letters from the 1830's through the 1880's, one can see clear evidence of the westward movement of American agricul- ture. Many of the Scarboroughs' relatives and friends moved from North Carolina to such"

In the  1870's and 1880's, there are letters from people who moved to the frontier areas of that period such as Texas and Kansas.     The correspondence is probably most valuable for its portrayal of the lives of Southern farmers from the 1830's to the end of the cen=- tury.

Accounts of religious events, such as revivals, and expressions of religious opinions are plentiful.

An additional advantage of these letters is that"

Aside from the information: on farming and"
Scarborough Family,"Scarborough Family 9 the frontier, the nineteenth-century correspon- dence also sheds light on certain special aspects of the period. There is one letter (1847, April 10) from a North Carolina volunteer in the American Army in the Mexican War which contains a description of his impressions of     Mexico, although he does not seem to have been in the fighting. The correspondence from the Civil War period is abundant. There are many letters from Confederate soldiers, mainly from Franklin Scarborough, a private in the 44th North Carolina Regiment. His letters contain"
Scarborough Family,"Scarborough Family 10 much information on camp life, although due  to a heart condition and an eye ailment he  was not in any battles. The other side of the Civil War in the South--the home front--is presented rather well in the letters from home written to Frank and in the letters sent to     Mount Gilead from other parts of the South.  In addition, the correspondence prior to 1900 includes several letters, some of which are excellent, from students at various colleges, especially Davenport Female College in Lenoir, North Carolina, and Davidson College,"
Scarborough Family,"Scarborough Family 11 North Carolina.  The twentieth-century correspondence concen- trates on the period 1914 to 1933 and concerns for the most part family gossip, minor business matters, and genealogy of the Scarborough family. The writers of letters from this     period are in most cases residents of North Carolina. The most interesting portion of  the twentieth-century letters are those written during the latter part of World War I to‘ Sam  P. Scarborough, a private in the 55th Pioneer Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army, by his"
Scarborough Family,"Scarborough Family 12 family and friends. These letters reveal much about the civilian view of the war and the demobilization. Unfortunately no significant letters home from Sam are contained in the collection. In the early 1920's, there are several good letters from J. B. Scarborough,     who received a Ph.D. in mathematics from Johns Hopkins and went on to become a professor at the U. S. Navel Academy. His letters usuall include observations on national politics and on life at the Academy.  The fairly abundant set of legal papers con-"
Scarborough Family,"Scarborough Family 13 sists of many deeds and summonses, and some wills, land grants, reports on local election results, sheriff's reports to the state treas- urer on tax collections, and inventories of estates. The legal papers deal almost exclu- sively with affairs in Montgomery County, North     Carolina, and are centered on the nineteenth century, although some extend backward into the late eighteenth and forward into the early twentieth centuries.  The financial papers cover the period 1760- 1917 and are mainly bills and receipts having"

The small amount of printed material includes some Republican campaign material from the 1920's and 1932, and several programs, such     as one for a national postmaster’ s convention in 1932.

Francis Schnadhorst (1840-1900) was a pro- minent political organizer in the British Lib- eral Party. In 1873 he became secretary of the Birmingham Liberal Association, and four years later he was secretary to the National Liberal  Federation that he helped to establish. This central organization of the party was an impor- tant factor in its political life. - Before Schnadhorst retired in 1893, he served as chief organizer and adviser of the party, 1885-1892."
