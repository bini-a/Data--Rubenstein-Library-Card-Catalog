A notable pub- lisher was Prang that issued many sets during 1862-1869 in a 2 1/2 x 4 inch format. Most cards do not contain the Prang name, having only picture and title. Sizes may be somewhat  larger up to about 11 x 14 in., but many will be under 7 inches. See also the Mary J. Horton Papers in the Manuscript Department. Mary J.

The principal use was to embellish the old scrap albums of the 1880's by filling in the odd spaces between cards. Some were sold in packets especially put up for making home-made valen-        tines and other greeting items. Small sizes came in sheets held together by small tabs. Larger ones were often very intricate designs up to a foot long. There were many sets and series. This information is from J. R. Burdick

The conclusion of the sermon deals with the sin of slavery and the freedom of     Negroes, the burden of slavery to masters, and the duties of slaves to those masters.

Catholic Church,"Catnolic Unurcn. « Papers, 1653. Vatican City     This Latin manuscript gives the views of Sir Dr. Hennebel on the idea of grace during the Jansenist controversy.  A brief glance at the historical background of this controversy may be helpful at this point Cornelis Jansen (1585-1639)--Cornelius Jansenius  --was a Dutch theologian who served as a pro-  fessor of exegesis at the University of Louvain and later as Bishop of Ypres. The controversy, occasioned by the posthumous publication of his  ="

The Jansenists -mostly in France--upheld these five doctrines: total depravity, irresistible grace, loss of fred will, predestination, and limited atonement.  The general subject of the manuscript, is     grace in the theological sense, and what God's grace does, as against what man's works might do, grace as a ground of salvation, and grace achieved by following God*s command."
Catholic Church,"Catnolic vnurca 3 Five points of the text in summary form are: 1. Against the first proposition--I do not believe that any of God's precepts is impossible 2. Against the second proposition--I affirm the reality of two kinds of grace, efficient and sufficient. 3. Against the third proposition--It is nec- essary that man have freedom of choice in order     to achieve merit (or lose it).  4, Against the fourth proposition--the idea that human will can modify previous grace is not semi-pelagian or heretical but right and orthodox  dox."
Catholic Church,Catholic vhurca 4     5. Against the fifth proposition--it is not semi-Pelagian but Catholic to say that Jesus died for everyone.  Evidently what the writer is against is not  the five propositions but the alleged grounds for condemning them.
