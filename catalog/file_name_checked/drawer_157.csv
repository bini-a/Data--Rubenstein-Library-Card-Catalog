Acker accepted the as signment, and, posing as a deserter, mage his wa  to Spanish Fort.

He met John Wilkes, the noted radical politi- cian, in 1761 and became his friend for life. He supported the opposition to the government     and wrote or edited a number of books and pamphlets, some of which can be found in the catalog of this library.

The latter were occasionally written on letters received from Calcraft. Most of the correspondence is from 1771 and 1772.     John Calcraft(1726-1772) was the son of a politician at Grantham. He obtained a civil office in London through the Marquis of Granby, but his rise to prominence and wealth was under the patronage of Henry Fox, First Lord Holland."

Five years later he reconciled Chatham and Lord Temple. His parliamentary career included seats from Calne, 1766-1768,  and from Rochester, 1768-1772, the latter year being the date of his death.

On Oct. 1 Almon reported that Nash and Sawbridge won the poll, and the aldermen would probably select Nash as mayor. He explained how this situation came about and the weakness of his friends' political position."
"Almon, John","Almon, John 14     Horne, Townsend, and Wilkes were noted. Dyson still seemed hopelessly ill. The stock market continued to fall, apparently because of  news from the continent. Almon then discussed the news of the diplomatic maneuverings of France, Spain, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and  Portugal in which the fates of Poland and Turkey were involved.  Calcraft thought that Horne had duped Sawbridge, and he was apprehensive of war on the continent (letter of Oct. 2, 1771)."

The two groups decided to join forces and compile a document relating to  of American literature and to all phases of American history. Funding prob- lems caused this venture to stalemate.

This committee prépared in essay form  a ""Guide to Resources for Research in Ameri- can Literary History: A Preliminary Survey"" from data gathered informally--for the most part by personal interview and correspondence. The second World War caused plans for publica- tion to be deferred.

The issue was discussed in a seminar, ""A Survey and Inventory of American Literary ,"" at the 1950 meeting of MLA. The result was formal agreement on the need for some form of guide to manuscript resources. The seminar        recommended formation of a committee on lit- erary resources with Leary as chairman. In 1951 a working committee was appointed to de- vise procedures and to commence gathering of data for eventual publication of such a guide."
