The Gar- lands owned ""Whit Hall"" in Louisa Co., Va. and from that plantation the Garland Negroes were iven land after having received their freedom.

The correspondence also contains many references to political and agricultural articlé which Garland wrote to the papers of Va. As might have been expected from Garland's views on Slavery, he became a Republican after the Civil War. Judging from his correspondence, Garland was a man of choleric temper.

Many of the letters written by women connected with the Garland family give detailed accounts of the s$yles in dress during the first half of     the 19th century. Antagonism to slavery, inter- est in state politics, and an effort to improve agriculture are all reflected in these letters.  (See Meade, ora Churches...)"
