These six volumes contain the names of the freeholders of the county of Middlesex in 1802. The lists include three columns with the names of Byng, Burdett, and Mainwaring. In the  parliamentary election of 1802 the candidates were George Byng, Sir Francis Burdett, and George Boulton Mainwaring.

Further difficulty ended with Burdett's exclusion in 1806, but he ran for Westminster in 1807 and held that seat for the next thirty years.  There are some peculiarities about these volumes that raise questions about their origin and use. The tallies in Burdett's column far exceed the votes that he received in either 1802 or 1804. Part of these tally marks, however, have vertical marks drawn through them, and this group of marked tallies equals the difference between Burdett's votes in 1802"

These facts sugges that notations were made in Burdett's column for the election of 1804, perhaps for persons who failed to vote for him in that year. However, the method behind the tallies remains     obscure. The volumes might be polling lists, an hypothesis that would explain the excess of tallies over votes.  The prevalent watermark is 1803. This fact  suggests that the volumes were not used by"
