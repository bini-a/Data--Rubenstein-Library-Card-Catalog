Although his conclusions may well have been correct, his scant tables offer us only incomplete information.  Perhaps the most significant material con- cerns the taxes of the généralité. As the pre- face makes clear, the Tableau was written with popular dissatisfaction in mind. ""For several years the public has been inundated with a mul- titude of writing about the administration of public affairs and the current system of"

The Tableau outlines the nature of the taxes their assessment, and the staff employed to col- lect them. The principal tax, the taille, weighed heavily on the parishes which paid it.  Each October the Intendant would be told the amount of tax revenues Paris expected from the généralité, The Intendant would then tour his district, stopping in each élection to inform his subordinates of the bad news. These local agents in turn divided the load among the"

The corvée, forced labor used to maintain the district's highways, annoyed the district's rural population. Laborers complained that     their duty deprived them of several days' earnings, and farmers grumbled that it hindered their work in the field. Yet the author of the Tableau, well aware of the tax's unpopularity,"
Tours (Généralité),"Tours (Généralité) 13 defends the usefulness of the corvee to the dis- trict's commerce, The only alternatives seemed to be an increase in taxes, or the creation of a special corps to maintain the roads (pp. 595, 841-842).  Other tax abuses under the Ancien Régime are discussed as well. The author of the        Tableau clearly feels that commerce in Tours  suffers from the internal tariffs and from the system of state monopolies on salt and tobacco (pp. 892-94). Turning his attention to other"
Tours (Généralité),"Tours (Généralité) 14 sources of revenue, the anonymous author dis- cusses the Church's property - it owned one- fifth of the land in the généralité - with an eye on the clergy's exemptions from royal taxes; the Tableau suggests that the privileged classes might pay a greater share of the tax burden  (pp. 844, 924). The manuscript's conclusion ends with a surprise: by the imprecise calcula- tions of the day, the Tableau finds the Tours populace paying 2/3 of their yearly product in"

The world was a vast network of physicians and research me whose individual contributions were almost imme- diately influential in the medical profession. The publication of medical and scientific works was a pressing concern. There are many  incidental references to this subject. Of note are the letters of physicians, including Count Rumford, to the famous British publishers, Cadel] and Davies, who printed many of the great liter. ary and scientific works from 1739 to 1836 in England."

Papers of Richard Mead and Anthony Askew are illustrative of early London practitioners. From Oxford and Cambridge Univer sities there are papers of many scientists, such @ the Darwins and Sir Humphry Rolleston. Sir     William Osler's letters are especially interes- ting, coming from Oxford in the early twentieth century.  From Edinburgh come the papers of the eminent Sir James Simpson,  Vpwng, @"
