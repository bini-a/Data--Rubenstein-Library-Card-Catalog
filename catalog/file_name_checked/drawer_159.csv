Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company. Papers. Sanford, Lee County, North Carolina     The Atlantic and Western Railway Company, a short line carrier of freight and passengers, was chartered in 1899 to construct a railroad on the seventy miles between Sanford and Goldsboro, N.C. At its greatest extent, it  operated between Sanford and Lillington, N.C., in Lee and Harnett counties - a distance of twenty-four miles. The first two miles of track were opened between Sanford and Jonesboro in 1903, and the line was extended another six"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 2 miles to Broadway in 1905. The final segment, sixteen miles between Broadway and Lillington, was built in 1912 and put into operation in 1913. At Lillington the A&W connected with the Norfolk Southern and at Sanford with the Atlan- tic Coast Line, Seaboard, and Atlantic and Yadkin (later Southern) railroads. In 1926 the     A&W went into receivership, and on Aug. 1, 1927, it was sold and reorganized as the Atlantic and Western Railway Co., having previously been known as the Atlantic and Western Railroad Co. The 20.62 miles from Lillington to just east of"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company Jonesboro were abandoned in 1961, and the remaining freight operations were thereafter confined to the Sanford-Jonesboro area. Items of especial use for the general history of the A&W are: a letter of June 28, 1945, in Campbell's file for that year; a typewritten statement (1960's); a docket of Sept. 19, 1961; and the Annual Reports to the Interstate Commerce Commission among the financial reports. The collection consists primarily of office files, financial reports, and account books. The office files are extensive from 1918 to"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 4     1960 with some scattered material earlier and later. With a few exceptions these files are numbered, each number usually being used con- sistently over the years for the same type of correspondence, accounts, printed material, memoranda, etc. However, some file numbers, although used for many years, do not extend through the whole collection. Several files titled with names, usually for the railroad's executives or banks, are placed preceding the numerical files in each year where they exist. The collection is arranged in the following"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company  order: a folder of notes and information  about the A&W; minutes; financial reports; miscellaneous financial papers; office files grouped by years and arranged by numbers within each year (with any alphabetical files placed at the beginning of each year); periodicals; miscellany (miscellaneous legal papers,safety posters, passes, and timetables); and volumes. Large volumes and an oversize folder are shelved separately. Printed material has usually been kept within the files with the exception of some publications of the American"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company are Short Line Railroad Association that are filed among the volumes.  The office files constitute the bulk of the collection and are a substantial record for more than four decades of the history of this short line railroad. The papers are also use- ful for economic conditions in Lee and Harnett     counties. Some information can also be gleaned about the connecting railroads. Especially valuable are the files for the American Short Line Railroad Association, including both correspondence and publications, that range"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 7 widely over the interests and issues of the railroad industry and its competitors on the highways and waterways of the United States. Files for the Association of American Railroads are also extensive, and they include many printed circulars and pamphlets.  Considerable routine correspondence and accounts, material judged to have little or no research value, were discarded--perhaps sixty percent of the bulk of the original files.  Some files were kept complete, but the contents of others were discarded in varying degrees."
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 8 Sometimes only a revealing letter or two was kept from a particular year of a file that was usually discarded. The original order of the files, latest date on top, has been main- tained.  The subject entries made for this collection cite some notable references to topics but not     necessarily all references. Particularly inter- esting files are discussed below, but not all files. One approach to the collection would  be to examine all the files in one year in order to get an idea of their nature. The"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 9 amount of material for any one year is not huge.  Two volumes contain the minutes of the meet- ings of the Board of Directors and of the stock holders during 1912-1944, 1961, 1965-1966. The Sullivan file in 1925 has a list of holders of A&W stocks and bonds--mostly foreigners, es~ pecially’ French.     The account books include: Ledgers Nos. 2-3, 1905-1918; Journal No. 2, 1905-19153 Cashbooks 2-3, 1905-1940; a Journal, 1918-1924, and Cashbook, 1918-1923, both of which pertain to the control of the A&W by the U.S. Railroad"

Two other volumes are valuable not only for accounts but also  for information about property, equipment, and rolling stock: Property and Equipment Accounts     and Records, 1917-1930; and Authority for Expenditures, 1917-1930. The financial reports are extensive and  contain a vast amount of statistical informa- tion. The Annual Reports also include written"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 11 statements of considerable interest. Annual Reports are available for 1914, 1916, 1920 (for 1916-1920), 1921, 1925, and 1927-1928. The Annual Reports to the Interstate Commerce Commission are extensive: 1913-1926 and 1928- 1956. Annual Reports to the North Carolina Utilities Commission date during 1934-1953 and     1956-1959. Statements of Operations covering twelve months are available for: Nov. and Dec., 1926; 1937 (all months); and December of 1950, 1952-1955, 1958, and 1960. They include figures on freight traffic originating along the A&W,"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 12 both agricultural and manufactured commodities. Reports on the A&W by certified public account- ants date from 1929, 1931, 1932, and 1943. There is an Accounting Report as of June 30, 1917, the Date of Valuation. Four Annual Statements of Property Returned for Assessment and Taxation (N.C. Tax Commission) date from: 1917, 1919, 1926, and 1927.  The financial reports are supplemented by a considerable amount of financial papers within the office files, some of them used in pre- paring the reports. Files 194 and 404 were"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 13 regularly used for taxes and financial papers. File 308 was for per diem accounts with other railroads, and, while often routine (and often discarded), it sometimes reflected fiscal prob- lems of the A&W. File 385 recorded freight  and passenger mileage statistics. Before 1945 File 143 was used for weekly earnings and cash on hand. Files 192 and 705 recorded cars inter- changed (commodities given) with the Seaboard and Norfolk Southern, respectively, and File 723. did the same for the Atlantic Coast Line beginning in 1947.

Labor issues, like many others, were noted in Files 344 for the American Short Line Railroad Association and in its Weekl Information Bulletin that is filed among the periodicals in this collection.        The correspondence and publications of the American Short Line Railroad Association are especially valuable both for their extent and content. The Association had its headquarters in Washington, D.C., where it advised its"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 17 members and lobbied for their benefit. This organization began in 1913 as the Short Line Railroad Association of the Southeast that was transformed in 1917 into the national body. The office files for the Association date as early as 1914 and continue into the 1960's. Its Weekly Information Bulletin began in        August, 1933. A large, but incomplete, series of the Bulletin is filed among the periodicals of this collection. Issues are numerous during 1933-1939, 1942-1943, 1946, 1951-1952, with scattered ones for a few other years. The"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company . 18 Association was involved with a great many transportation matters, and its Bulletin is a substantial source of information. File 344 was the regular one for the Association. Some other appropriate files are: 114, 345, 345-A (1907-1917); 582 (1918); 114 (1919); A (1920); 520 (1925); 527 (1944); 603 (1947); 603 (1948); and 1961-1968. Association communications may turn up in other topical files also. Some history of the Association may be found in  rggies of its pamphlets in File 344 (June a. 3, and Dec. 10, 1936) and in its ""Condensed"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 19 History (File 344: 1954). The volumes include pamphlets and volumes published by the Associa- tion during 1924-1956 and also a broken run of agenda and proceedings for its annual conven- tions during 1938-1967. The archives of the Association are now in the Department of Manu- scripts and University Archives of the Cornell University Libraries.  The files for the Association of American Railroads, usually File 624, date from 1914 to 1960 with few gaps. Other material can be found in: File 483(1920, 1923-1926, 1928, 1933), File"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 20 603 (1047-1948); the Oversize Folder (some organizational charts); and elsewhere. Many printed items, especially circulars, are included in the files.  The periodicals in this collection inc lude an incomplete series, 1928-1933, of Railroad Data published by the Committee on Public Relations of the Eastern Railroads, There is also an incomplete series of the Cross Tie Bulletin 1937, 1941-1949,  Other railroad organizations of note in the collection are (see Subject File for file num-"

Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 22 Association and its Weekly Information Bulletin among the periodicals are especially useful for rate problems of the railway industry.  The effects of both World War I and World War II upon railroads can be seen during those years. World War I was a special case since the government took control of the railroads. That action caused considerable financial problems for the A&W, and protracted negotia- tions with the U.S. Railroad Administration, 1918-1928.  Agricultural products of special interest"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 23 to Lee and Harnett counties were lumber, dew- berries, watermelons, and peaches (see those subject entries for dates). In 1921 the A&W took the initiative in encouraging watermelon production by the farmers (File 222). As late as 1920 (File 404, Sept. 6) lumber was a-prin- cipal part of the A&W's freight tonnage, and     there was concern about the loss of business that would occur when the timber supply was exhausted (File 183: 1914).  There is considerable correspondence, prin- ted material, advertisements, and pictures of"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 24 railway equipment, supplies, and rolling stock in the papers, especially in Files 676, 271, and 298. File 676 was regularly used for records on rolling stock that were being pur- chased or offered for sale. There are many photographs and specifications, and occasional blueprints, for locomotives, 1916-1960 (the engines often dating earlier than 1916), both steam and diesel (See subject entry on locomotives for specific files and dates. A list is also filed in the information folder in the first box of the collection). Freight"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 25 Cars are sometimes in File 676 (and also 550 in 1923), but they are not as numerous as loco- motives since the A&W owned only a few cars. Files 271 and 298 were oriented more to equip- ment and supplies, but section cars were often in File 271.  The A&W once owned standard passenger cars as can be seen in their account books and reports. In 1917 they began using gasoline powered railroad motor cars, and the files, reports, and account books contain considerable information, including pictures, blueprints,"
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 26 and specifications. These cars were less costly to operate, and more flexible scheduling was possible. The pictures and blueprints depict a variety of types of motor cars during 1921- 1959 (Sée subject entry for railroad motor cars) The A&W operated cars constructed by the J. G. Brill Co., a leading manufacturer, and also by a North Carolina firm, the Edwards Railway Motor Car Co.  The Edwards Railway Motor Car Co. had a special relationship with the A&W. Both companies were located in Sanford. H. P."
Atlantic And Western Railway Company,"Atlantic and Western Railway Company 27 Edwards was president of the Edwards Co., and he was also general manager of the A&W for  some years prior to its reorganization in 1926-1927. Information about the Edwards Co. and its motor cars is scattered about the collection (See subject entry for the Edwards Railway Motor Car Co.). A drawing of an     Edwards motor car, one used by the A&W, is in File 676 (1923), and the company's letterhead bears a picture of it (File 249: 1927). Other  information and good pictures of the cars are in the William Alexander Smith Papers. The"

It functioned under different management into the 1940's. Cummins Diesel Engine Corp. bought a controlling interest in 1939 (File 676).  Since coal was used as fuel for so many years, the coal files, mostly File 533, have been retained. So there is much correspondence and advertising material about coal and its content and prices.

The property in 1776 was left     by John Gray to three of his nephews, with the provision that upon their death, their shares would go to a fourth nephew John Cruiekshank, of Jamaica.

James' widow, Mary, and a Charles Ellis (per- haps Charles Rose Ellis, mentioned in the D.N.B. as possessing other lands in Jamaica,     as does the Ellis in these papers) were co- owners until 1840, when they quarreled over management.
