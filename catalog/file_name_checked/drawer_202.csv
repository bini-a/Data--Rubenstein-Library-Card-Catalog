Methodist Church,"CATALOGING NOTICE        The listing of circuit and church records under names of districts within conferences Causes some problems, but it should not be changed without serious consideration. Most researchers, even Methodists, do not know to what circuits their churches belonged over  the years (and most churches were on circuits), and it is often difficult to find this infor- mation. The listing of circuits under districts distributes the records roughly seographically, and this arrangement has been"
Methodist Church,2 of considerable use over the years in locating  the various circuits that have included particular churches.
Methodist Church,"Methodist Church, U. S. A. History 1  The Methodist Episcopal Church was formed in Baltimore in 1784. A controversy over the power of the bishops led to the formation of the Methodist Protestant Church in 1830. A contro- versy over slavery caused a second division and the organization of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South in 1845. Three large Negro Methodist churches have also been established.  In December, 1938, a plan of unification was adopted by the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist “piscopal Church, South, and the Methodist Protestant Church to form the Methodist Church. &"
Methodist Church,"Methodist Church, U, S, A, History     On April 23, 1968, the Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church united to form a new denomination called the United Methodist Church."

Metz was an enlisted man in the 99th Indiana Infantry of the Union Army during the Civil War, serving from August 8, 1862, through the end of the war.  The Metz papers consist of four items and  six volumes, Four of the volumes make up a diary that Metz kept concerning his experiences as a soldier from his departure for combat duty  on November 8, 1862, through his arrival at home on June i1, 1865, The fifth volume is a"

Most of its dates are in the 1850's. Among the four items is a post card sent to Metz in 1891 infor ing him of a reunion of the 99th Indiana Infan+     try. There are, in addition, two letters, dated June 8, 1860, and August 11, 1861, addressed probably to Metz and his wife from H.C. Williams who was probably Metz's brother-in-law. The"

Battles and cam- paigns that Metz participated in include the Vicksburg Campaign (November, 1862-July,1863), the Jackson Campaign (July, 1863), the"

He seems to have been an ambulance driver throughout the war     The diary has serious defects, but it might still be useful.

He says little about personalities around him and, unless it is to make agricultural observations, does not stress the landscape. Some of the most evocative"

He clearly disapproves of the unnecessary destruction and theft, and sympathizes with the Southern victims, Metz never discusses political questions such as slavery or war aims. As for day-to-day camp life, he does not in general provide sharp ace     counts, with the exception of food, the weather, frequency of church services, and rumors. He does a moderately good job on place-names, although it is sometimes difficult to tell"

He spends too much time talking about his own illnesses, ache and pains, In short, he appears to be a man who went through many exciting experiences but, from the historian's point of view he does not communicate them very well.  There are also other problems with the diary. It appears that Metz may have had a tendency to"
"Metz, George P.","Metz, George P, 9  exaggerate things, particularly in the incident of his fight in a barroom on his way home on furlough (October 12, 1863). So perhaps, even in its limited description of events, the diary may fall short of reliability.  Perhaps the most serious problem is the con- fusion in the diary's chronology. This con-     fusion is not resolved in the typescript. Of the diary's four volumes, the first is straight- forward, covering the period November 8, 1862 - May 2, 1863, The second volume begins with the"

Although the typist calls this section ""the march through Georgia,"" the names  of the towns that Metz mentions lead one to suspect that these undated entries fall some- time during the Campaign of the Carolinas (February - April, 1865).
