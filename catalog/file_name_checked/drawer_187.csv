"Helps, Sir Arthur","Papers, ca. 1854-1872.     Sir Arthur Helps (1813-1875), clerk of the Privy Council, was the author of various works on historical, political, and literary subjects. His studies in Spanish American history are well known. Duties with the Privy Council from 1860  brought him to the attention of Queen Victoria for whom he edited a memoir and also the speeches of Prince Albert. About 1854 Sir Ar- thur met James Anthony Froude (1818-1894), pro- minent historian and man of letters, who was"

In this collection there are nineteen of Froude's letters from 1854-to 1872. They are personal communications in which the writer comments extensively on various literary and political subjects.  The first meeting between these two writers is recorded in about 1854 (watermark of 1854). Froude seems pleased with his conversations. He praises Helps's work on Spanish American"

Froude notes his friend's high opinion of Emperor Charles V and remarks that this ruler is his own greatest problem at the moment. At     this time he is debating the publication of ano- ther volume of one of his works.

On May 13, 1871, an unfavorable review of The Life of Hernando Cortes appears in the Saturday Review. Froude conjectures that Ed- ward Augustus Freeman, historian, is responsible and is attacking Froude through his friend. He notices, however, that the style of the review is unlike Freeman's.
