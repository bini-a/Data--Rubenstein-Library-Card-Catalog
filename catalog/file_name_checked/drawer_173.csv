Macon, Noxubee County, Mississippi     Maria Dyer Davies (b. 1833) was a member of a family of small phanters residing in Noxubee County, Mississippi. She lived in the county seat of Macon except for two-years on a farm nearby. She was born on Nov. 14, 1833, ""while  meteors were falling"" (p. 279).

Davies -1850"" on the first sheet of her diary. She identified herself as ""Maria"" in a quota- tion on page 15.  On Nov. 15, 1863, Miss Davies married the Rev.
