Kirby was a Revolutionary veteran, distinguished lawyer, early member of the Society of the Cincinnati, the first general grand high priest of the Royal Arch Masons of the United States, land agent and speculator, and staunch Republican (Jeffersonian) politi- cian.

Hence, the owners of this store were Koonce & Horner. There is also a short inventory of Koonce's goods at his store and house (a back page).

Labor Archives,"Labor Archives  The Labor Archives, as of Aug. 31, 1976, has been separated into individual collections, and does not represent a single collection title. These various groups of papers all contain ma- terial concerning the labor movement in the South, primarily during the 1940s and early  1950s. Most of the collections are the records of various labor unions.  The collecting program at Duke University was begun in the early 1950's. Its original purpose was ""to establish a regional collection"
Labor Archives,"Labor Archives 2  of printed and non-printed records of the growt and development of the Southern labor movement.' Although the program covered the South, it con- centrated on the states of North Carolina, Sout Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. A major goal became to preserve the non-print material dealing with state, local, or city-central or- ganizations,  A collection of material has been held to-  ether under the title, ""Labor Miscellany."" fncluded is the Manuscript Department Corres-"

The Congress of Industrial Organizations (C.I.0.) accounts for the bulk of the material in the Labor Archives, American Federation of  Labor items comprising only about six per cent of the total. Records of the C.1.0. Organizing Committees for Tennessee, South Carolina, Vir- ginia, and North Carolina form a large part of  the archives."
Labor Archives,"Labor Archives 4  The cataloging of this large, modern collec- tion differs from the manner of cataloging the majority of the collections in this department. Since the papers have not been cataloged in detail, the entries made for the Autograph File  may be incomplete. Correspondence usually was indexed only when there was a whole folder of correspondence for a person or a significant  number of letters for a person throughout the  collection,"
Labor Archives,"Labor Archives 5  Only general subject entries have been made, Some headings were made under the title ""Labor Unions"" for workers in various industries. A sample entry would be ""Labor’ Unions. Textile Workers."" These entries were made only in cases     where an entire collection represents one indus- try or where there is a relatively large amount of material for an industry in one collection. In all cases entries have been made under the names of specific labor unions."
