This collection consists of the political and professional papers of David John Lewis, noted exponent of a low tariff and U. S. Representative. Lewis, born the son of a poor Welsh miner in 1869 in Pennsylvania,  moved with his family to the coal fields in western Maryland where he educated himself while he worked in the mines. When he was twenty-three years old he was admitted to the  Maryland bar. Ten years later in 1902 he was  @"

In 1916 he  ran unsuccessfully for the Senate, and President Wilson subsequently appointed him as a charter member of the U. S. Tariff Commission. Lewis, by now a well-informed antagonist of high tariffs, utilized the Commission to propagate     his views. When President Coolidge failed to reappoint him in 1925, Lewis returned to his home in Cumberland, Maryland, to practice law. Again in 1930 he was elected to the House of"

When he retired from the House in 1939 President Roosevelt appointed him to the National Mediation Board. Lewis retired in 1943 and died nine years later.  The collection reflects Lewis' interest in tariff legislation. Letters late in 1916 and early 1917 are the original recommendations to President Wilson urging Lewis' appointment to the newly-established U. S. Tariff Commission. There are letters from among others, labor  unions, philanthropists, single tax advocates,"

A brief series of letters from 1917 to 1925 relates to Lewis’ tenure on the Tariff Commission; they pertain mainly to his efforts to collect data on costs of production and productive capability in the U. S.  After a lapse of a few years other letters relate to the tariff.

These letters contain in- formation about the Rawleigh Tariff Bureau whick he established and with which Lewis was asso- ciated for a time before his re-election to the House in 1930. In 1929, the year of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff bill, Lewis attracted hun- dreds of letters from individuals and lobbying groups relating to the proposed tariff and related matters.

The earlier letters, running from 1801 to 1834, are from Thomas Lewis to his father, Samuel Lewis. Thomas was a minister of undeter- mined denomination who came south, perhaps in  an effort to cure his tuberculosis, and settled in Sunbury, Liberty Co., Ga., as a minister and an instructor in a local academy.

The first letter to Milo Lewis is dated May 12, 1834, and gives no clue to the relation-  ship with Samuel and Thomas Lewis, though it seems fairly safe to assume one since all of the Lewises lived somewhere in New Haven County, Conn., and since Milo had a son named Samuel.
