U. S. Army. Corps of Engineers,"U.S. Army. Corps of Engineers. Survey of the Columbia River, 1891. Washington, D.C.     In 1890 Congress appropriated funds for the surveying and improvement of the Columbia River in Washington state, including $10,000 for sur- veying the river from the international boundar line southward to Rock Island Rapids. In 1891 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made this sur- vey as far south as the Okanogan River. Willia Cuthbert led the team that made the survey. superior was Capt. Thomas W.

Copies of the reports by Symons and Cuthbert are filed in the Information Folder of this collection.        Two albums contain 74 photographs (7 1/4 x 9 in.), albumen prints, from the survey of 1891.

The scenes are along the Columbia River in Ferry and Stevens counties in northeastern Washington from the Canadian border southward 88 miles to Elbow Bend 17 miles north of the mouth of the Spokane  River. Capt. Symons wrote that ""a large number of photographs was taken of the river and its vicinity,"" and he sent with his report a set ""of those which most clearly illustrate the river, especially at the bad places.""

The latter is only a distant view, but there are fine pictures of the tiny settlements at Little Dalles and Indian Ferry (Nos. 18, 20, 25).     The name of the photographer is not in the albums, and it was not given in the reports by Symons and Cuthbert. However, Cuthbert's report in 1892 (Annual Report of the Chief of Engineers,"
U. S. Army. Corps of Engineers,"U.S. Army. Corps of Engineers 7a United States Army, to the Secretary of War, for the Year 1892, Part I) identifies the photo- graphers as O. C. Yocum and a Mr. Warren. It was Warren who took the photographs above the Spokane River including all of those in these two albums. Warren made 71 photographs.  The albums probably belonged to the photo-              grapher or to someone on the survey, because there are notations on the reverse of the last board in Album II that strongly suggest that relationship.

The inter- pretation of state election laws was sometimes dwelt upon learnedly and lengthily, but at other times these laws were dismissed as in- applicable.  Broadly speaking, the C. of E. took the  position that the results of a Congressional election, certified to be correct, by the gov. of a state or territory, could not be set aside save upon presentation of the most substantia 1 evidence. Hence, in a number of instances the men challenging a “6 member made serious"

In some of the later election contro- versies references were made to earlier elections investigated by the C. of E. and even to cases involving the seating of members     of the British House of Commons. In many contested elections it appears that the C. of E. did not have enough facts to recommend appropriate action to the House of Represent- atives. One surmises that the House itself
United States. Congress. House of Representatives,"F | United States Congress. House. Com. of Elections did not add many facts to those presented to it.  While this Journal is not a day-to-day report, it does in the main, list events chronologically, It covers not only contested elections, but resignations, deaths, and seats     given to those chosen in special elections.

C. physician, historian, and plagiarist, Dr. David Ramsay (1749-1815), unsuccessfully cons tests the election of William Loughton Smith (1758-1812) to the U. S. House of Represent- atives.

Ramsay charged that Smith was ineligible, under thee provisions of the U. 8S. Constitution which required seven years as a U. S. citizen. On May 22 the House voted 36 to one in favor of the seated member Smith. Pp. 6-11 are concerned with a letter and sundry petitions maintaining that the four U. S. Representatives from N.

These seven items are somewhat enigmatical, but from internal evidence it seems that Unthank borrowed $10,000 from H. W. Davis. Unthank then issued one hundred $100 bonds covering the loan, and secured by 520 acres of delta land across the river in Arkansas, The bonds are complete with Coupons, each good for the payment of $3 inter- est semiannually, and each coupon was signed by Unthank, The purpose of the loan is nowhere in- dicated. It was to be repaid at the end of five years, and all Qpernents of principle and interest were to be made at the Branch of the Planter's Bank of Tennessee at Memphis,"
