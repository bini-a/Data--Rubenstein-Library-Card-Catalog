Peter married Catherine O'Hara (1760- 1828), and they had at least seven children, one of whom was John McMullen (1791-1870).

Having completed two months training, the men of Stanfords' Battery (Miss.), under Capt. Thomas J. Stanford, Have been trans- ferred to Confederate service. On Sept. 7, 1861, they leave Grenada, Miss. and by November 20, the battery is attached to Pillow's Brigade of the Army of Tennessee. During the next two years, Magee chronicles the role of Stanford's Battery in the western campaigns of the Civil War."
"Magee, John Euclid","Magee, John Euclid. 2 Magee's account of events is mostly dispassion- ate except on those occasions when he succumbs to loneliness and self-pity.

On Apr. 24, 1862, he witnesses the punishment in- flicted upon a Confederate deserter.  It is noticeable in entries of June 10, Oct.     22, 1862, and July 9, 1863, that Gen. Braxton Bragg is extremely unpopular with the soldiers. Bragg is hated as a strict disciplinarian (June 10, Aug. 28, Sept. 12, 1862) and a blunderer."

Cheatham cursed the driver of a forage wagon.     By Nov. 1, 1862, he has lost all his baggage and extra clothing. Soon afterward there is a re-organization of officers of the battery. Lieut. Hugh R.

Neither William III nor his two predecessors allowed their wives any participation in governmental affairs (letter     of April 21, 1849). So Sophia, a woman of intellect and character, was limited to whatever influence she had within the royal family. Her  life, outside of routine public functions, was"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 2 centered upon her family and friends: “my only pretention in this world is to have friends,"" she wrote (Dec. 23, 1864). Several of them were persons of historical importance in Western Europe.  The Queen's most intimate friend was Lady Malet. Their relationship dates from the period     when her husband was secretary of the embassy at. The Hague, 1836-1843. The letters began in 1842 and continued into 1877, the year of  Sophia's death, and their frequency ranged"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 13 between nine and forty-six during a year’s time. The difficulty for any queen to acquire and keep a confidante must be considerable, but Sophia's isolation, personality, and the unhappiness of her life made it imperative. She seems to have been fortunate in her choice, for she wrote on Nov. 13, 1864: ""After all, more than twenty years are passed since we know each other, & our affection never changed."" ""No one in this world,"" she avowed,"" not my sister herself,  knows so much about me as you do"" (June 3-6,"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 14 1847); and “there is not in this wide world one person I esteem & respect more than you, not One person to whom my whole life has been laid bare as to you"" (March 30, 1849); “you are the only person with whom I can think, sob out my thoughts."" (Sept. 14, 1849). In the 1860's she could still write to Lady Malet that ""you are the only person with whom I can think aloud"" (May 2, 1861) and that ""I love no one as I love you & the more the years pass, the more I attach  myself to the one friend,:.who remained true &"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 15 faithful in all the trials of life” (Oct. 22, 1865). The content as well as the frequency  of the correspondence supports the Queen's ex- pressions, for she wrote most frankly about events and persons--even the King's personality and mistresses. Only one episode of discord is apparent--a bitter memorandum of Oct. 10, 1867,     in which Lady Malet severely criticized her friend. She did not send the memorandum to the Queen, and no apparent disturbances occurred in  the relationship then or later. The ill feel-"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 16  ings derived from unsuccessful efforts to obtain diplomatic assignments for Sir Alexander Malet who retired in 1866. Lord Stanley, reported Sophia, twice selected Malet for Brussels, but Queen Victoria refused on both occasions (Dec. 9, 1872). In contrast, there is a touching memorandum of Oct., 1864, in which Lady Malet described a visit with the Queen at Frankfort. Sophia was decidedly Anglophile, as her other relationships attest. Her most particular  friends and frequent correspondents were Lord"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 17 Clarendon, Lord Cowley, Lord Napier, and their wives. Clarendon's death in 1870 was a blow  to the Queen, for ""in many respects he had taken my dear father's place""--they wrote weekly (July 8, 1870). ‘His loss made her ""a stranger to English politics"" (Dec. 30, 1871), and her re- marks about British affairs had included infor-     mation and quotations from him, an exceptional example being his explanation of why he did not become foreign secretary in 1859 (letter of  June 28). Lord Stanley found her an excellent"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 18 conversationalist and was astonished at her knowledge, for she spoke “of English politics and English public men as very few of our coun- try women could have done” (his letter of Sept. 24, 1850, and in the other file of Malet cor- respondencé). Her numerous remarks about the Cowleys and Napiers were usually personal (and valuable for a biographer), but she did enclose three of Cowley's letters of 1849 in which he discussed the revolutionary events in Germany  and the struggles between liberals and conserva-"
Malet Family,"Malet Family ee tives and Prussia and Austria. Lord Llanover was another friend--his letter of July, 1859, described the political situation in the Bri- tish cabinet and House of Commons. Lady Salis- bury, who later married Stanley and became Lady Derby, was another important correspondent. Other English friends were Charles Villiers     (Clarenton's brother), Lady Ely, Lady Westmor- land, and Lady William Russell. Even in Holland it was an English woman, Madame de Tuyll (the  sister of Lord Sandhurst) of whom Sophia wrote"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 20  on Feb. 12, 1869: “I had not loved her as I loved you, but she was the only person here with whom I could talk & who had a lively inter- est in all that is going on, free from petty gossip of a small town. Sophia's Anglophilia     shocked a Russian acquaintance: ""When I spoke of the superiority of English women to foreign-  ers, she was as astonished as if I had declared they had 12 fingers; because she can not go be- yond the surface of things. (Dec. 9, 1872).""  She was‘not, however, ‘blinded to the defects"
Malet Family,"Malet Family ' 21 of her friends, and her remark, “I remain de- voted to my friends, whatever their faults, but I see the faults"" (Aug. 20, 1867), is substanti- ated by many comments in her letters.  Her English leanings included unsuccessful attempts in the late 1850's to promote a mar- riage between the Prince of Orange and one of     Queen Victoria's daughters, preferably Princess Helena. Sophia wanted the alliance in order to reduce Russian influence (Jan. 22, 1858). In  1862, Victoria was still peeved that the Prince"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 22     had not married her preference for the match, Princess Alice (Oct. 12).  Queen Sophia's antipathies were as ardent as her Anglophilia. A southern German, she de- é spised Prussians and feared Prussia. She found few Russians to her liking, and her feelings about them were colored by enmity with two Rus-  sian grand duchesses: her mother-in-law, Queen Anna of the Netherlands, a daughter of Czar Paul I; and her sister-in-law, Queen Olga of  Wirttemberg, daughter of Nicholas I.  Sophia"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 23 regarded her subjects in the Netherlands as a somber lot. ""The silent gloom of Dutch people quite enervates me,"" she wrote (July 4, 1861), except in winter ""on the ice--when the Dutch get gay and graceful"" (Jan. 9, 1868). For the French people she had scant respect. She found English ideas more palatable than French ones     (Aig. 31, 1867). . The Queen's unfavorable opinion of the French did not prevent her from forming her strongest  attachment with a major ruling family--the Bona-"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 24 partes. Indeed, they were related, for the Queen's Aunt Catherine of Wliirttemberg married Napoleon's brother Jerome. Their son, Prince Napoleon, was a close friend, a correspondent of at least twenty years (Jan. 17, 1859), and Sophia had a lot to say about him. Of more importance was her admiration for Napoleon III, no relation, and her correspondence with him and Empress Eugénie. Sophia's analyses of the Emperor and his wife and her many comments about  them are a valuable aspect of this collection."
Malet Family,"Malet Family 25 She was often concerned that the English did not recognize that an alliance with Napoleon served their vital interests. Her warning on May’ 16, 1859, proved prophetic: Things are looking awfully warlike. I put aside all my opinions, my sympathies, but be- lieve me: if Germany attacks France, you will see a strange result.

They  never wrote ""but on occasions, death, births, marriages"" (Aug. 4, 1867). Her contrasting opinions of the English and French courts de-  finitely favored Paris (Feb. 16, 1860). Adolphe"

The affairs of England, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Russia were the principal political and diplomatic topics of the corres- pondence. The Queen commented upon internal Dutch politics occasionally but usually with brief generalities. ‘Exceptions are the series of letters following her husband's accession to the throne in March, 1849. Her letter of April 21 is a revealing exposition of her position and  influence as queen, wife, and woman (also March"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 28     30 and May 1). On March 10-17, 1848, she re= ported on the constitutional crisis, including the King's strategic interview with Boreel van Hogelanden. Presumably this reticence about Dutch politics was not caused by prudencé, for she was quite frank about the King's misdeeds. She did believe that her. letters were read  (March 25, 1854), and once Lady Malet found a coin inside that a third party had inadver- tently left there (Jan. 15, 1860).  The value of this correspondence lies not"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 29  only with the Queen's information and judgments about European affairs but also with her com- ments and opinions about the myriad people whom she met, knew, or heard about. They included rulers, nobles, diplomats, politicians, mili- tary men, and others whose actions, public ca- reers, or court connections made them topics of     gossip and news. English, French, German, Dutch, and Austrian figures are especially to be found, but also occasional Russians, Italians,  and others. She remarked often about the diplo-"

A literary friend and correspondent was the English poetess, Caroline Norton, who dedicated Stuart of Dunleath to the Queen. When that book neared publication, Mrs. Norton discussed it, her efforts for the rights of separated women, and various of her other publications, inclu- ding some issued without her name (enclosed in letter of Feb. 10, 1851). Sophia also knew  the American historian, John Lothrop Mottey,"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 31     famed for his Rise of the Dutch Republic.  Two close friends in Germany were Princess Frederica Maria of Wuirttemberg, later Countess Taubenheim (Nov. 14, 1866, and Jan. 5, 1867) ry ne Duchess Stephanie of Baden (Feb. 3, 1860).  The Queen died from heart failure (dropsy) in June, 1877. Lady Malet received reports about her condition and funeral from Lady Sherborne and Elizabeth Lecky, wife of histor- ian William E. H. Lecky."
Malet Family,"Malet Family 32 Unfortunately the Queen destroyed all, or « virtually all, of Lady Malet's letters, as she mentioned on a number of occasions: Feb. 6, 1849; Nov. 13, 1864; Feb. 13, 1866; and Feb. 11, 1867; Aug. 30-31, 1870. She considered their correspondence too frank and personal either for contemporary or future eyes. Lady Malet, howe:     ever, did nad follow instructions to destroy the Queen's letters as she requested (Feb. 13, 1866) It is unclear to what degree Sophia followed  this policy with her other correspondents."
Malet Family,"Malet Family 33 Lord Napier was at least a partial exception (Feb. 11, 1867): ""I now keep Lord Napier's let- ters, they are so:very curious & interesting-& the persons he mentions do not interest any  one here."" She also feared that Prussia would someday annex Holland and that her letters would fall into those hated hands (Aug. 30-31, 1870). Besides Napier, another exception may have been the King of WUrttemberg, for she noted arrang- ing her father's letters (Nov. 13, 1864). The answer to this question lies in the Dutch royal"

However, the photograph in this collection is not one of those mentioned, for the words ""Gedeponeerd in     1877"" (Registered in 1877) appear in fine print beneath the bottom edge of the picture. She al- so sent a miniature (Dec. 18, 1852°& Jan. 5,  1853). Lady Malet sent a bust of herself (May"

Edward Henry Stanley,, Fifteenth Earl of Derby (1826-1893), had a distinguished politi- cal career that began with election to the House of Commons in 1848. At about that time, in 1849 or 1850, he began a correspondence with Lady Malet after they had met at the country residence of Lord Brougham who was Lady Malet's"
Malet Family,"Malet Family _ 37 stepfather (event noted in Stanley's letter of Jan. 19, 1856). Lady Malet spent most of her time on the continent where her husband had diplomatic assignments, and she was anxious for the news of politics and society. She and Stan- ley also shared an interest in literature and history. He was one of the few people who knew that she was the author of Violet, and he also mentioned some essays that she had written but had not published (March 11, May 16, 1851).  The result of these interests and Stanley's per-"
Malet Family,"Malet Family 38 sonality and ability as a letter writer is an exceptional correspondence represented by forty- seven of his letters, 1850-1867. Most of the letters date between 1850 anil857. His refer- ence of Oct. 23, 1867, to their correspondence suggests that it had not flourished in the — 1860's as it had in the 1850's.
