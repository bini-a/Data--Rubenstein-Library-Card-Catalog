Papers, 1885 Wilmington, N. C.  Thomas Fanning Wood was an eminent physician of Wilmington. In 1877, chiefly through his efforts, the General Assembly established the State Board of Health. In 1879 the Board elect- ed Dr. Wood its first secretary, and he served in that capacity until he died in 1892. He also edited the North Carolina Medical Journal.  A letter of May 20, 1885, from Alvan Went- worth Chapman to Dr. Wood concerns the Reverend Moses Ashley Curtis, botanist and minister, whose botanical studies led him to specialize in fungi and become a noted authority on that   \n",

Chapman was responding to an inquiry by Wood about materials for his writing a sketch of Curtis. Chapman says he corresponded with Curtis for many years and comments on his per- sonality as reflected in his letters. He says that he has destroyed all the letters he re- ceived from Curtis and tells why. He goes on to     list several of Curtis's printed works on the botany of North Carolina and to say that Henry William Ravenel was probably more intimate with Curtis than any other botanist.   \n",
