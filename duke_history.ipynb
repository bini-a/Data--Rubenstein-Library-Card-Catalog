    "First we will be exploring the presidents of Duke University and their prevalence within the card catalog. The current President, Vincent Price, will be excluded since his last name is commonly found in the cards with another meaning and his time at Duke is well past the time of the catalog. Interestingly enough, the penultimate President's name appears in the cards (Richard Brodhead) despite his not coming to Duke until after the card catalog was digitized. Perhaps this eponymous figure was an ancestor of the one we know in relation to Duke today. We will be searching by last name, to see the frequency of the Presidents' last names in the catalog. A few of the presidents have surnames that have alternate meanings or uses (e.g., York, Wood) and we will attempt to remove the non-name occuraces of these. A disclamer to this analysis is that this method only captures names that were both properly spelled in the catloging process and translated into text accurately by our OCR software; it is likely that there are some misspelled names that did not make it thorugh the calculations."
