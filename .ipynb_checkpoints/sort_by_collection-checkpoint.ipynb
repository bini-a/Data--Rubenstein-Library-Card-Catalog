He writes of selling books and harvesting in the area around Springfield to make money at the end of some of the school  sessions.   \n",

While he says he is against it, he also admits that he does not have a solution as to how it could be ended.  There are several letters written between 1861 and 1864, between sisters in the Yonce family about the affect of the Civil War on their lives.     They are primarily from Sophia*in Gladesboro (Sept. 9, 1861; Oct. 1, 1863; Apr. 16, Dec. 1 and 17, 1864; Jan. 19, 1865 and Sept. 2, year not given). She expresses how hard it is to  * (gssell   \n",
