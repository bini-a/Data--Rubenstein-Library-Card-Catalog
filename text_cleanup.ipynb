Acker accepted the as signment, and, posing as a deserter, mage his wa  to Spanish Fort. During his stay there, wrote Acker, he so ingratiated himself with the Con- federate commander, a General Kirby, that he was brevetted a captain in the Rebel service.       \n",

Later, when he had obtained all the information which he desired, Acker went to her house, disclosed his true identity, and gained her assistance in making his escape. There are several reasons to question this romantic tale. In the first place, General N. P. Banks was not in command of the Mississipp Department at the time above mentioned and had not held that position for some months.  ¢&          \n",

Moreover, many of the details do not ring true. Why would a deserter be allowed to go where he pleased? Spanish Fort would have been an unlikely place indeed for a Yankee to request to go. The Confederate \"General Kirby\" mentioned is also a puzzle. If the writer means General Edmund Kirby-Smith, tha is another inaccuracy, for Kirby-Smith was in command of the Trans-Mississippi Department  from February, 1863, until he surrendered his troops on June 2, 1865.

Pe Would a nineteen year old girl of Mobile society have entertained a gentleman alone, either at mid-day or at seven in the evening? Finally, it should be pointed out that Acker's regiment moved to Helena, Arkansas, on October 10, 1864, and remained there until Feb. 23, 1865. Accord- ing to Acker's service record he was with his re  giment from September, 1864, through June, 1865, and was not absent on detached service at any time during that period.
